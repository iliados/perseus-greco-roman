<head>Antiphon</head>
<p>ANTIPHON: 480 &mdash; 411 B.C. Approximate period of extant work, 421 &mdash; 411 B.C. <title>Life</title> in <bibl n="Jebb Orators 1.1"><title>Attic Orators</title>, I. 1</bibl> &mdash; 17.
</p>
<p>Style. Antiphon, the earliest forensic speech-writer (<foreign lang="greek">λογογράφος</foreign>), represents that early style of Attic prose composition which Dionysius (<title lang="la">de comp. verb.</title> 22 &mdash; 24) calls the &lsquo;austere&rsquo; or &lsquo;rugged&rsquo; (<foreign lang="greek">αὐστηρὰ ἁρμονία</foreign>), as distinguished from the &lsquo;smooth&rsquo; (<foreign lang="greek">γλαφυρά</foreign>) of Isokrates, and the &lsquo;middle&rsquo; (<foreign lang="greek">μέση</foreign>) of Demosthenes. Its leading characteristics are (1) dignity: &lsquo;the movement of the whole is to be slow and majestic, impressing by its weight and grandeur, not charming by its life and flow&rsquo;: (2) reliance on contrasts of single words: e.g. <foreign lang="greek">γνωρισταί  δικασταί   δοξασταί  κριταί</foreign>, Antiph. <title>De Caed. Her.</title> &sect; 94: (3) bold, but not florid, imagery: e.g. <foreign lang="greek">ἐπὶ τῇ ἐμαυτοῦ ἀπαιδίᾳ ζῶν ἔτι κατορυχθήσομαι</foreign>, <title>Tetr.</title> II. B &sect; 10: (4) sparing use of the &lsquo;figures of thought&rsquo;, <foreign lang="greek">σχήματα διανοίας</foreign>, &mdash; as irony, rhetorical question, etc.: see <bibl n="Jebb Orators 2.7"><title>Attic Orators</title>, I. 29</bibl>: (5) predominance of direct appeals to feeling (pathos) over subtle expression of character (&ecirc;thos): (6) in the structure of sentences, the transition from a &lsquo;continuous&rsquo; style, <foreign lang="greek">λέξις εἰρομένη</foreign>, in which clauses are simply strung together, to a periodic style, <foreign lang="greek">λέξις κατεστραμμένη</foreign>.
</p>
<p>Thucydides belongs to the same stage of Attic prose as Antiphon, differing from him principally in (1) a more pregnant brevity: (2) a tendency to peculiar arrangements of words, caused by desire of emphasis on the key-note of the thought: e.g. <bibl n="Thuc. 5.91">Thuc. v. 91</bibl>, <foreign lang="greek">ἐπὶ σωτηρίᾳ νῦν τοὺς λόγους ἐροῦμεν τῆς ὑμετέρας πόλεως</foreign>, instead of <foreign lang="greek">ἐπὶ σωτ. τῆς ὑμετ. πόλ.</foreign>: (3) a tendency to bring a greater number of clauses within the compass of a single sentence, in order that the whole of a complex thought may be seen at one view. &mdash; See <bibl n="Jebb Orators 2.1"><title>Attic Orators</title>, I. 18</bibl> &mdash; 44. On Antiphon's Works in general, ib. 45 &mdash; 70. <pb n="202"/>

<head><foreign lang="greek">Τετραλογία</foreign>2 speech 2</head>
<p>The <title>Tetralogies</title> have this special interest, that they represent rhetoric in its transition from the technical to the practical stage, from the schools to the lawcourts and the ecclesia. Antiphon stood between the sophists who preceded and the orators who followed him as the first Athenian who was at once a theorist of rhetoric and a master of practical eloquence. The Tetralogies hold a corresponding place between merely ornamental exercises and real orations. Each of them forms a set of four speeches, supposed to be spoken in a trial for homicide. The accuser states his charge, and the defendant replies; the accuser then speaks again, and the defendant follows with a second reply. The imaginary case is in each instance sketched as lightly as possible; details are dispensed with; only the essential frame-work for discussion is supplied. Hence, in these skeleton-speeches, the structure and anatomy of the argument stand forth in naked clearness, stripped of everything accidental, and showing in bold relief the organic lines of a rhetorical pleader's thought. &mdash;  <bibl n="Jebb Orators 3.1"><title>Attic Orators</title>, I. 45</bibl> f. The Tetralogies are distinguished by their <emph>practical</emph> character from the &lsquo;displays&rsquo; of the sophists as well as from the &lsquo;declamations&rsquo; of the Augustan age.
</p>
<p>The subject of the <title>Second Tetralogy</title> is the death of a boy accidentally struck by a javelin while watching a youth practising at the gymnasium. The boy's father accuses the youth &mdash; whose father defends him &mdash; of accidental homicide; and the case comes before the court of the Palladion. In order to understand the issues raised, it is necessary to keep in mind the Greek view of accidental homicide. This view was mainly a religious one. The death was a pollution. Some person, or thing, must be answerable for that pollution, and must be banished from the State, which would else remain defiled. In a case like the supposed one, three hypotheses were possible: &mdash; that the cause of the impurity had been the thrower, the person struck, or the missile. There was a special court &mdash; that held at the Prutaneion &mdash; for the trial of inanimate things which had caused death. Here, however, the question is only of living agents. The judges have nothing whatever to do with the question as to how far either was morally to blame. The question is simply which of them is to be considered as, in fact, the author or cause of the death.
</p>
<p>The accuser's first speech consists only of a few sentences, in which he says that the facts admit of no doubt. A homicide has been committed, though an involuntary one. The penalty demanded is the banishment of the accused, in order that Athens may not be polluted by his presence (<foreign lang="greek">μὴ περιορᾶν ἅπασαν τὴν πόλιν ὑπὸ τούτου μιαινομένην</foreign> &sect; 2). It is expressed by the phrase <foreign lang="greek">εἴργειν ὧν ὁ νόμος εἴργει</foreign> ib. and <foreign lang="greek">γ.</foreign> &sect; 11. The <pb n="203"/> condemned person remained in exile until the relatives of the deceased gave their consent to his return (<foreign lang="greek">ἕως ἂν αἰδέσηταί τις τῶν ἐν γένει τοῦ πεπονθότος</foreign>: cp. Dem. or. XXXVII. <title>Adv. Pantaen.</title> &sect; 59, or. XLIII. <title>Adv. Macart.</title> &sect; 57): the usual statement that the term was limited to a year (<foreign lang="greek">ἀπενιαυτισμός</foreign>) needs confirmation, at least for Athens. See K. F. Hermann, <title>Antiq.</title> I. &sect; 104. 11.
</p>
<div3 type="section" n="1">
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ἀπράγμονας</lemma> <foreign lang="greek">ἀπράγμων</foreign>, the man &lsquo;of quiet life&rsquo;, who  keeps out of law-suits and politics: <foreign lang="greek">ἡσύχιος</foreign>, the man &lsquo;of peaceful disposition&rsquo;. In regard to law-suits, the Athenian <foreign lang="greek">ἀπράγμων</foreign> stood in favourable contrast with the <foreign lang="greek">συκοφάντης</foreign>, but in politics he was despised: <bibl n="Thuc. 2.40">Thuc. II. 40</bibl>, <foreign lang="greek">τὸν μηδὲν τῶνδε</foreign> (<foreign lang="greek">τῶν πολιτικῶν</foreign>) <foreign lang="greek">μετέχοντα οὐκ ἀπράγμονα ἀλλὰ ἀχρεῖον νομίζομεν</foreign>.
</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">τολμᾶν τά τε ἄλλα</lemma>=<foreign lang="greek">τά τε ἄλλα τολμᾶν</foreign>. For <foreign lang="greek">τε</foreign> misplaced, cp. <bibl n="Thuc. 4.10">Thuc. IV. 10</bibl>, <foreign lang="greek">ἢν ἐθέλωμέν τε μεῖναι καὶ μὴ καταπροδοῦναι</foreign>.
</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">τὴν ἀκρίβειαν</lemma> &lsquo;the exact truth&rsquo;. <bibl n="Thuc. 1.22">Thuc. I. 22</bibl>, <foreign lang="greek">χαλεπὸν ἦν</foreign>  <foreign lang="greek">διαμνημονεῦσαι τὴν ἀκρίβειαν αὐτὴν τῶν λεχθέντων</foreign>, &lsquo;the exact form&rsquo;.
</p></div3>
<div3 type="section" n="2">
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">καὶ αὐτός</lemma> &lsquo;myself also&rsquo;: &mdash; alluding to the <emph>accuser's</emph> previous appeal (<foreign lang="greek">α.</foreign> &sect; 2), <foreign lang="greek">ὑμᾶς δὲ ἀξιῶ ἐλεοῦντας, κ.τ.λ.</foreign>
</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ἀκριβέστερον</lemma> &lsquo;with more subtlety&rsquo; &mdash; referring especially to the distinction which he proceeds to draw between <foreign lang="greek">πράκτορες τῶν ἀκουσίων</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">τῶν παθημάτων αἴτιοι</foreign> (&sect; 6). The accuser, in his second speech (<foreign lang="greek">γ.</foreign> &sect; 3), says, <foreign lang="greek">μὴ ἔργα φανερὰ ὑπὸ πονηρᾶς λόγων ἀκριβείας</foreign> (&lsquo;a quibbling subtlety&rsquo;) <foreign lang="greek">πεισθέντες ψευδῆ τὴν ἀλήθειαν τῶν πραχθέντων ἡγήσησθε</foreign>.
</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">μὴ...τὴν κρίσιν ποιήσασθαι</lemma> With the vulg., <foreign lang="greek">μὴ διὰ τὰς προειρημένας τύχας ἀποδεξαμένους, κ.τ.λ.</foreign>, we can only render: &lsquo;I ask you to entertain my defence, and not to give your judgment &mdash; under the influence of those mischances to which I have referred &mdash; on grounds of opinion rather than of fact&rsquo;. But the position of <foreign lang="greek">ἀποδεξαμένους...ἀπολογίαν</foreign>, inserted between <foreign lang="greek">μή</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">ποιήσασθαι</foreign>, is then intolerable. Blass conjectures <foreign lang="greek">ἴσα ταῖς προειρημέναις τύχαις</foreign>: i.e. &lsquo;I beg you not to receive my defence in the spirit &mdash; not to view them in the light &mdash; of the mischances&rsquo;, etc. The objections are (1) the phrase <foreign lang="greek">ἴσα ταῖς... τύχαις</foreign>, which surely will not yield such a sense: (2) the necessarily favourable sense of <foreign lang="greek">ἀποδεξαμένους</foreign>. I propose, retaining <foreign lang="greek">διὰ...τὰς τύχας</foreign>, to insert <foreign lang="greek">ἧττόν τι</foreign> before <foreign lang="greek">ἀποδεξαμένους</foreign>: &lsquo;I beg you not to entertain my defence the less favourably on account of the mischances to which I have referred&rsquo;. See p. 55, &sect; 8, for another instance in which <foreign lang="greek">ἧττον</foreign> seems to have dropped out. &mdash; An alternative remedy would be <pb n="204"/> to change <foreign lang="greek">ἀποδεξαμένους</foreign> for some partic. of opposite meaning (&lsquo;having rejected&rsquo;); but neither <foreign lang="greek">ἀποδοκιμάσαντας</foreign> nor <foreign lang="greek">ἀπωσαμένους</foreign> is palaeographically probable.
</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">πρὸς τῶν λέγειν δυν</lemma> &lsquo;is on the side of&rsquo;, &lsquo;favours&rsquo;, those who can speak. <bibl n="Eur. Alc. 57">Eur. <title>Alc.</title> 57, <foreign lang="greek">πρὸς τῶν ἐχόντων, Φοῖβε, τὸν νόμον τίθης</foreign>, &lsquo;for the rich&rsquo; &mdash; in their interest.
</bibl></p></div3>
<div3 type="section" n="3">
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">παρὰ γνώμην τούτων</lemma> &lsquo;The result has completely disappointed these expectations&rsquo;:=<foreign lang="greek">παρὰ ταῦτα ἃ ἤλπιζον</foreign>, the genitive <foreign lang="greek">τούτων</foreign> depending on the idea of <term>contrariety</term> implied in <foreign lang="greek">παρὰ γνώμην</foreign>, as if he had written <foreign lang="greek">συμβέβηκέ μοι ἐναντία τούτων</foreign>.
</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">μειράκιον</lemma> usu. denotes the age from about 14 to 18: <foreign lang="greek">παῖς</foreign> is younger. Xen. <title>Symp.</title> IV. 17, <foreign lang="greek">ὥσπερ γε παῖς γίγνεται καλός, οὕτω καὶ μειράκιον καὶ ἀνὴρ καὶ πρεσβύτης</foreign>.
</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">οὐχ ὕβρει οὐδὲ ἀκολασίᾳ</lemma> &lsquo;insolence or wantonness&rsquo;. The essence of <foreign lang="greek">ὕβρις</foreign> is that it indulges the sense of power by humiliating another: <foreign lang="greek">ἀκολασία</foreign> does what it likes at the moment, without thinking of others. Aristotle distinguishes three <foreign lang="greek">εἴδη</foreign> of <foreign lang="greek">ὀλιγωρία</foreign> (slight esteem), &mdash; viz. <foreign lang="greek">καταφρόνησις</foreign> (contempt), <foreign lang="greek">ἐπηρεασμός</foreign> (active spite), <foreign lang="greek">ὕβρις</foreign>, outrage (<title>Rhet.</title> II. 2), &mdash; the point of <foreign lang="greek">ἐπηρεασμός</foreign> being that it <emph>vexes</emph> the other, and of <foreign lang="greek">ὕβρις</foreign> that it <emph>dishonours</emph> him. Arist. makes <foreign lang="greek">ἀκολασία</foreign> the <foreign lang="greek">ὑπερβολὴ περὶ ἡδονὰς καὶ λύπας</foreign>, &mdash; the <foreign lang="greek">μεσότης</foreign> being <foreign lang="greek">σωφροσύνη</foreign>. The accuser, in his reply, attributes <foreign lang="greek">ἀκολασία</foreign> to the youth (<foreign lang="greek">γ.</foreign> &sect; 6).
</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ἐν τῷ γυμνασίῳ</lemma> The <foreign lang="greek">παλαίστρα</foreign>, the school of wrestling and boxing, is often mentioned in connection with the <foreign lang="greek">διδασκαλεῖον</foreign> as a place of training for boys: cp. Theophr. <title>Char.</title> VII. The <foreign lang="greek">γυμνάσιον</foreign> was a more general resort, including grounds for running and archery, baths, and (as here) a range for javelin practice. Plato recommends that a boy should begin at six years of age to learn riding, and the us of the bow, javelin and sling: &lsquo;letters&rsquo; he postpones to the age of ten (<title>Legg.</title> VII. 794 C).
</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ἀκουσίους αἰτίας</lemma> &lsquo;charges arising from an involuntary act&rsquo;. A harsh phrase: but the conj. <foreign lang="greek">ἀνοσίους</foreign> seems weak.
</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">μὴ φονεῦσιν εἶναι</lemma> Notice the simple <foreign lang="greek">μή</foreign>, where <foreign lang="greek">μὴ οὐ</foreign> would be regular. Cp. <bibl n="Soph. Phil. 349">Soph. <title>Phil.</title> 349, <foreign lang="greek">οὐ πολὺν</foreign> &verbar; <foreign lang="greek">χρόνον μ’  ἐπέσχον μή με ναυστολεῖν ταχύ</foreign>. So <title>Trach.</title> 226. This is more frequent with <foreign lang="greek">τὸ μή</foreign>, e.g. </bibl><bibl n="Soph. OT 1387"><title>O. T.</title> 1387</bibl>: Xen. <title>Cyr.</title> v. 1. 25, <foreign lang="greek">τίς σοῦ ἀπελείφθη τὸ μή σοι ἀκολουθεῖν</foreign>; <bibl n="Hdt. 1.209">Her. I. 209</bibl>, <foreign lang="greek">οὐκ ὦν ἔστι μηχανὴ...οὐδεμία τὸ μὴ κεῖνον ἐπιβουλεύειν ἐμοί</foreign>.
</p></div3>
<div3 type="section" n="4">
<p>&lt;<lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ὁ μὲν ἐκωλύθη</lemma>&gt;] Cp. &sect; 7, <foreign lang="greek">ἔπαθε...διακωλυθεὶς τοῦ σκοποῦ τυχεῖν</foreign>. <pb n="205"/>
</p></div3>
<div3 type="section" n="5">
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">εἴπερ...ἀποθανών</lemma> &lsquo;As to the boy, if it has been proved to you that he was not struck while he stood still (<foreign lang="greek">ἑστώς</foreign>), it is still more manifest that, since he came of his own accord into the course of the javelin, he was killed through his own error&rsquo;. <foreign lang="greek">μή</foreign> and not <foreign lang="greek">οὐ</foreign> before <foreign lang="greek">βληθείς</foreign> because it depends on <foreign lang="greek">εἴπερ</foreign>: but <foreign lang="greek">οὐ</foreign> would have been admissible here, owing to the emphasis on the negative <emph>fact.</emph> Cp. on <title>De Caed. Her.</title> &sect; 14.  &mdash; <foreign lang="greek">ὑπελθὼν...δηλοῦται...ἀποθανών</foreign>. <gloss>Since</gloss>, or <gloss>because</gloss>, he came,... it is clear that he died: =<foreign lang="greek">τὸ ὑπελθεῖν αὐτὸν δηλοῖ ὅτι...ἀπέθανε</foreign>. So we might have, <foreign lang="greek">ἀμελήσας δῆλός ἐστιν ἁμαρτών</foreign>, &lsquo;it is clear that he erred <emph>by</emph> carelessness&rsquo;. The argument is: &lsquo;If he <emph>voluntarily</emph> left a <emph>safe</emph> place, he alone is answerable for the consequences&rsquo;. In <foreign lang="greek">ἔτι σαφεστέρως</foreign> the comparative is merely rhetorical: &mdash; It must be, if possible, more obvious still, etc. Note the alternative forms <foreign lang="greek">σαφεστέρως, σαφέστερον</foreign> (&sect; 6): cp. Isocr. <title>Panegyr.</title> &sect; 193.
</p></div3>
<div3 type="section" n="6">
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ὧν ἂν ἐπινοήσωσί τι δρᾶσαι</lemma> The proper construction would have been simply <foreign lang="greek">ἁμαρτάνοντες ὧν</foreign> (=<foreign lang="greek">τούτων ἅ</foreign>) <foreign lang="greek">ἂν ἐπινοήσωσι</foreign>, failing in the designs which they may have formed. But to this <foreign lang="greek">τι δρᾶσαι</foreign> is added, as if, instead of <foreign lang="greek">ἁμαρτάνοντες</foreign>, such a word as <foreign lang="greek">κωλυθέντες</foreign> had preceded: failing <gloss>to execute some part</gloss> of their designs. The redundancy was suggested by the antithesis between planning and doing: cp. <bibl n="Thuc. 5.13">Thuc. v. 13</bibl>, <foreign lang="greek">οὐκ ἀξιόχρεων αὐτῶν ὄντων δρᾶν τι ὧν κἀκεῖνος ἐπενόει</foreign>.

<div3 type="section" n="7">
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ἀπειρημένον...προστεταγμένον</lemma> Accus. absol.: <foreign lang="greek">προστεταγμένον</foreign> also in Plat. <title>Legg.</title> X. 902 D. So <foreign lang="greek">δέον  ἐξόν  παρέχον   παρασχόν  προσῆκον  εἰρημένον  δεδογμένον  γεγραμμένον   προσταχθέν, κ.τ.λ.</foreign> Goodwin &sect; 110. 2.
</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ἐξεμελέτα</lemma> &lsquo;was carefully practising&rsquo;. Plat. <title>Hipp. mai.</title> 286 D, <foreign lang="greek">ἀκούσας καὶ μαθὼν καὶ ἐκμελετήσας</foreign> (having perfected my skill) <foreign lang="greek">πάλιν ἰέναι ἐπὶ τὸν ἐρωτήσαντα</foreign>.
</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ἐν γυμναζομένοις</lemma> i.e. not among those who were practising athletic exercises (where the risk of an ccident would have been greater), but &lsquo;in the rank&rsquo; (<foreign lang="greek">τάξις</foreign>) of the javelin-throwers, who had a special part of the gymnasium reserved for them.
</p></div3>
<div3 type="section" n="8">

III. 67</bibl>, <foreign lang="greek">τετιμωρημένοι</foreign>, &lsquo;having taken vengeance&rsquo;: but in <bibl n="Thuc. 7.77">Thuc. VII. 77</bibl> it is passive, <foreign lang="greek">ἀποχρώντως ἤδη τετιμωρήμεθα</foreign>, &lsquo;we have been punished&rsquo;: and so VI. 60, <foreign lang="greek">ἐτετιμώρηντο</foreign>. So e.g. <foreign lang="greek">μεμιμημένος, ἐντεθυμημένος, ἐσκεμμένος, ᾐτιαμένος, κεκτημένος</foreign>, can be either midd. or pass.
</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">οὐ συνηδομένων οὐδὲ συνεθ</lemma> The use of <foreign lang="greek">συν-</foreign> in the first pair of compounds is incorrect: the meaning is, <foreign lang="greek">οὐκ ἐπιχαιρόντων οὐδ’  ἐθελόντων</foreign>: but the form of the first clause is assimilated to that of the second. Cp. <bibl n="Thuc. 1.142">Thuc.

</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">τῶν ἐπιτηδευμάτων</lemma> &lsquo;our aims in life&rsquo;. Cp. &sect; 3, <foreign lang="greek">ταῦτα παιδεύων τὸν υἱὸν ἐξ ὧν μάλιστα τὸ κοινὸν ὠφελεῖται.  ἐπιτήδευμα</foreign>, a practice founded on a principle, <bibl n="Thuc. 1.32">Thuc. I. 32</bibl>, 37.

This is characteristic of the <title>Tetralogies</title> (cp. <foreign lang="greek">β.</foreign> &sect; 2 and <foreign lang="greek">γ.  3, εἰς τὸν ὑμέτερον ἔλεον καταπεφευγώς</foreign>), which are repertories of points and topics, not examples of finished form.

<p> &mdash; An elderly man having died of blows received in a quarrel, the youth who had dealt them is accused of murder before the Areiopagus. The accuser's first address expresses in a striking form the religious view of homicide as a defilement. See <bibl n="Jebb Orators 3.4"><title>Attic Orators</title>, I. 55</bibl>.

<head><foreign lang="greek">Περὶ τοῦ Ἡρῶδου φόνου</foreign></head>
<p>Herodes, an Athenian citizen, had settled at Mytilene in 424 B.C., after the <pb n="208"/> revolt and reduction of that town. He was one of the cleruchs among whom its territory was apportioned, but not otherwise wealthy. Having occasion to make a voyage to Aenos on the coast of Thrace, to receive the ransom of some Thracian captives who were in his hands, he sailed from Mytilene with the accused, &mdash; a young man whose father, a citizen of Mytilene, lived chiefly at Aenos. Herodes and his companion were driven by a storm to put in at Methymna on the north-west coast of Lesbos; and there, as the weather was wet, exchanged their open vessel for another which was decked. After they had been drinking on board together, Herodes went ashore at night, and was never seen again.
</p>
<p>The accused, after making every inquiry for him, went on to Aenos in the open vessel; while the decked vessel, into which they had moved at Methymna, returned to Mytilene. On reaching the latter place again, the defendant was charged by the relatives of Herodes with having murdered him at the instigation of Lyc&icirc;nus, an Athenian living at Mytilene, who had been on bad terms with the deceased. They rested their charge principally on three grounds. First, that the sole companion of the missing man must naturally be considered accountable for his disappearance. Secondly, that a slave had confessed under torture to having assisted the defendant in the murder. Thirdly, that on board the vessel which returned from Methymna had been found a letter in which the defendant announced to Lyc&icirc;nus the accomplishment of the murder.
</p>
<p>It was necessary that the trial should take place at Athens, whither all subject-allies were compelled to bring their criminal causes. The ordinary course would have been to have laid an indictment for murder (<foreign lang="greek">γραφὴ φόνου</foreign>) before the Areiopagus. Instead, however, of doing this the relatives of Herodes laid an information against the accused as a &lsquo;malefactor&rsquo; (<foreign lang="greek">κακοῦργος</foreign>). He was accordingly to be tried by an ordinary dikastery under the presidency of the Eleven. &lsquo;Malefactor&rsquo;, at Athens, ordinarily meant a thief, a housebreaker, a kidnapper, or criminal of the like class; but the term was, of course, applicable to murder, especially if accompanied by robbery. Date about 417 B.C. See <bibl n="Jebb Orators 3.4"><title>Attic Orators</title>, I. 55</bibl> ff.

<p>] The speech On the Choreutes relates to the death of Diodotus, a boy who was in training as member of a chorus to be produced at the Thargelia, and who was poisoned by a draught given to him to improve <pb n="218"/> his voice. The accused is the choregus, an Athenian citizen, who discharged that office for his own and another trible, and at whose house the chorus received their lessons. The accuser, Philocrates, brother of the deceased Diodotus, laid an information for poisoning before the Archon Basileus; and, after some delay, the case came before the Areiopagus. It was not contended that the accused had intended to murder the boy, but only that he had ordered to be administered to him the draught which caused his death. According to Athenian law this was, however, a capital offence. The present speech is the second made by the defendant, and the last, therefore, of the trial. Its date may probably be placed about 412 B.C.: see <bibl n="Jebb Orators 3.5"><title>Attic Orators</title>, I. 62</bibl>. &mdash; A short extract is given here as illustrating the greater ease and freedom of Antiphon's later style, which is already beginning to emancipate itself from the stiffness of the <foreign lang="greek">αὐστηρὰ ἁρμονία</foreign>.

<p>ANDOCIDES: born about 440 B.C.: died later than 390 B.C.  Approximate period of extant work, 410 &mdash; 390 B.C. <title>Life</title> in <bibl n="Jebb Orators 4.1"><title>Attic Orators</title>, I. 71</bibl> &mdash; 87.
</p>
<p>Style. Andocides is less a rhetorical artist than a vigorous speaker of quick native wit. The ancient criticism of oratory tended to regard it too much from the reader's point of view, and too little from the hearer's. This was unfavourable to Andocides. He is declared by Hermogenes (170 A.D. <foreign lang="greek">περὶ ἰδ</foreign>. B. xi.) to be wanting in the distinctive excellences of practical oratory, deliberative and forensic. His diction is plain (<foreign lang="greek">ἀφελής</foreign>), though not with the studied plainness of Lysias. He is sparing in the use of the rhetorical figures <hi rend="ital">of language</hi> (<foreign lang="greek">σχήματα λέξεως</foreign>), such as antithesis, parallelism between the forms of the two sentences (<foreign lang="greek">παρίσωσις</foreign>), or assonance (<foreign lang="greek">παρομοίωσις</foreign>): though he uses largely the figures <hi rend="ital">of thought</hi> (<foreign lang="greek">σχήματα</foreign> <pb n="220"/> <foreign lang="greek">διανοίας</foreign>), such as rhetorical question. In the arrangement of subject-matter he is simple and inartificial (<foreign lang="greek">ἁπλοῦς  ἀκατάσκευος</foreign>). His strength lies in narrative, diversified by anecdote and enlivened by graphic description &mdash; sometimes by touches of true dramatic power. In addition to these literary merits, his speeches are of great historical value for the years 415 &mdash;  390 B.C. &mdash; See <bibl n="Jebb Orators 5.1"><title>Attic Orators</title>, I. 88</bibl> &mdash; 108.

<head><foreign lang="greek">Περὶ τῆς ἑαυτοῦ καθόδου</foreign></head>
<p>] Spoken before the Athenian Ecclesia not later than the summer of 410 B.C. [See <bibl n="Jebb Orators 6.1"><title>Attic Orators</title>, I. 109</bibl>. Andoc. lays stress on the service which he has rendered to Athens by securing a supply of corn from Cyprus: but the battle of Cyzicus in 410 B.C. was followed by the re-opening of the corn-trade between the Euxine and Athens: Xen. <title>H.</title> I. 1. 35. The benefit for which Andoc. claims credit would have been of little importance had it been conferred later than the middle of the year 410.] The object of the speech is to procure the removal of certain disabilities under which he was alleged to lie. His disclosures in 415 B.C. were made under a guarantee of immunity from penalties. But the decree of Isotimides, passed soon afterwards, excluded from the market-place and from temples all &lsquo;who had committed impiety and who had confessed it&rsquo;; and his enemies maintained that this decree applied to him. The appeal was unsuccessful. He returned to Athens only after the general amnesty of 403 B.C. Having first deprecated the resentment felt against him for having denounced the mutilators of the Hermae in 415 B.C. (&sect;&sect; 1 &mdash; 9), he proceeds, in the following passage, to speak of his life in exile &mdash; his services to the army at Samos in 411 B.C. &mdash; his return to Athens during the rule of the Four Hundred &mdash; and his imprisonment at the instance of Peisander.

<p>Andocides had returned to Athens under the amnesty of 403 B.C.

<p>III. <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ΠΕΡΙ ΤΗΣ ΠΡΟΣ ΛΑΚΕΔΑΙΜΟΝΙΟΥΣ ΕΙΡΗΝΗΣ</lemma>. &mdash; The speech On the Peace with Lacedaemon belongs to 390 B.C., the fourth year of the Corinthian War. Athens, Boeotia, Corinth and Argos were at this time allied against Sparta. The success of Agesilaus in 391 had led the Athenians, probably in the winter of 391 &mdash; 90 B.C., to send plenipotentiaries, among whom was Andocides, to treat for peace at Sparta. According to the terms proposed by the Lacedaemonians, Athens was to retain her Long Walls &mdash;  rebuilt three years before by Conon &mdash; and her fleet; she was also to recover Lemnos, Imbros and Scyros: and Boeotia was to be gratified by the withdrawal of the Spartan garrison from Orchomenus. The plenipotentiaries did not use their powers, but requested that the Athenian ecclesia might have forty days in which to consider these proposals; and returned, accompanied by Spartan envoys, to Athens. It was in the ensuing debate &mdash; early in the year 390 &mdash; that the speech of Andocides was made. &mdash; <bibl n="Jebb Orators 4.6"><title>Attic Orators</title>, I. 83</bibl>. The genuineness of the speech has been questioned, but without sufficient reason. One passage of it (&sect;&sect; 3 &mdash; 12) was adopted, with slight modifications, by Aeschines (<title>De Fals. Legat.</title> &sect;&sect; 172 &mdash; 176). See <bibl n="Jebb Orators 6.3.1"><title>Attic Orators</title>, I. 129</bibl>.
</p>
<p>Andoc. first shows that a peace with Sparta is not a danger to the Athenian democracy (&sect;&sect; 1 &mdash; 12). He then argues that there is no good reason for continuing the war, and that the proposed terms are peculiarly advantageous to Athens (&sect;&sect; 13 &mdash;  23). If the Boeotians make peace on their own account, Athens will be left with one weak ally, Corinth, and another of which the policy is thoroughly selfish &mdash; Argos (&sect;&sect; 24 &mdash; 27).

<head>Lysias</head>
<p>LYSIAS: born 459 B.C. acc. to Dionysius and the Plutarchic  Life: between 444 and 436 B.C. acc. to K. F. Hermann, etc.: died later than 380 B.C. Approximate period of extant work, 403 &mdash; 380 B.C. <title>Life</title> in <bibl n="Jebb Orators 7.1"><title>Attic Orators</title>, I. 142</bibl> &mdash; 157.
</p>
<p>Style. Lysias takes up the development of Attic prose at a point where the stiffness of the older rhetoric, as seen in Antiphon's work, had been modified, but no perfect reconciliation had yet been effected between literary finish and the Attic idiom of ordinary life. Lysias achieves this reconciliation. Unlike Antiphon before him and Isocrates after him, he has the art of concealing his art. His distinctive qualities are a delicate mastery of the purest Attic, a subtle power of expressing character, a restrained sense of humour, and a certain flexibility of mind which enables him under the most diverse circumstances to write with almost unfailing tact and charm, &mdash;  with that <foreign lang="greek">χάρις</foreign>, hardly to be analysed save in so far as felicity of expression and an essential urbanity are implied in it, which the old critics felt in him. <pb n="236"/>
</p>
<p>Technically, Lysias represents the &lsquo;plain&rsquo; manner as distinguished from the &lsquo;stately&rsquo; and the &lsquo;middle&rsquo;: (<foreign lang="greek">ἰσχνὸς χαρακτήρ, λιτή</foreign> or <foreign lang="greek">ἀφελὴς λέξις</foreign>, opp. to <foreign lang="greek">μεγαλοπρεπής</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">μέση</foreign>:  <cit><bibl n="Cic. Orat. 6.20">Cic. <title>or.</title> 6. &sect; 20</bibl> <quote lang="la">grandiloqui &mdash; tenues &mdash; medius et quasi temperatus.</quote></cit>) His <hi rend="ital">composition</hi> (<foreign lang="greek">σύνθεσις</foreign>) varies with the subject and the occasion. In the first of the following extracts, for example, the <foreign lang="greek">Ὀλυμπιακός</foreign>, we find elaborate and artistic periods. In the fifth extract &mdash; from the <foreign lang="greek">κατὰ Ἐρατοσθένους</foreign>, where the public and private characters are combined &mdash; the periodic structure is blended with a style of greater ease and simplicity. In the last extract, the <foreign lang="greek">κατὰ Παγκλέωνος</foreign>, the manner of the composition is throughout of a simpler kind. The <hi rend="ital">diction</hi> (<foreign lang="greek">λέξις</foreign>) of Lysias is marked by a general avoidance of words or phrases foreign to the ordinary idiom of the day; by abstinence from rhetorical figures, except such as consist in the parallelism or opposition of clauses; and by the union of clearness with conciseness. His power of delineating character (<foreign lang="greek">ἠθοποιία</foreign>) is illustrated by the speech <foreign lang="greek">ὑπὲρ Μαντιθέου</foreign>, our third extract: his power of vivid description (<foreign lang="greek">ἐνάργεια</foreign>) will be seen in the speeches against Eratosthenes and Agoratus. The <hi rend="ital">arrangement</hi> (<foreign lang="greek">τάξις</foreign>) of subject-matter is nearly always simple: &mdash; proem &mdash;  narrative &mdash; proof &mdash; epilogue. &mdash; See <bibl n="Jebb Orators 8.1"><title>Attic Orators</title>, I. 158</bibl> &mdash; 198.

<p>. [Or. XXXIII.] &mdash; This is a fragment &mdash;  probably the greater part &mdash; of an oration delivered by Lysias at Olympia. The great panhellenic festivals afforded an appropriate opportunity to poets and orators who desired to speak, not of those interests or glories which belonged to a single city, but of those which were common to Greece. The ancient Greeks, although they never formed a nation, had a national sentiment, founded on community of blood, speech and manners: and this sentiment was probably never called forth more vividly than when Greeks of all cities came together at Nemea or at the Isthmus, at Delphi or at Olympia.
</p>
<p>Hippias, we are told, <foreign lang="greek">ἔθελγε τὴν Ἑλλάδα ἐν Ὀλυμπίᾳ λόγοις ποικίλοις καὶ πεφροντισμένοις εὖ</foreign>, &lsquo;used to charm Greece at Olympia with ornate and carefully meditated speeches&rsquo; (Philostr. I. 11). The <foreign lang="greek">Ὀλυμπικός</foreign> of Gorgias &lsquo;dealt with the largest of political questions. Seeing Greece torn by faction, he became a counsellor of concord, seeking to turn the Greeks against the barbarians, and advising them to take the land of the <pb n="237"/> aliens &mdash; not each others' cities &mdash; for the prize of their arms&rsquo; (ib.).
</p>
<p>The <title>Olympiacus</title> of Lysias was spoken, according to Diodorus, in the first year of the 98th Olympiad, 388 B.C. &mdash; the year before the Peace of Antalcidas, by which the Corinthian War was brought to a close. Athens, Thebes, Argos and Corinth had then been seven years at war with Sparta. During this time two powers, both dangerous to the freedom of Greece, had been rapidly growing. In the east the naval strength of Persia had become greater than it had been for a century. In the west Dionysius I., tyrant of Syracuse, had reduced Naxos, Catana and Leontini: had twice defeated Carthage; and was threatening the Greek towns of Italy. A magnificent embassy from the court of Dionysius, with his brother Thearides at its head, appeared at the Olympic festival of 388 B.C. Tents embroidered with gold were pitched in the sacred enclosure; a number of splendid chariots were entered in the name of Dionysius for the four-horse chariotrace; while rhapsodists, whose skill in recitation attracted crowds, repeated poems composed by their royal master. While eye and ear were thus allured by the glories of the Syracusan tyrant, Lysias lifted up his voice to remind the assembled Greeks that in Dionysius they must recognise one of the two great enemies of Greece. Let them not admit to their sacred festival the representatives of an impious despotism. Let them remember that their duty is to overthrow that tyranny and to set Sicily free; and let the war be begun forthwith by an attack upon those glittering tents. &mdash; <bibl n="Jebb Orators 9.2.1"><title>Attic Orators</title>, I. 203</bibl> f.

When, after the fall of the Thirty, the Democracy was restored in 403 B.C., it was the aim of Sparta to restrict it. One Phormisios proposed in the Ecclesia that only land-owners should have the franchise, a measure which, according to Dionysius, would have excluded about five thousand citizens. The speech from which he gives an extract was made against this motion during a debate in the Ecclesia.

The complaint against him was that his name appeared on the list (<foreign lang="greek">σανίδιον</foreign>, &sect; 6) of those who had served as Knights in the time of the Thirty. As or. XXVI. against Evandrus shows (&sect; 10), the fact of such service under the Tyrants became, after the restoration of the Democracy, a disqualification for the office of senator. Mantitheus must, then, have been at least eighteen years of age in 405 B.C., and so must have been born before 422. He refers to his share in campaigns subsequent to that of 394 B.C. (&sect;&sect; 15 &mdash;  18). On the other hand, the tone of &sect; 15 rather suggests that Thrasybulus was still alive; &mdash; that is, that the speech is earlier than 389 B.C. The date may have been about 392 B.C. The speaker, who was taunted with youthful presumption (&sect; 20), cannot have been much more than thirty. &mdash; <bibl n="Jebb Orators 10.5.1"><title>Attic Orators</title>, I. 245</bibl>.

In this speech Lysias, himself the speaker, charges Eratosthenes with the murder of Polemarchus, and, generally, with his share in the Tyranny. A special clause in the Amnesty of 403 B.C. excluded the Thirty Tyrants, the Ten who had succeeded them, and the Eleven who had executed their sentences. But any one even of these might enjoy the Amnesty if he chose to stand a public inquiry, and was acquitted. When the oligarchy was finally overthrown, Pheidon and Eratosthenes were the only members of it who stayed at Athens. As they dared to do this, they must have availed themselves of the permission to give account of their office. Here, then, we have not to do with an ordinary indictment for murder (<foreign lang="greek">γραφὴ φόνου</foreign>). The public inquiry into the conduct of Eratosthenes afforded Lysias the opportunity for preferring his accusation. This is indicated (1) by the wide range of topics in the speech, dealing, as it does, with the whole history of the Anarchy: (2) by &sect; 37, where the accuser says that he has done enough in having shown that the guilt of the accused reaches the point at which death is deserved: which he could scarcely have said if (as in a <foreign lang="greek">γραφὴ φόνου</foreign>) death had been the <hi rend="ital">necessary</hi> penalty in case of conviction.

Personal enmity (<foreign lang="greek">ἔχθρα</foreign>) was regarded as a proof that the accuser was in grim earnest, &mdash; that he was not a mere busy-body (<foreign lang="greek">πολυπράγμων</foreign>) or mercenary calumniator (<foreign lang="greek">συκοφάντης</foreign>).

(2) <foreign lang="greek">εὔνους</foreign> being, then, accus. plur., the words would mean, &lsquo;thought that you were friendly&rsquo;. But the sense wanted is, &lsquo;thought that you ought to be much obliged to them&rsquo;. This sense would be obtained if we adopted Dobree's suggestion, and read <foreign lang="greek">εὔνους ᾤοντο &lt;δεῖν&gt; εἶναι</foreign>.

<p>. [Or. XIII.] &mdash; Agoratus, son of a  slave, had gained the Athenian citizenship by pretending (falsely, his accuser says) to have had a hand in the assassination of Phrynichus in 411 B.C. (&sect; 76.) For six years afterwards he had lived at Athens, exercising the trade of an informer, and laying &lsquo;all conceivable indictments&rsquo; (<foreign lang="greek">τὰς ἐξ ἀνθρώπων γραφάς</foreign>, &sect; 73) before the law-courts. He is now charged with having slandered away the lives of several distinguished citizens just before the establishment of the Thirty.
</p>
<p>It was in the spring of 404 B.C. that Theramenes came back from Sparta with the hard conditions of peace. Athens had been suffering for months the extreme of famine and misery; <pb n="260"/> the mass of citizens were thankful for relief on any terms. But there were still a few men, influential by their position and services, who stood out against the bargain which the oligarchical party were about to strike with Sparta. The oligarchs, impatient to get rid of their opponents, had recourse to the aid of Agoratus. It was arranged that he should himself be charged with plotting to defeat the peace, and should then denounce a certain number of other persons as his accomplices. One Theocritus accused him before the Senate. A party of Senators went to the Peiraeus to arrest him. Agoratus, feigning alarm, took sanctuary at the altar in the temple of Artemis at Munychia. Certain citizens who suspected him to be the victim, or the agent, of a plot, gave bail for him, and offered to take him out of Attica to await quieter times. He declined this proposal, and appeared before the Senate to give information. He denounced, first, the men who had bailed him; then several of the Generals and taxiarchs (&sect; 13), among whom were the General Strombichides, Dionysodorus (kinsman of the accuser in this case), and probably Eucrates the brother of Nicias; also a number of other citizens. These, with Agoratus himself, were imprisoned; and it was decreed that they should be tried both by the Senate and by a special court of Two Thousand. Immediately afterwards the peace with Sparta was ratified.
</p>
<p>The government of the Thirty having been established, the prisoners were tried; but not by the Two Thousand; only by a new oligarchical Senate. They were all condemned to death, except Agoratus, who was banished. In 404 B.C. he joined the democratic exiles at Phyl&egrave;, and afterwards returned to Athens with them; but appears to have been ill received (&sect; 77). He is now accused of murder by Dionysius, cousin and brother-in-law to Dionysodorus.

<p>. [Or. VII.] &mdash; &lsquo;On the Sacred Olive&rsquo;. The man for whom this defence was written &mdash; a rich Athenian citizen (&sect;&sect; 21, 31) &mdash; had originally been charged with destroying a <hi rend="ital">moria</hi>, or sacred olive, on a farm which belonged to him. As to do this was a fraud upon the Treasury, the <pb n="269"/> form of the original accusation had been an apograph&egrave; (<foreign lang="greek">ἀπεγράφην</foreign>, &sect; 2). But the charge was not supported by the persons who had rented from the State the produce of the moriae on this farm (<foreign lang="greek">οἱ ἐωνημένοι τοὺς καρποὺς τῶν μοριῶν</foreign>, &sect; 2). The accusers had therefore changed their ground. They now charge the defendant merely with uprooting the <hi rend="ital">fenced-in stump</hi> (<foreign lang="greek">σηκός</foreign>) of a moria; and they lay against him an indictment for impiety. The chief accuser is one Nicomachus.
</p>
<p>Throughout Attica, besides the olives which were private property (<foreign lang="greek">ἴδιαι ἐλαῖαι</foreign>, &sect; 10), there were others which, whether growing on public or on private lands, were considered as the property of the State. These were called <hi rend="ital">moriae</hi> (<foreign lang="greek">μορίαι</foreign>) &mdash; the legend being that they had been propagated (<foreign lang="greek">μεμορημέναι</foreign>) from the original olive which Athene herself had caused to spring up on the Acropolis. This theory was convenient for their conservation as State property, since, by giving them a sacred character, it placed them directly under the care of the Areiopagus, which caused them to be visited once a month by Inspectors (<foreign lang="greek">ἐπιμεληταί</foreign>, &sect; 29), and once a year by special Commissioners (<foreign lang="greek">γνώμονες</foreign>, &sect; 25). To uproot a <hi rend="ital">moria</hi> was an offence punishable by banishment and confiscation of goods (&sect; 41).
</p>
<p>The case is tried by the Areiopagus under the presidency of the Archon Basileus. The offence was alleged to have been committed in the archonship of Suniades (&sect; 11), Ol. 95. 4, 397 B.C. To judge from &sect; 42 (<foreign lang="greek">τοσούτῳ χρόνῳ ὕστερον</foreign>) the trial took place not earlier than 395 B.C.; probably later. &mdash; <bibl n="Jebb Orators 10.8.2"><title>Attic Orators</title>, I. 289</bibl>.

This plea (<foreign lang="greek">παραγραφή</foreign>) gave rise to a previous trial to decide whether the action, in its original form, could be brought into court (&sect; 5).

<p>ISOCRATES: 436 &mdash; 338 B.C. Period of extant work, 403 &mdash;   338 B.C. <title>Life</title> in <bibl n="Jebb Orators 12.1"><title>Attic Orators</title>, II. 1</bibl> &mdash; 34.
</p>
<p>Style. The work of Isocrates was to establish a standard type of literary rhetorical prose. His discourses were meant to be read rather than to be spoken. This is one essential characteristic which distinguishes them from the compositions of the other Attic orators. Isocrates is properly an &lsquo;orator&rsquo; only in his forensic speeches, the earliest, and in his own view the least significant, of his writings. In his later life he altogether repudiated Forensic Rhetoric; on the other hand, &lsquo;want of voice and nerve&rsquo;, as he tells us, deterred him from taking part in the debates of the Ecclesia. The real work of his life was twofold. First, he was an educator, the head of a school which became renowned &mdash; teaching young men the art which he calls <foreign lang="greek">ἡ τῶν λόγων παιδεία</foreign>, the discipline of discourse &mdash; meaning by this, the art of speaking and writing on large political subjects, considered as a preparation for advising or acting in political affairs. (Cp. <title>Attic Orators</title>, II. ch. XIII. on his <foreign lang="greek">φιλοσοφία</foreign>, or theory of culture.) Secondly, he was a political essayist. In this quality &mdash; his writings being widely read throughout Greece &mdash; he had perhaps a greater influence on popular opinion than belonged to any literary man of his time. The style of literary prose which he developed had found general acceptance before 350 B.C.; through Greek teachers who gave it a more florid colour, it did much to mould the style of Cicero, who speaks of himself as using &lsquo;all the fragrant essences of Isocrates, and all the little stores of his disciples&rsquo; (<hi rend="ital">ad Att.</hi> II. 1); and through Cicero, or directly, it has exerted an influence on modern literature. It has been truly remarked that, for the modern world, the oratory of the preacher is the best image of that grave eloquence in which Isocrates excelled. Isocrates is one of three Greek writers &mdash;  Plato and Demosthenes being the others &mdash; to whom Bossuet declares himself most indebted in the matter of style.
</p>
<p>Isocrates has not the distinctively Attic spirit, the subtle grace or finished simplicity of Lysias. His <hi rend="ital">diction</hi>, indeed, resembles that of Lysias in purity, and also &mdash; though it has a general bent towards grandeur &mdash; in avoiding ornament of a poetical kind. But his <hi rend="ital">composition</hi> is of an altogether different stamp. Instead of aiming at the vigorous compression fittest for real contests, it has a certain rich diffuseness. Dionysius speaks of the <foreign lang="greek">ὑπαγωγικὴ περίοδος</foreign>, the &lsquo;meandering&rsquo; periods of Isocr. &mdash; having in his mind such an image as that of a river which leads us on from bend to bend through the <pb n="282"/> soft beauties of its winding course. Isocrates was the first great artist in a Greek prose which, without being bound by the constraints of <hi rend="ital">metre</hi> (<foreign lang="greek">ἔμμετρος</foreign>), has yet a free <hi rend="ital">rhythm</hi> of its own (<foreign lang="greek">εὐρύθμως καὶ μουσικῶς εἰπεῖν</foreign>, <title>Adv. Soph.</title> &sect; 16, p. 115). The peculiar <hi rend="ital">smoothness</hi> of Isocr. results esp. from his careful observance of his own rule, <foreign lang="greek">δεῖ τὰ φωνήεντα μὴ συμπίπτειν</foreign>, i.e. a vowel at the end of a word must not be followed by a vowel at the beginning of the next. Plutarch speaks of Isocr. as <foreign lang="greek">ὁ φοβούμενος φωνῆεν φωνήεντι συγκροῦσαι</foreign> (<title>De Glor. Athen.</title> c. 8). Demosthenes did not press this rule so far (<bibl n="Jebb Orators 14.8"><title>Attic Orators</title>, II. 67</bibl>). The figures (<foreign lang="greek">σχήματα</foreign>) specially used by Isocr. are those which depend on parallelism: viz. (1) <foreign lang="greek">ἀντίθεσις</foreign> &mdash; a parallelism in sense: (2) <foreign lang="greek">παρίσωσις</foreign>, a parallelism in form between two clauses or sentences: (3) <foreign lang="greek">παρομοίωσις</foreign>, a parallelism of sound, when the latter of two clauses gives an echo of the former, either at its opening or at its close, or throughout. The same antithetical bent appears in Isocr.'s treatment of subject-matter, where his habit is to work out a leading idea by developing all the contrasts which it suggests. Thus the subject of the <title>Panegyricus</title> is a Greek war with Persia. Greece is dealt with in the first part, Persia in the second: in part I., again, Athens is contrasted with Sparta: the services of Athens to Greece are divided into the civil and the military, &mdash;  the latter being classed as in wars between Greeks or in wars between Greek and barbarian: part II. shows that Persia is open to attack, while Greece has every motive for attacking.
</p>
<p>Isocrates marks the moment at which the purest Attic prose begins to pass over into an artificial literary prose of greater richness, but with less of spiritual grace and delicate precision. In this respect his literary style corresponds to his intellectual position. He belongs to the latter days of free Hellenic life, and while he has the political exclusiveness of a true Hellene, is already able to conceive that men not Hellenic in blood should come to share in Hellenic culture &mdash; a conception which, in the generation after his own, began to be realised by the civilisation of Hellenism. This has been well brought out by Curtius (<title>Hist. Greece</title> v. 116, 204). &lsquo;Athens&rsquo;, says Isocr., &lsquo;has so distanced the rest of the world in power of thought and speech that her disciples have become the teachers of all other men. She has brought it to pass that the name of Greek should be thought no longer a matter of race but a matter of intelligence; and should be given to the participators in our culture rather than to the sharers of our common origin&rsquo;: <title>Panegyr.</title> &sect; 50. &mdash; See <bibl n="Jebb Orators 12.11"><title>Attic Orators</title>, II. 16</bibl>; 54 &mdash; 79: 425 f.

<head><foreign lang="greek">Νικόκλης ἤ Κύπριοι</foreign></head>
<p>[Or. III.] &mdash; Nicocles succeeded his father Evagoras as king of the Cyprian Salamis in 374 B.C. The discourse of Isocrates entitled <foreign lang="greek">Πρὸς Νικοκλέα</foreign> (or. II.) was addressed to the young king soon after his accession. It is a series of precepts on the duty of a ruler to his subjects. The <foreign lang="greek">Νικοκλῆς ἢ Κύπριοι</foreign> is a companion piece to the former. Here it is Nicocles who is supposed to speak, and who instructs his Salaminian subjects in their duties towards their king. Since the prince can appeal to his people's past experience of his rule (&sect; 63), the date can hardly be earlier than 372 B.C.: on the other hand it cannot be later than 355 B.C., and may probably be placed between 372 and 365 B.C.
</p>
<p>In the following passage the king urges the advantages of a Monarchy as compared with an Oligarchy or a Republic. Here Isocrates is essentially the professional rhetor &mdash; it being distinctive of Rhetoric that, like its counterpart Dialectic, it is equally ready to argue either side of a question (<foreign lang="greek">τἀναντία συλλογίζεται</foreign>, Ar. <title>Rhet.</title> I. 1). Isocrates has given the other side in his <foreign lang="greek">Ἀρεοπαγιτικός</foreign> (p. 151) as well as in the <title>Panathenaicus</title>, where he interprets his own political ideal, &mdash; a Democracy tempered by a censorship. &mdash; <bibl n="Jebb Orators 15.4.1"><title>Attic Orators</title>, II. 87</bibl>, 90 f.
</p>
<p>The advantages claimed for Monarchy, it will be seen, are briefly these: (1) it discriminates merit, &sect;&sect; 14, 15: (2) it has more insight into the natures and actions of men: (3) it is the mildest of governments, &sect; 16: (4) its ministers learn and perform their duties more thoroughly, &sect;&sect; 17, 18: (5) it is prompt in action, &sect; 19: (6) it has fewer jealousies, &sect; 20: (7) it has a more direct interest in good government, &sect; 21: (8) it is more effective in war, &sect; 22. &mdash; As a plea for monarchy by the citizen of a Greek Republic, compare the brief speech invented by Herod. for Dareius in the debate of the Persian conspirators, III. 82. <pb n="284"/>

<p>. [Or. X.] &mdash; The <title>Encomium on Helen</title> (like another of his works, the <title>Busiris</title>, or. XI.) is a slight essay by Isocr. in a province not his own. Declamations on subjects taken from epos or from the myths had always a prominent place among the &lsquo;displays&rsquo; of ordinary Sophists. Such, for instance, are the <title>Encomium on Helen</title> and the <title>Defence of Palamedes</title> ascribed to Gorgias; the speech of Odysseus <title>Against Palamedes</title> ascribed to Alcidamas; the speeches of Ajax and Odysseus in the contest for the arms, ascribed to Antisthenes. The bent of Isocrates, as he himself tells us, was not towards this kind of composition. He was not, indeed, hostile to it, any more than he was hostile to criticism <pb n="288"/> of the poets and other branches of literary work which employed the Sophists. The encomia which he depreciates in or. X. &sect; 12 are encomia on bumble-bees and salt; on the other hand he expressly commends the choice of such a subject as Helen (&sect; 14); and if he speaks of Busiris as a poor theme (or. XI. &sect; 22), he clearly means only that it is one which baffles the panegyrist. Yet it is important to note that he comes upon this field of &lsquo;display&rsquo; not as a candidate for distinction, but merely as a critic. The <title>Busiris</title> and the <title>Encomium on Helen</title> are alike criticisms, in which he first reviews the work of others, and then shows, for the sake of vindicating his right to criticise, how he would have done the work himself.
</p>
<p>Two indications help to fix the time at which Isocrates wrote. 1. From &sect; 3 it may be inferred that Gorgias was dead; and Gorgias died about 380 B.C. 2. In &sect; 1 there is an allusion to the three chief Socratic sects &mdash; the Cynics, the Academy, the Megarics. These sects must have already been mature. The language implies further that Antisthenes, founder of the Cynics &mdash; who died in 376 B.C. &mdash; is still alive. The <title>Encomium</title> may probably be put about 370 B.C. &mdash; <bibl n="Jebb Orators 15.4.3"><title>Attic Orators</title>, II. 93</bibl>, 102.

<p>. [Or. IX.] &mdash; On the occasion of a festival held by Nicocles, king of the Cyprian Salamis (cp. introd. to or. III., p. 283), in memory of his father Evagoras (who died in 374 B.C.), Isocrates sent this encomium as his tribute. The date is probably about 365 B.C.
</p>
<p>Evagoras appears to have been a man of unusually strong character, and of great abilities both military and political. Cyprus was divided between Phoenician settlements, such as Citium and Paphos, and later Greek settlements, such as Salamis and Soli. But the bulk of the population was, till long after the time of Evagoras, Phoenician; and continual contact with the non-hellenic East must always have tended to depress the Greek element in Cyprus. Evagoras was the champion of Hellenism against barbarism at this out-post; first, as restorer of that Greek civilisation which the Phoenician and Tyrian masters of Salamis had effaced; afterwards, as antagonist of Persia in a War of Independence. Perhaps the most striking passage in the memoir is the following, which describes how commerce, arts, letters, humane intercourse with the outer world, having become extinct under the rule of the barbarian, speedily sprang into a new life under the rule of the Hellene. &mdash; <bibl n="Jebb Orators 15.5.3"><title>Attic Orators</title>, II. 113</bibl>.

<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">παραλαβὼν τὴν πόλιν ἐκβ</lemma> &lsquo;When the city (Salamis) came into his hands, it had been reduced to barbarism; owing <pb n="290"/> to the domination of the Phoenicians, it had no intercourse with Greeks, no knowledge of the useful arts, no commerce, no harbour: but he supplied all these deficiencies&rsquo;, etc.
</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">διὰ τὴν τῶν Φοινίκων ἀρχ</lemma> The earliest Greek immigrants into Cyprus seem to have found Phoenicians already established. The Greek settlements traced their origin to Athens, Salamis, Arcadia, Cythnus (one of the Cyclades): <bibl n="Hdt. 7.90">Her. VII. 90</bibl>. Long after the time at which Isocrates is writing the Phoenician element in Cyprus greatly preponderated over the Hellenic: thus Scylax in his <foreign lang="greek">Περίπλους</foreign>, p. 97 (written in the time of Philip of Macedon, 359 &mdash; 336 B.C.), calls the inhabitants of the interior collectively &lsquo;barbarians&rsquo;. Of the Greek cities on the coast, the chief in the time of Scylax seem to have been Salamis, Soli and Marium. (See Rawlinson on <bibl n="Hdt. 5.104">Her. v. 104</bibl>.)
</p>
<p>In 500 B.C. the Cyprian Salamis was ruled by a dynasty of Greek princes tributary to Persia (<bibl n="Hdt. 5.104">Her. v. 104</bibl>, 114). Acc. to Isocr., this Greek dynasty &mdash; which claimed descent from Teucrus &mdash; was dispossessed by a Phoenician adventurer (<foreign lang="greek">ἐκ Φοινίκης ἀνὴρ φυγάς</foreign>, &sect; 19), whose descendants (<foreign lang="greek">ἔκγονοι</foreign>, &sect; 21) held the throne until it was again taken from them by Evagoras, the heir of the old Greek kings.
</p>
<p>Grote would place the Phoenician usurpation about 450 B.C. (X. 21), with good reason: though Isocr. at least seems to have conceived it as occurring much earlier. The restoration of the Greek &lsquo;Teucrid&rsquo; dynasty by Evagoras cannot have been later than 411 B.C., in which year Andocides visited Cyprus, and found Evagoras reigning at Salamis, [Lys.] <title>In Andoc.</title> &sect; 28. And Evagoras must have been &lsquo;not merely established, but powerful&rsquo; (Grote X. 25) when he ventured to harbour Conon after Aegospotami (405 B.C.). At the time of his death in 374 B.C. Evagoras was an old man (&sect; 71).

<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">οὔτ’  ἐμπορίῳ χρωμ</lemma> i.e. Salamis did not afford an <foreign lang="greek">ἐμπόριον</foreign>, a centre or seat of commerce, to foreign traders.

<p>. [Or. XIII.] &mdash; &lsquo;Against the Sophists&rsquo;. &mdash; As Isocr. himself tells us (<title>Antid.</title> &sect; 193), this discourse was written at the beginning of his professional life; and it may probably be assigned to the year 391 or 390 B. C. The speech would thus have the character of a manifesto in which, at the outset of his career, the teacher protests against the system adopted by other members of his profession, and declares the principles by which he himself intends to be guided. In its extant form the discourse is plainly imperfect. It breaks off at the point where Isocr. is passing &mdash; as he passes in the introductions to the <title>Busiris</title> and the <title>Encomium on Helen</title> &mdash; from destructive criticism to positive illustration.
</p>
<p>Isocr. accepts for himself the name of <foreign lang="greek">σοφιστής</foreign>, as of honourable import when rightly understood (<title>Antid.</title> &sect; 220), but distinguishes himself from the <foreign lang="greek">ἀγελαῖοι σοφισταί</foreign>, the common herd of the profession (<title>Panathen.</title> &sect; 18).

</p>
<p>(1) The Eristics, &mdash; <foreign lang="greek">οἱ περὶ τὰς ἔριδας διατρίβοντες</foreign>, &sect; 1: whose characteristic is that they profess, for a small fee, to impart absolute knowledge (<foreign lang="greek">ἐπιστήμη</foreign>).

</p>

Now the general aim of these teachers was that of Isocr. himself, viz. to train men for the active duties of civic life. The point of this censure is that they claim too large and infallible an efficacy for their method: <foreign lang="greek">παιδεία</foreign>, instruction, can do much, but it must be aided by <foreign lang="greek">φύσις</foreign>, natural aptitude, and by <foreign lang="greek">ἐμπειρία</foreign>, experience.

<p>(3) The writers of Treatises on Rhetoric, <foreign lang="greek">οἱ τὰς τέχνας γράψαντες</foreign>.

<p>. [Or. XV.] &mdash; &lsquo;On the Antidosis&rsquo;, or &lsquo;Exchange of Properties&rsquo;. &mdash; In the discourse &lsquo;Against the Sophists&rsquo; Isocr. sought to distinguish his own conception of his calling &mdash; as a <foreign lang="greek">σοφιστής</foreign> in the higher sense &mdash; from those of teachers whose views he deemed false and mischievous. In the present discourse &mdash; written 35 years later (353 B.C.) &mdash; he explains his own conception more fully, and defends his art (<foreign lang="greek">ἡ τῶν λόγων παιδεία</foreign>) against its assailants generally. Taken together, these two essays express his whole literary and educational creed, both on its negative and on its positive side: they are the prologue and epilogue of his professional life.
</p>
<p>Isocrates had lately been called upon to undertake the trierarchy, or to make exchange of properties (<hi rend="ital">antidosis</hi>) with his challenger. The case had come to a trial; the trierarchy had been imposed upon Isocrates, and he had discharged it (&sect; 5). Vexed, however, by the general prejudice against his pursuits to which he felt that the verdict had been due, he determined to publish an Apologia &mdash; a discourse &lsquo;which should be an image of his mind and life&rsquo; (&sect; 7). This he throws into the form of a speech made in court against one Lysimachus (&sect; 14), who, by <pb n="300"/> working on popular prejudice, is seeking to cast the burden of the trierarchy upon him. Much of the discourse is not, he allows, in the forensic style (&sect; 10); yet, by the concluding allusion to a verdict (&sect; 323), he aims, in some measure, at sustaining the fiction to the end.
</p>
<p>It is known that, in 355 B.C., Isocrates had really been challenged to an exchange of properties by one Megacleides; and, being unable through illness to appear in court, had been represented by his adopted son Aphareus, whose speech on the occasion is quoted by Dionysius. Now this is probably the trial to which Isocrates refers as having been decided against him. It must have taken place at least a year before the date of this discourse, since it is implied that the public service had now been discharged (&sect; 5). Lysimachus is a fictitious person who stands for the Megacleides of the real trial. &mdash;  <bibl n="Jebb Orators 15.6.1"><title>Attic Orators</title>, II. 134</bibl> f.

<p>. [Or. IV.] &mdash; The title means, &lsquo;A Discourse for a Public Festival&rsquo;: in this case, for the Olympic festival of 380 B.C. The duty of Hellenic unity against the barbarian had already been the theme of Gorgias and of Lysias in speeches delivered at Olympia. It is not likely that, like theirs, the oration of Isocrates was recited at the festival by its author. His want of nerve and voice, and much in the composition itself, would probably have deterred him from such an attempt. The discourse may, indeed, have been recited for him; but it is more likely that it was first introduced to the Greek public by copies circulated at Olympia, and sent to cities in which Isocrates had friends among the leading men.
</p>
<p>His appeal to Panhellenic patriotism was made at a time when such patriotism was sorely needed. By the Peace of Antalcidas in 387 B.C. Artaxerxes II. had become master of the Asiatic Greeks, and ultimate arbiter in the affairs of western Hellas; the Aegean, no longer protected by an Athenian fleet, was infested by pirates; the party strife which the decarchies had exasperated was everywhere filling the smaller cities with bloodshed; and Sparta, regardless of the autonomy which the Peace had guaranteed to every state, was using these troubles for her own ends. In 385 B.C. the Spartans had destroyed Mantineia; in 383, besieged Olynthus; in 382, seized the Cadmeia; in 380, besieged Phlius. <pb n="309"/>
</p>
<p>The <title>Panegyricus</title> falls into two main divisions. In the first (&sect;&sect; 1 &mdash; 132) Isocrates urges that Athens and Sparta, laying aside their jealousies, should assume the joint leadership of Greece. He argues that, if Sparta at present holds the first place, Athens has the better historical claim to it; and that, therefore, a compromise might well be made. In the second part (&sect;&sect; 133 &mdash; 189) he shows the direction in which the forces of Greece, once consolidated, ought to be turned &mdash; namely against Persia.
</p>
<p>The <title>Panegyricus</title> is the earliest and the most complete expression of its author's ruling political idea &mdash; the idea of a Panhellenic War on Persia. This, he believed, would heal Greek discord, liberate the Asiatic Greeks, draft the roving and lawless paupers who infested Greece into new Asiatic settlements, and bring wealth into Greece Proper. (See the <title>Life</title> of Isocr., <bibl n="Jebb Orators 12.13"><title>Attic Orators</title>, II. 20</bibl> f.) The tradition that Isocr. spent ten or more years on this discourse (Quint. X. 4: Plut. <title>Mor.</title> 350 E) shows the ancient feeling that it was a masterpiece of careful work. It is, indeed, admirable alike for finished brilliancy of composition and for the lucid power with which a wide range of topics and a multitude of details are marshalled in subordination to the central thought.

<p>. [Or. v.] &mdash; This appeal to Philip of Macedon may fitly be taken after the <title>Panegyricus.</title> As the latter recommends that Athens should lead a Panhellenic War against Persia, so this discourse presses the task on Philip. It is the final expression &mdash; as the other was the first &mdash; of a lifelong desire.
</p>
<p>Philip had taken Amphipolis in 358 B.C. and Potidaea in 356. The hostilities between him and Athens, carried on intermittently from 356, were closed in March, 346, by the so-called Peace of Philocrates. Before that event Isocrates had been composing a letter to Philip &lsquo;On Amphipolis&rsquo;, urging, in favour of peace, that Amphipolis, the chief cause of the war, was not a desirable possession either for Athens or for the king of Macedon (&sect;&sect; 1, 3).
</p>
<p>This letter had not been sent when peace was concluded (&sect; 7). Isocrates now writes on another and a larger subject. He sees in Philip, at length reconciled to Athens, the man who can lead the united Hellenes against Persia. Ever since the failure of the <title>Panegyricus</title> to bring about such an expedition under the joint leadership of Athens and Sparta, he had been looking for an individual powerful enough to execute his favourite plan (&sect;&sect; 84, 128, 129). He had already applied to Dionysius I. &mdash; probably about 368 B.C. (<title>Ep.</title> I. &sect; 8) &mdash; and in 356 to Archidamus III. (<title>Ep.</title> IX. &sect; 16). This oration was addressed to Philip soon after the Peace (&sect;&sect; 8, 56), but before the conclusion of the Sacred War (&sect;&sect; 54, 74); that is, between March and July, 346 B.C.
</p>
<p>The most striking characteristic of the whole discourse is the recognition of Philip as the first of Hellenes and the natural champion of Hellas, in whom &mdash; though his subjects are aliens &mdash; the Heraclid spirit is as true as it was in the Argive T&ecirc;menus, the founder of his dynasty. &mdash; <bibl n="Jebb Orators 16.1.1"><title>Attic Orators</title>, II. 166</bibl> &mdash; 176.

<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ἅπερ ἐπέστειλα</lemma> &lsquo;as I said in my letter to Dionysius  after he had acquired the tyranny&rsquo;.

Dionysius became tyrant of Syracuse in 406 B.C., and the probable date of the Letter to him is 368 B.C.

Isocr. felt that the war must be led either by a city or by a prince.

Not long after these <foreign lang="greek">δεκαρχίαι</foreign> had been established by Lysander (in 405 &mdash; 4 B.C.) a reaction set in against them, and in many cities they were either dissolved or modified, with the express approval of the Spartan Ephors. When Agesilaus went to Asia in 396 B.C., Lysander accompanied him, &lsquo;in order&rsquo;, as Xen. says (<title>Hellen.</title> III. 4. 2), &lsquo;<hi rend="ital">to restore</hi>, <hi rend="ital">with the help of Agesilaus</hi>, the decarchies which he [Lysander] had established in the cities, but which had been banished (<foreign lang="greek">ἐκπεπτωκυίας</foreign>) by the (Spartan) Ephors, who directed the cities to resume their traditionary constitutions&rsquo;.
</p>
<p>Isocr. correctly represents the general situation in the Asiatic Hellas of 396 B.C.; but he does not accurately describe the attitude of Agesilaus. It was Lysander, not Agesilaus, who desired to restore the <foreign lang="greek">ἑταῖροι</foreign>, the oligarchical partisans. Agesilaus appeared in contrast with Lysander as <foreign lang="greek">δημοτικός</foreign> (Plut. <title>Ages.</title> c. 7). Isocr. seems to confound the <hi rend="ital">political</hi> enterprise, in which Lysander sought (not very successfully) to engage Agesilaus, with the marked eagerness of Agesilaus to enrich or honour his <hi rend="ital">personal</hi> friends (see Xen. <title>Ages.</title> I. 18, <foreign lang="greek">πάντες παμπλήθη χρήματα ἔλαβον, κ.τ.λ.</foreign>): and this misapprehension appears when, in the passage cited above (<title>Epist.</title> IX. &sect; 13), he uses the phrase <foreign lang="greek">τοὺς ἑαυτοῦ φίλους</foreign>.
</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ἐν κακοῖς...τὴν ταραχὴν τὴν ἐνθάδε γ</lemma>.] i.e. (1) The <title>Asiatic Greeks</title> were involved in troubles and dangers by that strife between the democratic and oligarchic parties which arose from the attempt to restore the oligarchic exiles.

<head><foreign lang="greek">Πλαταικός</foreign></head>
<p>. [Or. XIV.] &mdash; The revolution of 379 B.C. at Thebes had been a blow to Spartan influence throughout Hellas, and especially in Boeotia. Agesilaus in 378 and 377, Cleombrotus in 378 and 376, had invaded Boeotia without gaining any advantage. By the end of 376 the oligarchies supported by Sparta had been abolished in all the Boeotian towns except Orchomenus; and the Boeotian Confederacy, with Thebes at its head, had been reconstituted.
</p>
<p>After its destruction in 427 B.C. Plataea had been left desolate till 386, when it was rebuilt by Sparta as a stronghold <pb n="329"/> against Thebes. Cut off from Spartan support, Plataea had come (377 or 376 B.C.) into the Boeotian Confederacy; but, like Thespiae and Tanagra (&sect; 9), had joined it unwillingly. The relief felt by most other towns at riddance from the philoSpartan oligarchies was more than balanced, in the case of Thespiae, Tanagra and Plataea, by hatred of Thebes. Diodorus states that the Plataeans secretly offered their town to Athens. At any rate the alarm felt at Plataea was so great that it was only on the days of public assemblies at Thebes that the men ventured to go into the fields, leaving their wives and children within the walls.
</p>
<p>On one of these days a Theban force under the Boeotarch Neocles surprised Plataea, in the latter half of 373 B.C. The town was destroyed, and the territory was again annexed to Thebes. The inhabitants, with such property as they could carry, sought refuge, like their ancestors in 427, at Athens. Their case was discussed there, not merely in the Ecclesia, but in the congress of the allies (<foreign lang="greek">συνέδριον</foreign> &sect; 21); Callistratus being the foremost advocate of Plataea, as Epameinondas of Thebes. It was not till 338, after Chaeroneia, that Plataea was restored; this time through the enmity of Philip, as formerly through the enmity of Sparta, towards Thebes.
</p>
<p>The speech of Isocrates is supposed to be spoken by a Plataean before the Ecclesia; and there is nothing in the matter or form of the speech itself to make it improbable that it was actually so delivered.

Isocr. is thinking here of the fact that the Plataeans (with the Thespieans) were the only Greeks who joined with the Athenians in meeting the Persians at Marathon: cp. <bibl n="Thuc. 3.54">Thuc. III. 54</bibl>. But, as <foreign lang="greek">ἐκλιπόντων</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">συνανασῶσαι</foreign> show, he has confused this with the crisis of the later invasion, when Athens was twice occupied by the Persians &mdash; first under Xerxes, in the autumn of 480 B.C., secondly under Mardonius in the early summer of 479. Similarly in <title>Panegyr.</title> &sect; 94 he supposes that the Persian offers which the Athenians rejected were made by Xerxes in 480 B.C. They were really made by Mardonius in 479. Cp.

Till 358 B.C. the trierarchy had been discharged by one person, or by two persons jointly.

<p>. [Or. VI.] &mdash; At the beginning of 366 B.C.  Sparta, Athens, Corinth and the smaller states dependent on Corinth, as Epidaurus and Phlius, were allied, and were at war with Thebes and her allies, of whom the chief was Argos. But in that year the treacherous attempt of Athens to seize Corinth gave the Corinthians a sense of insecurity and a desire for peace. They accordingly sent envoys to Thebes, asking on what terms peace would be granted to the allies. The Thebans prescribed, as one condition of peace, the recognition of the independence of Messene, the new state founded by Epameinondas in 370. A congress met at Sparta. The Spartans refused to recognise the independence of Messene; and accordingly remained, with Athens, at war against Thebes. The Corinthians, Epidaurians, Phliasians, and probably some other small states, accepted the condition, and made peace on their own account, B.C. 366: see &sect; 91.
</p>
    <p>The <title>Archidamus</title> is in the form of a deliberative speech. It purports to be spoken in 366 B.C. by Archidamus III., son of the king Agesilaus, during a debate at Sparta on the Theban proposal. There seems no reason to doubt that the speech was written in 366 B.C., either just before or soon after the actual decision of the question. It may have been composed in the first instance as an exercise; yet, as discussing a question of contemporary politics from the point of view which a large party at Sparta must really have taken, it claims to be considered as something more. Isocrates probably sent it to Archidamus, &mdash; not, of course, for delivery, but as a proof of sympathy with the Spartan policy. &mdash; <bibl n="Jebb Orators 16.2.2"><title>Attic Orators</title>, II. 193</bibl> f.

<p>. [Or. VII.] &mdash; As a picture of the older Athenian Democracy this discourse supplements the <title>Panegyricus.</title> The latter describes the external relations of Athens in her great days; the <title>Areopagiticus</title>, the inner life.
</p>
<p>In this speech Isocrates contrasts the Athenian Democracy as it existed in the middle of the 4th century B.C. with the Democracy of Solon and of Cleisthenes (&sect; 16). He dwells chiefly on two features of the elder Democracy: &mdash; 1. the preference of election (<foreign lang="greek">αἵρεσις</foreign>) to ballot (<foreign lang="greek">κλήρωσις</foreign>) in the appointment of State officers, &sect;&sect; 22 ff.; 2. the supervision of public morals exercised by the Council of the Areiopagus: &sect;&sect; 36 &mdash; 55. It is owing to the prominence of the latter topic that the speech has been called <foreign lang="greek">Ἀρεοπαγιτικός</foreign>. It is cast in a deliberate form. Isocrates supposes himself to have given notice in writing to the prytanes of an intention to speak &lsquo;On <pb n="341"/> the Safety of Athens&rsquo; (<foreign lang="greek">περὶ σωτηρίας πρόσοδον ἀπογράψασθαι</foreign>, &sect;&sect; 1, 15); and to be now urging in the ecclesia, as absolutely necessary to the welfare of the city, the restoration of censorial power to the Areiopagus (cp. &sect; 84). Like the <title>De Pace</title> (Or. VIII.), this speech was not delivered, or meant for delivery, in the Assembly. The deliberative form was adopted merely for the sake of giving greater life and impressiveness to the pleading.
</p>
<p>The date is to be inferred from five indications: &mdash; (1) There was now peace on the frontiers of Attica (<foreign lang="greek">τὰ περὶ τὴν χώραν</foreign>), and a confident sense of security at Athens, &sect;&sect; 1 &mdash; 3: (2) The Athenians had &lsquo;lost all the cities in Thrace&rsquo; (&sect; 9): (3) had spent more than 1000 talents on mercenaries, <hi rend="ital">ib</hi>: (4) had got a bad name in Hellas and incurred the enmity of Persia, &sect; 10: (5) had been forced &lsquo;to save the friends of the Thebans&rsquo; and to lose their own allies. The latter half of 355 B.C. is the date to which these indications seem to point. (See <bibl n="Jebb Orators 16.2.3"><title>Attic Orators</title>, II. 202</bibl> f., where the question of the date is examined in detail.)
</p>
<p>The powers exercised by the Areiopagus before the reforms of Ephialtes were of two kinds, definite and indefinite. The definite powers were: 1. A limited criminal jurisdiction: 2. the supreme direction of religious worship, especially of the cultus of the Eumenides. The indefinite powers were: 1. A general supervision of all magistrates and law-courts: 2. a general guardianship of the laws, with the right of protest (though not of veto) when proposed new laws conflicted with old: 3. a general control of the education of the young: 4. a general censorship of public morals: 5. competence to assume, in emergencies of the State, a dictatorial authority.
</p>
<p>The definite powers of the Areiopagus were never at any time taken from it. But Ephialtes abolished almost wholly the indefinite powers. It is for the ievival of these &mdash; especially of (3) and (4) &mdash; that Isocrates is anxious. While it possessed these, the Areiopagus had been the strongest influence, though mainly a negative influence, in the State; it had been able to impress a conservative character upon the whole civic body. Deprived of these, it was merely a criminal court of narrow competence. Its connection with what was most venerable in the old religion, and the high standing of its individual members, still secured to it, indeed, a large measure of respect. Isocrates speaks of the good influence which, even in his own day, wrought on those who became members of the college. But politically the Areiopagus was now powerless. The plea of Isocrates for a restoration of its strength is strikingly illustrated by the protest of Aeschylus against its enfeeblement. It is not on any well-defined function, but rather on those prerogatives <pb n="342"/> which, being vague, were boundless, that orator and poet alike insist: &mdash;

The other 5000 were divided into 10 sections of 500 each. On the morning of each day when the courts sat, lots were cast to determine which court should be assigned, for that day, to each section. In some cases only part of one section was employed; in others, two or more sections sat together, &mdash; the number of dicasts in a court ranging from 200 to 1500 or even 2000. The courts were assigned by lots to the dicasts (<foreign lang="greek">τῶν δικαστηρίων ἐπικεκληρωμένων</foreign>, Dem. <title>Adv. Pantaen.</title> &sect; 39). Each dicast received a ticket (<foreign lang="greek">σύμβολον</foreign> &mdash; not <foreign lang="greek">πινάκιον</foreign>, which denoted the tablet given to each of the 6000 heliasts of the year), and a staff, <foreign lang="greek">βακτηρία</foreign>, of the <hi rend="ital">colour</hi> which distinguished the court in which he was to sit (<foreign lang="greek">ὁμόχροος τῷ δικαστηρίῳ</foreign>, schol.

<p>All who &lsquo;drew lots before the law-courts&rsquo; were already heliasts. The only uncertainty was as to whether they should be employed on that particular day.

<p>. [Or. XIX.] &mdash; The six forensic speeches  of Isocrates which are extent cover a period of about ten years, 403 &mdash; 393 B.C. The speech Against Euthynus (XXI) may be placed in 403, immediately after the restoration of the Democracy; that Against Callimachus (XVIII) in 402; the <title>De Bigis</title> (XVI) in 397 or 396; the speech Against Lochites (XX) in 394; the Trapeziticus (XVII) and Aegineticus (XIX) in the second half of 394 or early in 393.
</p>
<p>In his later writings Isocrates nowhere recognises this phase of his own activity. He speaks with contempt of those who write for the law-courts, and emphatically claims it as his own merit that he chose nobler themes. It may have been partly the tone of such passages which emboldened his adopted son Aphareus to assert that Isocrates had never written a forensic speech. This statement is decisively rejected by Dionysius, who concludes, on the authority of Cephisodorus, the orator's pupil, that Isocrates wrote a certain number of such speeches, though not nearly so many as Aristotle had reported. The modern hypothesis that Isocrates composed the extant forensic orations merely as exercises (<foreign lang="greek">μελέται</foreign>), not for real causes, is another attempt to explain his later tone. But these later utterances merely mean that Isocrates regarded his former work for the law-courts as an unworthy accident of <pb n="352"/> his early life, previous to the beginning of his true career. Nowhere, be it observed, does he deny that he had written for the courts, or that, to use his own phrase, he had been a dollmaker before he became a Pheidias. He only says that his <hi rend="ital">choice</hi>, his real calling, lay in another direction. &mdash; <bibl n="Jebb Orators 1.3"><title>Attic Orators</title>, I. 7</bibl> f.
</p>
<p>The <title>Aegineticus</title> is so called because the case to which it refers was tried in Aegina, &mdash; probably, to judge from the indications in &sect;&sect; 18 &mdash; 20 and 36, at the end of 394 or early in 393 B.C. Thrasylochus, a citizen of Siphnos, one of the Cyclades, had at his death left his property to the speaker, whom he had previously adopted as his son. The speaker's right to the inheritance is disputed by a daughter of the testator; and the speech is in answer to her claim (<foreign lang="greek">ἐπιδικασία</foreign>). The case is tried at Aegina, where the speaker had settled (<foreign lang="greek">κατοικισάμενος</foreign>, &sect; 24) before his death. &mdash; <title>Att. Or.</title> II. 217.
</p>
<p>The narrative, of which the following passage is the chief part, is briefly as follows. The speaker's object is to show that the will is not only genuine, but also just and reasonable, since his own conduct towards the testator Thrasylochus had established a strong claim. In the first place he had saved the very property now in question. Thrasylochus and his brother Sopolis, citizens of Siphnos, had, for security, placed the greater part of their fortune in the neighbouring island of Paros. Paros was suddenly seized by a party of democratic exiles, Parians and Siphnians, led by one Pas&imacr;nus. At the risk of his life, the speaker sailed by night to Paros, and carried the endangered property back to Siphnos. Presently the democratic masters of Paros attacked and took Siphnos itself. The speaker &mdash;  whose family belonged to the aristocracy of the island, and had even given it kings &mdash; was among those who were forced to fly. He took with him, not only his own mother and sister, but Thrasylochus, who was then in weak health. The speaker and his family wished to remain at Melos. But Thrasylochus entreated them to accompany him to Troezen; and, though they knew the place to be unhealthy, they consented. The speaker's sister and mother died soon after their arrival. He afterwards nursed Thrasylochus through a long and distressing illness in Aegina. During that illness the half sister of Thrasylochus, who now claims his property, never once visited him; nor, on his death, did she attend his funeral (&sect;&sect; 16 &mdash; 33).

From &sect; 36 of this speech it is clear that the speaker belonged to the oligarchic party, and therefore that the exiles before whom he fled were democratic. The democratic revolution, led by the otherwise unknown Pas&imacr;nus, may have been encouraged by the blow dealt to Sparta &mdash; and at the same time to oligarchy throughout Hellas &mdash; by the victory of Conon at Cnidus in the autumn of 394 B.C. &mdash; <foreign lang="greek">ὑπεκκείμενα</foreign>, perf. pass. of <foreign lang="greek">ὑπεκτίθημι</foreign>: cp. <bibl n="Thuc. 1.89">Thuc.

<p>. [Epist. v.] &mdash; In writing to Philip of Macedon, who was not then at open war with Athens, Isocrates takes the opportunity of enclosing a letter to the young Alexander. Philip was in Thrace or the Chersonese from May, 342 B.C., to the latter part of 339 B.C.; and, at some time after his departure, appointed Alexander his regent in Macedonia. But, when this letter was written, that arrangement had not yet been made. Alexander, a boy of fourteen, is busy with his studies.

<p>. [Epist. III.] &mdash; A letter written to Philip of Macedon in 338 B.C., some time after the battle of Chaeroneia, when Isocrates had completed his ninety-eighth year. It is thus the latest of all his extant writings.
</p>
<p>The genuineness of the Third Letter has been doubted (as by Prof. E. Curtius <title>Hist. Gr.</title> v. 459): but there seems to be no ground, internal or external, for doubting it, except the difficulty of reconciling it with the tradition that Isocrates committed suicide on learning the tidings of Chaeroneia. [Dionys. <title>De Isocr.</title> I.; Paus. I. 18. 8; Philostr. I. 17. 4; Lucian (?) <foreign lang="greek">Μακρόβιοι</foreign> &sect; 23; (Plut.) <title>Vit. Isocr.</title> &sect; 14; Anon. Biogr.] According to the usual account, he was in the palaestra of Hippocrates at Athens when he heard the news of <pb n="359"/> the fatal defeat. He repeated three verses of Euripides &mdash; verses commemorating three aliens who had been conquerors of Greeks, &mdash; Danaus, Pelops, Cadmus &mdash; and four days afterwards, on the burial-day of those who fell at Chaeroneia, he died of voluntary starvation. Undoubtedly Isocrates regretted the struggle between Athens and Philip: but the result of the struggle was that the idea of his life &mdash; a Panhellenic war against the barbarian &mdash; had been made possible. The conduct of Philip to Athens after Chaeroneia was studiously temperate and conciliatory; there was nothing in it to estrange Isocrates from his ideal leader, who, having struck one necessary blow, was now bent on healing the discords of Greece. It would be more easy to conceive that Isocrates should have destroyed himself because he saw Athens still resolved to resist, and could not support the anguish of a divided loyalty. But, to my mind, the Letter itself leaves little room for doubting that it was written after the conclusion of the peace between Philip and Athens, and was taken to Philip by Antipater on his return: see &sect;&sect; 1, 2. Cp. Sch&auml;fer, <title>Demosth. u. seine Zeit</title>, III. 25. &mdash; <bibl n="Jebb Orators 12.17"><title>Attic Orators</title>, II. 31</bibl> f.: 255, note 1.

<div3 type="section" n="1">
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">διελέχθην καὶ πρὸς Ἀντίπατρον</lemma> Demades, who had been taken prisoner at Chaeroneia, was sent by Philip to Athens as the bearer of proposals for peace. The Athenian captives were to be restored: Oropus was to be transferred from Thebes to Athens. On the other hand, Athens was required to recognise Philip as the military head of Greece. On receiving this message, the Athenian Ecclesia sent an embassy to Philip, who was then at Thebes. Among the envoys were Demades, Phocion and Aeschines. They were hospitably entertained by Philip, and returned to Athens with the message that Philip released the prisoners without ransom, and would presently send, for interment at Athens, the remains of those who had fallen at Chaeroneia.
</p>
<p>Antipater, the young Alexander, and probably Alcimachus, were the envoys who escorted these relics to Athens. By them the conditions of peace were formally proposed to the Senate and the Ecclesia. Demades then drew up a <foreign lang="greek">ψήφισμα</foreign> by which the treaty &mdash; known as &lsquo;the Peace of Demades&rsquo; &mdash; was finally ratified. The &lsquo;conversation with Antipater&rsquo;, to which Isocr. refers, must have been held on the occasion of this visit. (Cp. Sch&auml;fer, <title>Dem.</title> III. 19 &mdash; 27.)

<div1 type="orator" n="Isaeus">
<head>Isaeus</head>
<p>ISAEUS: born circ. 420 B.C.: died circ. 350 B.C. Approximate  period of extant work: 390 &mdash; 353 B.C. <title>Life</title> in <bibl n="Jebb Orators 19.1"><title>Attic Orators</title>, II. 261</bibl> &mdash; 271.
</p>
<p>Style. Isaeus has a twofold interest. He is the earliest Attic master &mdash; not, indeed, of forensic rhetoric &mdash; but of strict forensic argument. He also represents the final period of transition in the history of Attic oratory, the transition from the studied &lsquo;plainness&rsquo; (<foreign lang="greek">ἀφέλεια</foreign>) of the Lysian school to the open triumph of that technical mastery (<foreign lang="greek">δεινότης</foreign>) which reached its summit in Demosthenes. We have seen that the peculiar significance of Isocrates is rather for literary rhetoric than for oratory. With Isaeus, we return to the development of practical oratory: and his place in this must be determined, first, by his relation to his predecessor Lysias, secondly by his relation to Demosthenes.
</p>
<p>Isaeus closely resembles Lysias in diction (<foreign lang="greek">λέξις</foreign>): the qualities of purity, conciseness, clearness, simplicity, vividness (<foreign lang="greek">ἐνάργεια</foreign>) are common to both. In composition (<foreign lang="greek">σύνθεσις</foreign>), on the other hand, there is marked difference. Lysias broke through the rigid monotony of the earlier periodic style, replacing it by one which was more flexible and various: yet, though his composition as a whole has ease and variety, his love of antithesis frequently gives too much stiffness and uniformity to the structure of his periods themselves. Isaeus is exempt from this excessive love of antithesis: but, on the whole, his composition is distinguished from that of Lysias mainly by the stamp of conscious art. In reading him we have a continual sense of trained and confident skill. The more open and vigorous character of this art, as compared with that <pb n="362"/> of Lysias, is illustrated by the freedom with which Isaeus employs the animated &lsquo;figures of thought&rsquo; (<foreign lang="greek">σχήματα διανοίας</foreign>), especially the rhetorical question (e.g. or. VIII. &sect; 28, p. 194). This does not deprive Isaeus of ethical persuasiveness. Reasoned remonstrance, vigorous contention, just indignation, are powerfully expressed: it is only in the delineation of the ingenuous youth or the plain citizen that he yields to the veiled subtlety of Lysias. In the treatment of subject-matter the contrast gains strength. Lysias is usually content with the simple four-fold partition, &mdash; <foreign lang="greek">προοίμιον, διήγησις, πίστεις, ἐπίλογος</foreign>. Isaeus interweaves narrative and proof, managing his complex material with manifold tactics, &mdash; doing everything with art, but nothing by rule. Lysias seldom attempts more than a rhetorical or sketchy proof: Isaeus elaborates a complete logical proof: as Dionysius says, Lysias speaks <foreign lang="greek">κατ’  ἐνθύμημα</foreign>, but Isaeus, <foreign lang="greek">καὶ κατ’  ἐπιχείρημα</foreign> (<bibl n="Jebb Orators 20.6"><title>Attic Orators</title>, II. 289</bibl>).
</p>
<p>&lsquo;The oratorical power&rsquo; (<foreign lang="greek">δεινότης</foreign>) &lsquo;of Demosthenes&rsquo;, says the same critic, &lsquo;took its seeds and beginnings (<foreign lang="greek">τὰ σπέρματα καὶ τὰς ἀρχάς</foreign>, <title>Isae.</title> 20) from Isaeus&rsquo;. This is true in the limited sense that Demosthenes derived important hints from Isaeus (1) in versatile arrangement of material, (2) in elaboration of systematic proof, (3) more generally, in that art of close and strenuous conflict, the art of grappling with the adversary's case point by point, which the Greek critics mean by <foreign lang="greek">ἀγωνίζεσθαι, τὸ ἐναγώνιον</foreign>. The two speeches of Demosthenes against Aphobus (363 B.C.), and the two against Onetor (362 B.C.), were written at the time when their author (<hi rend="ital">aet.</hi> 22 or 23) was probably most under the influence of Isaeus. The two speeches against Onetor &mdash; which exhibit the influence in its most mature form &mdash; are especially Isaean in this, that they end, not with an ordinary peroration, but with a keen argument swiftly thrust home (Dem. <title>Adv. Onet.</title> I. &sect;&sect; 37 &mdash; 39: II. &sect;&sect; 10 &mdash; 14). On the other hand these earliest speeches of Demosthenes have a thoroughly original stamp. The link between Isaeus and Demosthenes is chiefly technical, depending on the essential continuity of Attic prose expression as an art. It is also, in a narrower sense, personal, so far as a vigorous intensity of logic was common to the intellectual character of both. But that is all. The great achievements of Demosthenes are his own: so, too, the masterpieces of Isaeus, in their own kind, bear a distinctive stamp of keen ability and consummate art. &mdash; Cp. <bibl n="Jebb Orators 20.1"><title>Attic Orators</title>, II. 273</bibl> &mdash; 310.
</p>
<p>On the Works of Isaeus generally, ib. II. 311 &mdash; 368. The striking characteristic of the extant twelve speeches is the contrast between monotony of subject and versatility of tone: the form has its affinities at once with earlier and with later <pb n="363"/> style. Of the twelve, the three typical speeches are (1) the fifth, <title>On the Estate of Dicaeogenes</title> &mdash; Lysian in the graceful and persuasive management of narrative: (2) the eleventh, <title>On the Estate of Hagnias</title> &mdash; Demosthenic in its unity of impulse and its victorious mastery of technical resource: (3) the eighth, <title>On the Estate of Ciron</title> &mdash; distinctively Isaean in its mediation between these types.

<p>. [Or. v.] &lsquo;On the Estate of Dicaeogenes&rsquo;. &mdash; Dicaeogenes, son of Menexenus &mdash; whom, for distinction from his grandfather, of the same name, we call Dicaeogenes II. &mdash; had four sisters. These, when he died childless, shared among them two-thirds of his estate. The other third went to his first cousin, Dicaeogenes III., son of his uncle Proxenus, in accordance with a will produced by Proxenus, in which the deceased declared Dicaeogenes III. to be his adopted son, and heir to one-third of his estate (<foreign lang="greek">υἱὸς ποιητὸς ἐπὶ τρίτῳ μέρει τῆς οὐσίας</foreign>, &sect; 6).
</p>
<p>Twelve years later (&sect; 7), Dicaeogenes III. alleged that this first will was invalid. Under a <hi rend="ital">second</hi> will, he said, he was heir, not to a third only, but to the whole of the estate. He gained his cause. The sisters of the testator were deprived of their shares, and the whole was transferred to Dicaeogenes III.
</p>
<p>Ten years more elapsed (&sect; 35). Meanwhile the nephews of the testator had grown up. They now resolved to seek redress for their mothers and themselves. They began by bringing an action against one Lycon, who had been called by Dicaeogenes III. as a witness to the second will. Lycon was convicted of perjury.
</p>
<p>The state of things was now this: &mdash; Dicaeogenes III. had himself declared the first will &mdash; which gave him one-third &mdash; to be invalid. The judges of Lycon had declared the second will  &mdash; which gave him all &mdash; to be false. Accordingly, the nephews (with the exception of Menexenus II., who had deserted their cause) now sued Dicaeogenes III. for the <hi rend="ital">whole</hi> estate. One Leochares interposed a protest (<foreign lang="greek">διαμαρτυρία</foreign>) that their claim was inadmissible. They indicted Leochares for perjury. Leochares was certain to be convicted. Dicaeogenes III. therefore made a compromise. He was to keep his original onethird, and leave his adversaries in secure possession of the other two-thirds. Leochares and Mnesiptolemus became his sureties for the performance of this engagement. <pb n="364"/> <figure/></p><p>In &sect; 26 according to the vulgate, Dicaeogenes III. betroths to Protarchides <foreign lang="greek">τὴν ἀδελφὴν τὴν ἑαυτοῦ</foreign>.

    <p>Leochares is now sued (by an <foreign lang="greek">ἐγγύης δίκη</foreign>) to discharge his liability as surety, since his principal Dicaeogenes III. has made default. The speaker, son of Polyaratus (&sect; 5), is one of the nephews of the testator, and is supported by his first-cousin Cephisodotus (&sect; 2). &mdash; <bibl n="Jebb Orators 21.7.1"><title>Attic Orators</title>, II. 349</bibl>.

</p>
<p>The speaker first defines his case by quoting his own affidavit (<foreign lang="greek">ἀντωμοσία</foreign>, &sect; 1). He then refers to a register (<foreign lang="greek">ἀπογραφή</foreign>) of the property left by his uncle, to prove that Dicaeogenes III. has not refunded the due amount, and that Leochares has therefore not discharged his suretyship (<foreign lang="greek">τὴν ἐξεγγύην οὐκ ἀπέδωκεν</foreign>), &sect;&sect; 1 &mdash; 4.

Cp. <bibl n="Thuc. 6.91">Thuc.

The prediction was fulfilled, since, as <bibl n="Thuc. 7.28">Thuc. VII. 28</bibl> says, all the citizens were required for military duty.

A childless Athenian citizen could, either during his life or by testament, adopt any Athenian citizen as his son and heir. Permission to execute a will is said to have been first given to Athenian citizens by the laws of Solon, but it was expressly restricted to those citizens who had no direct male descendants. The faculty of adoption was the germ of testamentary power, and was intended primarily to meet a case in which the head of a house left behind him, at his decease, no one duly qualified by nearness of blood to offer the sacrifices at the hearth and the grave. In the Hindoo system of succession the religious aspect of adoption is still the foremost one: (see the Tagore Law Lectures for 1870, Lect. IX. <title>On the Rite of Adoption</title>, pp. 208 f., by Mr Herbert Cowell). The Roman will of Cicero's time was already a true testament. The Athenian <foreign lang="greek">διαθήκη</foreign> belongs to an intermediate stage. While the religious continuity of the family is still nominally the first principle, the main object in practice is to enlarge the childless testator's choice of heirs. &mdash; Cp.

<p>. [Or. XI.] &mdash; &lsquo;On  the Estate of Hagnias&rsquo;. &mdash; Theopompus, the speaker and defendant, possesses the estate of Hagnias. Half of this estate is claimed from Theompompus on behalf of his own nephew, the son of Stratocles. The form of the prosecution is an <title>Information for maltreatment</title> (<foreign lang="greek">εἰσαγγελία κακώσεως</foreign>); the son of Stratocles being considered as an orphan whom his uncle, Theopompus, has wronged. The date is 359 B.C. &mdash; <bibl n="Jebb Orators 21.7.1"><title>Attic Orators</title>, II. 354</bibl> &mdash; 8.
</p>
<p>Theopompus had already, under a legal decision, taken this estate away from Phylomach&egrave; II. (see the stemma), daughter of his own second cousin Eubulides II.
</p>
<p>The essential points are these: &mdash; (1) Theopompus and Hagnias were the sons of <foreign lang="greek">ἀνεψιοί</foreign>, first-cousins, and were therefore <hi rend="ital">second</hi>-cousins to each other: (2) Eubulides II., father of Phylomach&egrave; II., was <hi rend="ital">first</hi>-cousin of Hagnias. <pb n="380"/> <figure/> <pb n="381"/>
</p>
<div3 type="section" n="1">

<head>&sect;&sect; 1 &mdash; 19.</head>

<p>Theopompus begins by reading the laws which regulate the succession of collateral kinsfolk to an estate; and shows that, by these, his nephew, the son of Stratocles, is excluded. There is no reason to suppose that the <foreign lang="greek">προοίμιον</foreign> is lost. The ninth oration of Isaeus, <foreign lang="greek">περὶ τοῦ Ἀστυφίλου κλήρου</foreign> (<bibl n="Jebb Orators 21.5.4"><title>Attic Orators</title>, II. 330</bibl>), and the third, <foreign lang="greek">περὶ τοῦ Πύρρου κλήρου</foreign> (ib. 339), begin with similar abruptness.
</p>
<p>&sect;&sect; 1, 2. <foreign lang="greek">διὰ ταῦθ’...κληρονομίαν</foreign>] &lsquo;I have read you the laws, because the plaintiff contends that, under the first of them, the boy [the son of Stratocles] is entitled to half the estate; but this is untrue. For Hagnias was not our brother [<foreign lang="greek">ἡμῖν</foreign>, Theopompus himself and the other second-cousins of Hagnias, &sect; 10]; but the law, speaking of a <hi rend="ital">brother's</hi> property, has given the inheritance &mdash; 
</p>
<p>(1) <hi rend="ital">first</hi>, to brothers, being sons of the same father, and the children of such brothers; this is the first degree of kinship to the deceased: but failing these,
</p>
<p>(2) <hi rend="ital">secondly</hi>, the law calls to the succession sisters by the same father, and their children: failing these,
</p>
<p>(3) <hi rend="ital">in the third degree</hi> (<foreign lang="greek">τρίτῳ γένει</foreign>) it gives the preference to first cousins (<foreign lang="greek">ἀνεψιοῖς</foreign>) on the father's side, continuing it to their children (<foreign lang="greek">μέχρι ἀνεψιῶν παίδων</foreign>=<foreign lang="greek">μέχρι ἀνεψιαδῶν</foreign>).
</p>
<p>(4) Failing these also, the law reverts to the direct line [<foreign lang="greek">εἰς τὸ γένος</foreign>, the <hi rend="ital">direct</hi> lineage on the <hi rend="ital">maternal</hi> side, as opp. to collateral kinship on the paternal] and gives the ownership of the property [<foreign lang="greek">ποιεῖ κυρίους αὐτῶν</foreign>, <hi rend="ital">sc.</hi> <foreign lang="greek">τῶν χρημάτων</foreign>] to the kinsmen of the deceased on the mother's side, under the same rules by which, in the first instance (<foreign lang="greek">ἐξ ἀρχῆς</foreign>), it called the paternal kinsfolk to the inheritance&rsquo;.
</p>
<p>The gist of the whole argument is that Theopompus, being the son of a <hi rend="ital">first-cousin</hi> (<foreign lang="greek">ἀνεψιοῦ παῖς</foreign>) is, under provision (3), in the succession on the paternal side, while his nephew, being the son of a <hi rend="ital">second-cousin</hi>, is out of it.

<p>. [Or. VIII.] &lsquo;On the Estate of Ciron&rsquo;. &mdash; Ciron married his first-cousin, by whom he had one daughter. This daughter was married, first, to Nausimenes; secondly, to another husband by whom she had two sons, of whom the eldest is the speaker.
</p>
<p>After the death of his first wife, Ciron married the sister of one Diocles, and had by her two sons, both of whom died young.
</p>
<p>At the death of Ciron, his estate was claimed by his daughter's eldest son. But the son of Ciron's brother, instigated by Diocles, set up a counter-claim on two distinct grounds: 1. That Ciron's grandson is illegitimate: 2. That, supposing him legitimate, a brother's son has a better claim than a daughter's son.
</p>
<p>This speech is the defendant's answer.
</p>
<p>The only indication of the date is that the speaker and his brother were born after the archonship of Eucleides, Ol. 94. 2, 403 B.C. (&sect; 43, <foreign lang="greek">μετ’  Εὐκλείδην γὰρ ἄρχοντα γεγόναμεν</foreign>). The speech cannot, then, be put before 383 B.C. On the other hand, the speaker's plea of &lsquo;utter inexperience&rsquo; (&sect; 5) implies youthfulness. Now, if he was a young man, the date cannot be much below 383, since otherwise it would have been superfluous for him to tell the judges that he was born after <pb n="389"/> 403.

<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">τήν οὐσίαν...διαθήκην</lemma> &lsquo;Diocles holds the property, which supports his present splendour, by an act of usurpation (<foreign lang="greek">ἀλλοτρίαν</foreign>). Three sisters, children of the same mother, were left heiresses to the estate; but he contrived to represent himself as their father's adopted son, though the father had made no will recognising such adoption&rsquo;. As Diocles became guardian (&sect; 42) to the son of one of these sisters, they were probably his own half-sisters on the maternal side (cp. <foreign lang="greek">τὴν ἀδελφήν</foreign>, &sect; 41), &mdash; their mother having previously or subsequently married the father of Diocles. &mdash; <foreign lang="greek">εἰσποιήσας</foreign>, by forging a <foreign lang="greek">διαθήκη</foreign>: without which, the testator's own children would have inherited (by <foreign lang="greek">ἀγχιστεία</foreign>) before a child born by his wife to another husband. Diocles was driven to this device because an <foreign lang="greek">ἀδελφὴ ὁμομήτριος</foreign> could not marry her half-brother, and therefore he could not obtain any part of the property by marriage with one of the <foreign lang="greek">ἐπίκληροι</foreign>. &mdash; Cp. &sect; 36, where the middle <foreign lang="greek">εἰσποιήσαιτο</foreign> is said of the adopting father.

<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">τῆς δὲ μετ’ ἐκείνην...ἐκείνῳ δέδωκε</lemma> &lsquo;As to the younger <pb n="406"/> sister, he employed a slave to murder her husband, &mdash; got the man [<foreign lang="greek">ἐκεῖνον</foreign>=<foreign lang="greek">τὸν οἰκέτην</foreign>] out of the country, &mdash; threw the guilt on his sister, &mdash; and, having crushed her by his villanies, has further deprived her son &mdash; whose guardian he had become &mdash; of his property, &mdash; keeping the land, and giving his ward a piece of stony ground&rsquo;. &mdash; <foreign lang="greek">καταπλήξας</foreign> refers less to a judicial condemnation than to the helplessness of a cowed and broken spirit: cp.

But <foreign lang="greek">φελλέα</foreign> is acc. sing. of <foreign lang="greek">φελλεύς</foreign>, stony ground. Dobree thinks that <foreign lang="greek">χωρία ἄττα</foreign> arose from a scholion on <foreign lang="greek">φελλέα,   χωρίον ἀττικῶς</foreign>. It may be that we should read <foreign lang="greek">φελλία ἄττα</foreign>, some pieces of stony ground: cp.
