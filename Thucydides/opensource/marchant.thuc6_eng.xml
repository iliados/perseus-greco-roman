<div3 type="SECTION" n="1"><p>  </p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ἐβούλοντο</lemma>&mdash;&lsquo;the word is here (as in Xen. <hi rend="ITALIC">Hel.</hi> III.  4, 2, and elsewhere) used not so much of <hi rend="ITALIC">will</hi> as of <hi rend="ITALIC">intention</hi> (Bloomfield). This is not accurate. Trans. &lsquo;felt a wish.&rsquo;  <foreign lang="greek">βούλομαι</foreign> expresses a vaguer wish than <foreign lang="greek">διανοοῦμαι</foreign>: it never means &lsquo;make up one's mind,&rsquo; and consequently cannot, like <foreign lang="greek">διανοοῦμαι</foreign>, be constructed with a fut. infin.
</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">αὖθις</lemma>&mdash;with <foreign lang="greek">ἐπὶ Σικελίαν πλεύσαντες</foreign>. It is the habit of Thuc. to place the prominent word early in its clause. For the previous A. expeditions see Intr. p. x.
</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">μείζονι παρασκευῇ</lemma>&mdash;the numbers that sailed under Laches are not known. [Pythodorus and] Eurymedon took forty ships with them.
</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">Αάχητος</lemma>&mdash;in Sicily 427-426 B.C.; replaced in winter of 426 by Pythodorus. He was a supporter of Nicias in arranging the peace of 421. Plato's <hi rend="ITALIC">Laches</hi> is named after him. It has been conjectured that he is represented under <hi rend="ITALIC">Tydeus</hi> in the <hi rend="ITALIC">Supplices</hi> of Euripides (produced <hi rend="ITALIC">circ.</hi> 420 B.C.). He is the dog Labes in Aristoph. <hi rend="ITALIC">Wasps.</hi> He was attacked by Cleon.
</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">καί</lemma>&mdash;joins the names of two commanders who were not in power at the same time. Hence the full form would be <foreign lang="greek">τῆς</foreign> <pb n="116"/> <foreign lang="greek">μετὰ Λάχητος καὶ τῆς μετὰ Εὐρ</foreign>.: but it is worth noticing how with the second of two expressions joined by <foreign lang="greek">καί</foreign> it is possible to omit (1) the <hi rend="ITALIC">article</hi>, (2) the <hi rend="ITALIC">preposition.</hi> Such omissions are common even when the connected expressions are quite distinct.
</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">Εὐρυμέδοντος</lemma>&mdash;on returning to Athens from Sicily in 424, he had been tried on a charge of taking bribes (<foreign lang="greek">γραφὴ δώρων</foreign> or <foreign lang="greek">δωροδοκίας</foreign>), and was fined. He was not <foreign lang="greek">στρατηγός</foreign> again until 414 B.C. This long period of retirement is probably connected with his trial and condemnation.
</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ἐπὶ Σ. πλεύσαντες καταστρέψασθαι</lemma>&mdash;it is regular to construct the common object of a partieiple and verb so as to suit the participle.
</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ἄπειροι οἱ πολλοί</lemma>&mdash;in limiting apposition to <foreign lang="greek">Ἀθηναῖοι</foreign>. Thuc. enlarges or contracts the subject at will.
</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">τοῦ μεγέθους . . τοῦ πλήθους</lemma>&mdash;<hi rend="ITALIC">chiasmus</hi> is so common in Thuc. as to amount to a mannerism. Cf. <bibl n="Thuc. 5. 61">V. 61</bibl> <foreign lang="greek">τήν τε τοῦ τείχους ἀσθενείαν καὶ τοῦ στρατοῦ τὸ πλῆθος</foreign>. (On <foreign lang="greek">μέγεθος</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">πλῆθος τῶν ἐνοικούντων</foreign> in reference to the <hi rend="ITALIC">City</hi> see Aristot. <hi rend="ITALIC">Pol.</hi> 1326 a, with Fowler's <hi rend="ITALIC">City-State</hi>, p. 276.)
</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">καὶ ὅτι</lemma>&mdash;a clause introduced by <foreign lang="greek">ὅτι</foreign> in either of its meanings is often co-ordinated to a noun, as in <bibl n="Thuc. 7. 58">VII. 58</bibl>, 4 <foreign lang="greek">διὰ μέγεθός τε πόλεως καὶ ὅτι</foreign> (&lsquo;because&rsquo;) <foreign lang="greek">ἐν μεγίστῳ κινδύνῳ ἦσαν</foreign>. Cf. Demosth. <bibl n="Thuc. 8. 71">VIII. 71</bibl> <foreign lang="greek">οὐδὲν ἂν τούτων εἴτοιμι, ἀλλ̓ ὅτι . . οὐδὲν πολιτεύομαι</foreign>. (1) A similar use of &lsquo;and that&rsquo; is common in eighteenth-centnry English prose; as also is (2) the habit of using together two constructions after a single verb or governing expression&mdash;here <foreign lang="greek">τοῦ μεγέθους . . καὶ ὅτι</foreign> after <foreign lang="greek">ἄπειροι ὄντες</foreign>. Thus in <bibl n="Thuc. 8. 4">VIII. 4</bibl>, 1 we have <foreign lang="greek">παρεσκευάζοντο δὲ . . τήν τε ναυπηγίαν καὶ Σούνιον τειχίσαντες</foreign>: Addison has &lsquo;It was his design <hi rend="ITALIC">to</hi> marry her to such a gentleman, <hi rend="ITALIC">and that</hi> her wedding should be celebrated on such a day&rsquo;; &lsquo;They believe <hi rend="ITALIC">the same</hi> of all works of art . . <hi rend="ITALIC">and that</hi>, as any one of these things perish, their souls go into another world&rsquo;; Cowper has &lsquo;The fine gentleman would find his ceilings too low, <hi rend="ITALIC">and that</hi> his casements admitted too much wind&rsquo;; Johnson, &lsquo;They think veneration gained by such appearances of wisdom, <hi rend="ITALIC">but that</hi> no ideas are annexed to the words.&rsquo; Thackeray, Carlyle, and Ruskin also indulge in this and similar constructions.
</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">οὐ πολλῷ τινι</lemma>&mdash;Hudson wrongly says &lsquo;<foreign lang="greek">τινι</foreign> <hi rend="ITALIC">videtur</hi> <foreign lang="greek">πλεονάζειν</foreign>.&rsquo; Greek has three words for our &lsquo;very,&rsquo; &lsquo;really,&rsquo; or &lsquo;actually&rsquo; (<hi rend="ITALIC">quidam</hi> with adjeetives)&mdash;(1) <foreign lang="greek">τις</foreign> (generally with adjectives of degree); (2) <foreign lang="greek">πάνυ</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">σφόδρα</foreign> (often with words other than numcrals <hi rend="ITALIC">which cannot be compared.</hi> See <hi rend="ITALIC">Class. Rev.</hi> VIII. p. 152<hi rend="ITALIC">b</hi>). With negatives <foreign lang="greek">τις</foreign> or <foreign lang="greek">πάνυ</foreign> or both together can be used. (See Stein on Herod. <bibl n="Thuc. 5. 33">V. 33</bibl>.) <pb n="117"/>
</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ὑποδεἐστερον</lemma>&mdash;antithesis to <foreign lang="greek">μεγέθους καὶ πλήθους</foreign>, as in <bibl n="Thuc. 2. 89">II. 89</bibl>, 6 <foreign lang="greek">ἐκ πολλῷ ὑποδεεστέρων . . μέγα τι τῆς διανοίας τὸ βέβαιον ἔχοντες</foreign>: <bibl n="Thuc. 5. 20">V. 20</bibl> <foreign lang="greek">ὑποδεέστερον ὂν τὰ μέγιστα τιμήσει</foreign>.
</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ἀνῃροῦντο</lemma>&mdash;the pres and imperf., especially of -<foreign lang="greek">γίγνομαι</foreign> and -<foreign lang="greek">δίδωμι</foreign>, often express <hi rend="ITALIC">intention</hi> or <hi rend="ITALIC">attempt;</hi> as Aristoph. <hi rend="ITALIC">Pax</hi> 408 <foreign lang="greek">προδίδοτον τὴν Ἑλλάδα</foreign>: Eur <hi rend="ITALIC">H. F</hi> 538 <foreign lang="greek">καὶ τἄμ’ ἔθνῃσκε τέκν̓, ἀπωλλύμην δ’ ἐγώ</foreign> <hi rend="ITALIC">liberi mei morituri erant, ego autem peritura.</hi></p></div3>
<div3 type="SECTION" n="2"><p>  </p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">Σικελίας</lemma>&mdash;here follows a description of Sicily, in which Thuc., &lsquo;like Herodotus, retains the spirit of the older geographers and logographers,&rsquo; and writes with something of the grace that characterises the style of Herodotus. It has been commonly supposed since Nicbuhr that Thuc. borrows from his contemporary Antiochus of Syracuse&mdash;so Goller, Wolfflin, Classen, Mahaffy,&mdash;but there is no certainty (see Freeman, <hi rend="ITALIC">Hist. Sic.</hi> I. p. 456). Thuc. probably visited Sicily during his exile.
</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ἔλασσον</lemma>&mdash;not <foreign lang="greek">ἐλάσσων</foreign>: the adverbs <foreign lang="greek">πλέον, ἔλασσον</foreign> are regularly used in such cases. Cf. c. 95, 1 <foreign lang="greek">ἐπράθη ταλάντων οὐκ ἔλασσον πέντε καὶ εἴκοσι</foreign>. The repetition of <foreign lang="greek">οὐ πολλῷ τινι</foreign> emphasises the vastness of the undertaking.
</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ἡμερῶν</lemma>&mdash;so <bibl n="Thuc. 2. 97">II. 97</bibl>, 1 <foreign lang="greek">περίπλους τεσσάρων ἡμερῶν</foreign>. The length of the coasts of Sicily is 512 miles. In ancient times, astronomy not being applied to navigation, distance round the coasts of a country of which the measurements were unknown, could be reckoned only by the time occupied in the voyage.
</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">τοσαύτη οὖσα</lemma>&mdash;Thuc. &lsquo;seems to think that there is a geographical incongruity in so large an island being separated from the mainland by so narrow a channel&rsquo; (note in Jowett); or rather, he adds as a second proof of the geographical importance of the island&mdash;and consequently of the magnitude of the new undertaking&mdash;the fact that Sicily, in addition to its size, is so close to the mainland as to be almost part of the continent. Athens was in the habit of reducing islands&mdash; <foreign lang="greek">πλεύσαντες καταστρέψασθαι</foreign>&mdash;but she had not the means for reducing a large <hi rend="ITALIC">continental</hi> country. (Stein explains similarly.)
</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ἐν . . μέτρῳ</lemma>&mdash;a difficult use of <foreign lang="greek">ἑν</foreign> in its <hi rend="ITALIC">quasi</hi>-instrumental sense, &lsquo;<hi rend="ITALIC">res in qua aliqua actio vel qualitas cernitur.</hi>&rsquo; c. 16, 5 <foreign lang="greek">ἔν τινος λαμπρότητι προέσχον</foreign> is the same use. It is from this use that adverbial phrases like <foreign lang="greek">ἐν τάχει</foreign> come.
</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">τὸ μή</lemma>&mdash;Soph. <hi rend="ITALIC">Phil.</hi> 1141 <foreign lang="greek">ἔστιν τις ἔστιν ὅς σε κωλύσει τὸ δρᾶν</foreign>. <hi rend="ITALIC">M.T.</hi> 811: Wecklein on <hi rend="ITALIC">Agam.</hi> 1588. It is <hi rend="ITALIC">internal accus.</hi>
</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">εἶναι</lemma>&mdash;see crit. note. Poppo defended <foreign lang="greek">οὖσα</foreign> here as a confusion between two constructions; but Classen is probably right in thinking that <foreign lang="greek">οὖσα</foreign> got in from <foreign lang="greek">τοσαύτη οὖσα</foreign> above. <pb n="118"/> Among recent critics, only L. Herbst defends <foreign lang="greek">οὖσα</foreign>: he thinks that <foreign lang="greek">τό</foreign> does not affect the construction here and in other places, but is used as a demonstrative particle. Would <foreign lang="greek">μή</foreign> then be possible?</p></div3></div2>
<div2 type="CHAPTER" n="2"><p/>
<div3 type="SECTION" n="1"><p>  </p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ᾠκίσθη δέ</lemma>&mdash;answering to <foreign lang="greek">περίπλους μέν</foreign> above.  cc. 2-5 are generally described as a digression; but the passage is perhaps rather a continuation of the description of the greatness of Sicily. &lsquo;The greatness of Sicily,&rsquo; Freeman says, &lsquo;was essentially a colonial greatness, the greatness of communities which did not form whole nations but only parts of nations, nations of which other parts remained in their elder homes.&rsquo;
</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">τὸ ἀρχαῖον</lemma>&mdash;distinguish from <foreign lang="greek">κατὰ τὸ άρχαῖον</foreign> (&lsquo;in the ancient manner&rsquo;).
</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ἔσχε</lemma>&mdash;sc. <foreign lang="greek">αὐτήν. τὰ ξύμπαντα</foreign> is nom., agreeing with <foreign lang="greek">ἔθνη</foreign>. When the art. precedes <foreign lang="greek">πᾶς</foreign> and its compds., the whole is regarded as the sum of its component parts. (To take <foreign lang="greek">τὰ ξύμπαντα</foreign> as accus. is wrong. A complete list of tribes is what Thuc. gives; their geographical distribution is also described, but that is already referred to in <foreign lang="greek">ὦδε ᾠκίσθη</foreign>. Cf, the last sentence of c. 2, where the same ideas recur in inverse order.)
<foreign lang="greek">λέγονταιλέγομαι</foreign> used personally or impersonally is regularly constructed with an infin.
</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">Κύκλωπες</lemma>&mdash;Homer does not say that the Cyclopes dwelt in Sicily (<hi rend="ITALIC">Od.</hi> IX); but the scene of his story was always localised by later writers (as by Euripides) in Sicily.
</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">Λαιστρυγόνες</lemma>&mdash;mythical beings (<hi rend="ITALIC">Od.</hi> X. 81) like the Cyclopes, dwelling, like them, in fairy-land. The story that they lived in Sicily is the product of Greek fancy. (See Freeman <hi rend="ITALIC">l.c.</hi> pp. 100, 106.)
</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ποιηταῖς</lemma>&mdash;esp. Homer. Observe that the perf. pass., when the subject is non-personal, regularly has the agent in dat.
</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ὡς ἕκαστος γιγνώσκει</lemma>&mdash;so in <bibl n="Thuc. 2. 48">II. 48</bibl>, of the origin of &lsquo;the Plague.&rsquo;
</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">περὶ αὐτῶν</lemma>&mdash;Classen takes <foreign lang="greek">αὐτῶν</foreign> as neut., &lsquo;these questions,&rsquo; <hi rend="ITALIC">i.e.</hi> <foreign lang="greek">γένος, ὁπόθεν ἐσῆλθον κ.τ.λ</foreign>. Of this rather vague use of <foreign lang="greek">αὐτά</foreign> Thuc. is fond. But <foreign lang="greek">μετ’ αὐτούς</foreign> below is strongly in favour of making <foreign lang="greek">αὐτῶν</foreign> masc.</p></div3>
<div3 type="SECTION" n="2"><p>  </p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">Σικανοί</lemma>&mdash;some modern critics, including Holm, think that <foreign lang="greek">Σικανοί</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">Σικελοί</foreign> are &lsquo;simply dialectal differences of the same name.&rsquo; Freeman combats this view <hi rend="ITALIC">l.c.</hi> pp. 472 <hi rend="ITALIC">fol.</hi>
</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ἐνοικισάμενοι</lemma>&mdash;&lsquo;settled there.&rsquo; The next words mean &lsquo;or rather (<foreign lang="greek">καί</foreign>=<hi rend="ITALIC">immo</hi>) before them, according to their own account.&rsquo; There is an instance of the sarcastic humour of <pb n="119"/> which Thuc. is rather fond in <foreign lang="greek">ἐνοικισάμενοι . . αὐτόχθονες</foreign>: if &lsquo;original inhabitants,&rsquo; they could not be &lsquo;settlers.&rsquo;
</p>

<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ὡς μὲν αὐτοί φασι</lemma>&mdash;this is placed early in order to bring out the antithesis sharply. It is a very common trick of order in Thuc.
</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">διὰ τὸ . . εἶναι</lemma>&mdash;the inf. with <foreign lang="greek">διὰ τό</foreign> is very common in Thuc. (63 cases according to Behrendt), but <foreign lang="greek">διὰ τοῦ</foreign> with inf. is not found. The inf. with art., commoner in Thuc. and Demosth. than in any other author, is in Thuc. found chiefly in the speeches and the loftier parts of narrative. The construction and usage of the Eng. inf. in -<hi rend="ITALIC">ing</hi> (as distinct from the <hi rend="ITALIC">verbal noun</hi>) are precisely similar to the Gk. inf. with art., except only that the Eng. inf. can be qualified, not only by the def. art., but by a pronoun and by a substantive in the possessive case.
</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">Ἴβηρες</lemma>&mdash;great value attached to a well-authenticated claim to be <foreign lang="greek">αὐτόχθονες</foreign>: hence Thuc. marks the antithesis to <foreign lang="greek">διὰ τὸ αύ. εἶναι</foreign>, instead of writing <foreign lang="greek">ὕστεροι</foreign> in contrast with <foreign lang="greek">πρότεροι</foreign>. Stein reads &lt;<foreign lang="greek">ὕστεροι</foreign>&gt;,  <foreign lang="greek">Ἴβηρες</foreign>.
</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">Σικανοῦ</lemma>&mdash;has been thought to be the S&egrave;gre or even the Seine, but it is unknown. It is not certain from what quarter these Iberians really immigrated to Sicily.
14 </p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">Τρινακρία</lemma>&mdash;Freeman points out that this name, derived from <foreign lang="greek">τρεῖς ἄκραι</foreign>, is probably a mere corruption of the Homeric <foreign lang="greek">Θρινακίη</foreign>, with which island Sicily was identified, the supposed reference being to the triangular shape of Sicily. Ov. <hi rend="ITALIC">Fast.</hi> <bibl n="Thuc. 4. 419">IV. 419</bibl> <hi rend="ITALIC">Trinacris a positu nomen adepta loci.</hi>
</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">καλουμένη</lemma>&mdash;this tense of the partic. (imperf.) is invariably used when a name now obsolete is referred to. <foreign lang="greek">κληθείς</foreign>= &lsquo;called&rsquo; (timeless), or &lsquo;having received the name,&rsquo; and is used of names given under some definite circumstances referred to, as in c. 4, 1 <foreign lang="greek">τοὺς Ὑ. κληθέντας</foreign>, and c. 4, 5.
</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">τὰ πρὸς ἑσπέραν</lemma>&mdash;adverbial. For the expression cf. <foreign lang="greek">τὰ πρὸς βορρᾶν</foreign> &sect; 5 and <foreign lang="greek">τὸ πρὸς νότον</foreign> <bibl n="Thuc. 3. 6">III. 6</bibl>. <foreign lang="greek">πρὸς ἑσπέραν</foreign> also means &lsquo;towards evening,&rsquo; <hi rend="ITALIC">sub vesperum.</hi></p></div3>
<div3 type="SECTION" n="3"><p>  </p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ἁλισκομένου</lemma>&mdash;Classen makes this historic pres.; but it cannot be shown that the historic pres. is used in any mood but the indic. Stahl takes it with <foreign lang="greek">διαφυγόντες</foreign>&mdash;&lsquo;escaped at the time of the capture.&rsquo; This is possible; but Goodwin (<hi rend="ITALIC">M.T.</hi> &sect; 27) classes <foreign lang="greek">ἁλίσκομαι</foreign> with <foreign lang="greek">ἀδικῶ, φεύγω, νικῶ</foreign>, etc., so that the pres. may here resemble a perf.: but observe (1) when the pres. indic. of <foreign lang="greek">ἁλ</foreign>. refers to the past, it appears to he <hi rend="ITALIC">historic pres.;</hi> (2) <foreign lang="greek">ἁλισκόμενος</foreign> is either (<hi rend="ITALIC">a</hi>) coincident in time with the main verb, or (<hi rend="ITALIC">b</hi>) approaches to the perf., like <foreign lang="greek">άδικῶ</foreign>. (An <hi rend="ITALIC">imperf.</hi> <pb n="120"/> partic. in gen. abs. joined to a historic pres. sometimes gives the <hi rend="ITALIC">cause</hi> of the verb; as <bibl n="Thuc. 1. 136">I. 136</bibl> <foreign lang="greek">δεδιέναι φασκόντων Κερκυραίων ἔχειν αὐτόν, διακομίζεται ἐς τὴν ἤπειρον</foreign>.)
</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ἀφικνοῦνται</lemma>&mdash;verbs of &lsquo;going&rsquo; and &lsquo;sending&rsquo; are especially common in the hist. pres.
</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ξύμπαντες μέν</lemma>&mdash;Jowett renders &lsquo;they settled near the Sicanians, and both took the name of Elymi&rsquo;; but Freeman says &lsquo;I certainly always understood this simply to mean that the whole people were called E. . . . but that there were two separate Elymian cities.&rsquo; Freeman is clearly right. The Sicanians had given their name to the island, and they remained quite distinct from the Elymi. Also, is J.'s rendering of <foreign lang="greek">ξύμπαντες</foreign> possible? <foreign lang="greek">ξ</foreign>. is often contrasted with <foreign lang="greek">κατὰ πόλεις</foreign>, whereas it <hi rend="ITALIC">never</hi> means in Thuc. &lsquo;they with the others.&rsquo; And Thuc. is clearly giving the name and the cities of the new settlers.
</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">Ἔρυξ</lemma>&mdash;the story of the Trojan origin of Eryx is accepted and elaborated by Virgil m Aeneid V.; but Freeman shows that the older legend did not assign to it a Trojan origin.
</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">Ἔγεστα</lemma>&mdash;this is the Greek name; but the native name, retained by the Romans, was Segesta. It is the Acesta of <hi rend="ITALIC">Aen.</hi> <bibl n="Thuc. 5. 718">v. 718</bibl>. To the Romans is due the tradition that it was founded by Aeneas, who named it after Acestes.
</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">προσξυνῴκησαν δὲ . . καί</lemma>&mdash;a characteristic <hi rend="ITALIC">anaphora</hi> of <foreign lang="greek">ὅμοροι . . οἰκήσαντες</foreign>. Thuc. does not <hi rend="ITALIC">in narrative</hi> balance the clauses exactly by <hi rend="ITALIC">anaphora</hi>, whereas in Xenophon such balance is very frequent. Cp. c. 20, 4.
</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">Φωκέων</lemma>&mdash;the statement that Phocians settled in Sicily receives no support except from a single passage in Pausanias. And this testimony is really of slight value, as P. is enumerating the Greek settlers in Sicily, as distinct from the barbarians, among whom he places the Elymi (Phrygians, <hi rend="ITALIC">i.e</hi> Trojans). The correction <foreign lang="greek">Φρυγῶν</foreign> is not really supported, because when later writers speak of Phrygians in Sicily they mean Trojans. It looks as if in <foreign lang="greek">τῶν Τρώων τινές</foreign> above Thue. refers to that arrival which appears under a much-developed form in Dion. Hal. as the return of Acestes. Whether in <foreign lang="greek">Φωκέων τινές</foreign> we have an early form of the legend that reappears in the story of Aeneas, is much more doubtful. Dion. Hal. assigns an Areadian origin to Aeneas: and it should be borne in mind that the Trojans are barbarians in Thuc. and Pausanias, but Hellenes in Dion. Hal. and Virgil. Dion. Hal. speaks of the Trojans under Aeneas as <foreign lang="greek">τὰς πόλεις συνοικίζοντες τοῖς Ἐλύμοις έν Σικελίᾳ</foreign>. These faets only show how great was the confusion <pb n="121"/> in the stories concerning the settlement of the Elymi, and how impossible it is to correct <foreign lang="greek">Φωκέων</foreign> with any confidenee.
</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">τότε</lemma>&mdash;refers back to <foreign lang="greek">διαφυγόντες</foreign> (Stahl).
</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ἐς Λιβύην</lemma>&mdash;it is not impossible that this suggested to Virgil the bringing of Aeneas to Carthage.
<foreign lang="greek">πρῶτον, ἔπειταπρῶτον</foreign> without <foreign lang="greek">μέν</foreign> is always followed by <foreign lang="greek">ἔπειτα</foreign> without <foreign lang="greek">δἐ</foreign>, unless <foreign lang="greek">καί</foreign> follows <foreign lang="greek">ἔπειτα</foreign>, when <foreign lang="greek">δέ</foreign> is always added, as in <bibl n="Thuc. 7. 23">VII. 23</bibl> <foreign lang="greek">τὸ μέγιστον πρῶτον, ἔπειτα δὲ καί κτλ</foreign>.
</p>

Hence, to show that it was by sea that the Gks. came, and not by migration from their settlements&mdash;the sea being all-important in the struggle between Gk. and Phoenician &mdash;<foreign lang="greek">κατὰ θ</foreign> is naturally added.

<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">Μοτύην</lemma>&mdash;an island about five miles N. of Lilybaeum. It was joined to the mainland by a mole, which, though under water, is still used as a track. In 397 the Carthaginians were driven from Motye by Dionysius and founded Lilybaeum.
</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">Σολόεντα</lemma>&mdash;Soloeis, the Roman Soluntum, became the eastern stronghold of the Phoenicians against the Greeks. It was a fortress, not a mere trading station. The present remains go back only to Roman times.

<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ξυνοικήσαντες</lemma>&mdash;Stahl points out that this is contrasted with <foreign lang="greek">ᾤκουν περὶ π. τὴν Σ</foreign>. The three towns were not new settlements of the Phoenicians.

<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">καὶ ὅτι</lemma>&mdash;cf. c. 1, 1. Two causes are constantly given in different constructions by Thuc.; a clause with <foreign lang="greek">ὅτι</foreign> is sometimes joined to a prep. (<foreign lang="greek">διά, κατά, πρός</foreign>) and case.
</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">Καρχηδών</lemma>&mdash;the tradition generally accepted at a later time was that Rome and Carthage were founded on the same day; but there is good evidence that Carthage was founded shortly before 800 B.C.

<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ὅστις</lemma>&mdash;a strange use of <foreign lang="greek">ὅστις</foreign>, the ordinary rules for which as a relative are as follows:&mdash;1.

Referring to a <hi rend="ITALIC">definite</hi> antecedent: (a)=<hi rend="ITALIC">quippe qui.</hi> (b)=<hi rend="ITALIC">of the kind that, any that.</hi> It has been supposed that Thuc. took at least this note from Antiochus of Syracuse, because Dion. Hal. <bibl n="Thuc. 1. 12">I. 12</bibl> quotes from him the expression <foreign lang="greek">τὴν γῆν ταύτην ἥτις νῦν Ἰταλία καλεῖται</foreign>, and the inference is that Antiochus used <foreign lang="greek">ὅστις</foreign> for <foreign lang="greek">ὅς</foreign>. On the other hand, Dion. Hal. is scarcely to be trusted in a minute linguistic point, and it is strange that Thuc., even though he may have used Antiochus, should follow him in such a use of <foreign lang="greek">ὅστις</foreign>. Stein on Herod. <bibl n="Thuc. 4. 8">IV. 8</bibl> collects exx. of <foreign lang="greek">ὅστις</foreign> for <foreign lang="greek">ὅς</foreign> after <foreign lang="greek">οὗτος</foreign> in Herod. We may compare with this the use of <foreign lang="greek">σφῶν</foreign> in Thuc. for <foreign lang="greek">ἑαυτῶν</foreign> or <foreign lang="greek">σφῶν αὐτῶν</foreign>, and of <foreign lang="greek">ὅδε, τοιόσδε, τοσόσδε</foreign> referring to what precedes (cf. c. 2 end). All these uses are charaeteristic of Ionic rather than of Attic.
</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">τῆς πόλεως</lemma>&mdash;Naxos no longer existed after 403 B.C., and Tanromenium did not stand on the same site. Hence this appears to have been written before 403.

<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ἀποθνῄσκει</lemma>&mdash;the historic pres., esp. common with such verbs as <foreign lang="greek">τίκτω, γίγνομαι, θνῄσκω</foreign>, may be co-ordinated with another tense&mdash;<foreign lang="greek">ᾤκισαν</foreign>&mdash;which may equally well precede or follow it.
</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">παραδόντος</lemma>&mdash;Freeman says: &lsquo;The M. were helped by a Sikel king who betrayed the place to them&rsquo;; but Stahl with the older edd rightly explains <foreign lang="greek">τὴν χώραν</foreign> as the region in which M. was situated. Bloomfield, keeping the MSS. <foreign lang="greek">προδόντος</foreign>, renders &lsquo;having conceded,&rsquo; and probably Hyblon granted the land because he was unable to defend it. Classen's correction <foreign lang="greek">παρα</foreign>- is almost certain, being in accordance with the language of Thuc., whereas <foreign lang="greek">προ- τὴν χώραν</foreign> is a most unusual phrase.

<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">Μεγαρέας</lemma>&mdash;the city, which was never important, was destroyed by Gelon (see c. 5, 3), but was rebuilt after the Sicilian expedition and made an outpost of Syracuse. Gelon had intervened in a civil war at Megara. (The single sentence of which this section consists illustrates the great power of the Gk. participle. <foreign lang="greek">οἰκίσας καὶ ξυμπολιτεύσας καὶ ἐκπεσὼν καὶ οἰκίσας</foreign> <pb n="128"/> expresses a succession of events that are detailed in the briefest and simplest form of words possible. The style is periodic, though the period is not worked up in the rhetorical manner. Observe that <foreign lang="greek">τε</foreign> belongs to the first <foreign lang="greek">καί</foreign>, the two longer participial phrases making one pair, and the two shorter a second pair. Although this cumulation of participles is of course impossible in English, yet the outline of the whole sentence resembles the modern English period, strictly so ealled, rather than the more artificial Gk. period.)</p></div3>

<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">χωρίον</lemma>&mdash;Freeman says: &lsquo;It would seem that Gela was a later, perhaps in its beginning only a popular, name. To the first spot which the Rhodian settlers occupied and fortified, the spot which became the akropolis of the later city, they gave, in memory of one of the four cities of their own island, the name of Lindioi.&rsquo; Cf. Herod. <bibl n="Thuc. 7. 153">VII. 153</bibl> <foreign lang="greek">κτιζομένης Γέλης ὑπὸ Λινδίων τῶν ἐκ rόδου</foreign>.

<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">καὶ ὅ</lemma>&mdash;&lsquo;<hi rend="ITALIC">attende rariorem syntaxin</hi>,&rsquo; says Stahl. It would be more usual if <foreign lang="greek">ὅ</foreign> were omitted.

<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">καλεῦται</lemma>&mdash;B was thought to have originally contained <foreign lang="greek">καλοῦνται</foreign>, but this seems doubtful. Herw., in support of the plur., quotes <bibl n="Thuc. 4. 102">IV. 102</bibl> <foreign lang="greek">τὸ χωρίον τοῦτο, ὅπερ πρότερον Ἐννέα ὁδοὶ ἐκαλοῦντο</foreign>, <bibl n="Thuc. 5. 49">V. 49</bibl> <foreign lang="greek">ἡ καταδίκη δισχίλιαι μναῖ ἦσαν</foreign> But it is clear that the verb is not necessarily plur: cf.

There is nothing against the assumption that before Athenian influence was felt in Rhodes, the Dorian institutions had prevailed. In later times the constitution of the island was generally democratie. The family of the Eratidae, who formed a Dorian aristocracy in Ialysus, were banished between B.C. 428 and 412.</p></div3>

Corinth stood ont of the Peace.
Autnmn of 421, Corinth initiated a new leagne under Argos, <bibl n="Thuc. 5. 27">v. 27</bibl>, on the ground that Sparta was arming at &lsquo;enslaving the Peloponnese.&rsquo;
In May 420 Athens concluded an alliance with Argos, Elis, and Mantinea; from this Corinth held aloof, <bibl n="Thuc. 5. 48">v. 48</bibl>, and was inclined to join Sparta.
In 418 Corinth joined Sparta against Argos, <bibl n="Thuc. 5. 58">v. 58</bibl>.
But Corinth was never a cordial ally of Sparta after 421.

His relations with Athens are not elearly explained by Thuc., and the omission is serious, as we cannot without such explanation understand fully the political position in the north-cast. The following table is compiled from Thuc.:&mdash;
(1) Perdiecas was in alliance with Athens before 432.
(2) In 432 he encouraged Potidaea to revolt.
(3) 431: reconciliation with Athens.
(4) 429: Athens projected an expedition against him.
In 427 and 425 we know from inscriptions that Athens negotiated with him to prevent him from injuring Methone.
(5) 424: he encouraged Brasidas to go to the north.
(6) 424 autumn: he made terms with Athens.
(7) 418: he joined Sparta after Mantinea. 417: the Athenians blockaded him ineffectually.

What we <hi rend="ITALIC">are</hi> doing is quite different from what we <hi rend="ITALIC">ought</hi> to be doing.

The enthymeme, which is very common in the speeches of Thuc., is &lsquo;a syllogism drawn, not from the premisses proper to any particular seience&mdash;such as medicine&mdash;but from propositions relating to contingent things in the sphere of human action&rsquo; (Jebb): thus here:&mdash;<hi rend="ITALIC">proposition</hi> 1, we aid Segesta; <hi rend="ITALIC">proposition</hi> 2, we neglect our revolted subjects. The inference is that we are neglecting the city's interest in not reducing the revolted to obedience. The most approved form of <hi rend="ITALIC">enthymeme</hi> according to later rhetoricians is this, which Cieero calls <hi rend="ITALIC">sententia ex contrariis conclusa: e.g.</hi> Cic. <hi rend="ITALIC">pro Sulla</hi> &sect; 22 <hi rend="ITALIC">an vero clarissimum virum generis vestri ac nominis nemo reprehendit qui filium suum vita privavit . . : tu rempublicam reprehendis, quae domesticos hostes . . necavit?</hi> One of the two premisses is often omitted, in which case the <hi rend="ITALIC">enthymeme</hi> becomes a mere statement backed up with a single reason.</p></div3></div2>

Failure to capture a city by assault or siege was an experience of the Athenians: it had not hitherto led to <pb n="142"/> disastrous consequences.

<div3 type="SECTION" n="2"><p>  </p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">Σικελιῶται δ’ ἄν κτλ</lemma>&mdash;this is explained in two ways: (1) After <foreign lang="greek">ὥς γε νῦν ἔχουσι</foreign> supply <foreign lang="greek">οὐ δεινοὶ εἶναι</foreign> by an ellipse such as Herbst thinks characteristic of Thuc. and calls &lsquo;beautiful.&rsquo; Clas. thinks that there is a lacuna after <foreign lang="greek">ἔχουσι</foreign>. The Schol. and others support this view. Cf. note in Jowett. (2) &lsquo;Looking at the actual state of Sicily, I should say that the island would be even less formidable to us&rsquo;: so Arnold, Bloomf., Stahl, etc. This version misses the antithesis between <foreign lang="greek">ὤς γε νῦν ἔχουσι</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">εἰ ἄρξειαν</foreign> which is carried on in <foreign lang="greek">νῦν . . ἐκείνως</foreign>. Now it is not certain that <foreign lang="greek">νῦν μὲν γάρ</foreign> . . is epexegetic of <foreign lang="greek">ὤς γε νῦν ἔχουσι</foreign>: for <foreign lang="greek">καὶ ἔτι ἂν ἧσσον</foreign> may quite well=<foreign lang="greek">καὶ ἔτι ἂν ἧσσον ἢ νῦν εἰσι</foreign>. The real difficulty is to settle the meaning of <foreign lang="greek">ὤς . . ἔχουσι</foreign>. According to Stahl &lsquo;the present state of the S.&rsquo; means &lsquo;their state while they are independent.&rsquo; Much more probably &lsquo;uninvaded as they are by us&rsquo; is the sense. Should we invade Sicily, the conditions would be altered. If we won, we should not gain: if we lost, then Syracuse might get the upper hand, and of course then would join Sparta.

<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ἕκαστοι</lemma>&mdash;&lsquo;separately.&rsquo; The statement is put vaguely, because after the experience of Sparta with regard to her Sicilian allies there could not be much ground for Athens to fear that the Siceliots, <hi rend="ITALIC">if undisturbed</hi>, would send help to Sparta.

Nicias himself in <bibl n="Thuc. 7. 61">VII. 61</bibl> expresses a hope that <foreign lang="greek">τὸ τῆς τύχης</foreign> may side with the Athenians: he seems to think that the conduct of the gods may be reasoned about (<bibl n="Thuc. 7. 77">VII. 77</bibl>, 4), but that <foreign lang="greek">τύχη</foreign> is unaccountable.

If <foreign lang="greek">τὰς δ</foreign>. goes with <foreign lang="greek">κρατήσαντας</foreign>, it is strange <pb n="144"/> that the gen. is not used, in accordance with the otherwise invariable rule of Thuc., except when <foreign lang="greek">μάχη</foreign> is expressed or implied. Clas, takes <foreign lang="greek">τὰς δ</foreign>. as accus. of &lsquo;respect,&rsquo; and supplies <foreign lang="greek">αὐτῶν</foreign> to <foreign lang="greek">κρατήσαντας</foreign>. It is better to take <foreign lang="greek">τὰς διανοίας</foreign> as object of <foreign lang="greek">θαρσεῖν</foreign>, and to render &lsquo;to defeat (the enemy) and (then) to have no fear of his (further) plans.&rsquo; For the sentiment, cf.

If <foreign lang="greek">λύειν τοὺς νόμους κτλ</foreign>. means, as is usually supposed, &lsquo;to act illegally will not involve blame,&rsquo; it is extraordinary that Alc. in his reply should make no use of the most obvious argument against rescinding the decree. But N. probably only means that the president might have some doubt whether it was legal <foreign lang="greek">ἀναψηφίσαι</foreign>, and not that he himself thought the action would be illegal.

It is supposed that Alc. is speaking sarcastically, <hi rend="ITALIC">himself</hi> meaning rather the old by <foreign lang="greek">φαῦλον</foreign>. But all this ingenuity is needless.

The lit. rendering is &lsquo;we are about to make a voyage to serve in a campaign not as you served, where among your subjects here you attacked any one as allies.&rsquo; The contrast is between an offensive alliance near home and an offensive alliance in a distant country; and the difference lies in the <hi rend="ITALIC">placc.</hi> When the neighbourhood is friendly, there is no such difficulty as will be encountered in Sicily. <foreign lang="greek">ξύμμαχοι</foreign> does not mean that A. was in the habit of making an alliance <hi rend="ITALIC">specially</hi> to attack a place (as Aruold thought), but is used for the sake of the antithesis of the <hi rend="ITALIC">ordinary</hi> relation existing between A. and her <foreign lang="greek">ὑπήκοοι</foreign>, which is <foreign lang="greek">ξυμμαχία</foreign>, with the <hi rend="ITALIC">unusual</hi> <foreign lang="greek">ξυμμαχία</foreign> in Sicily.

The word is explained by the Schol.: <foreign lang="greek">ἀπαρτηθέντες, ἀπελθόντες, καὶ πολὺ τῆς οἰκείας χωρισθέντες</foreign>. The only passage that supports the supposed intrans. use of the act. is Dio Cass. 51, 4, 2 quoted by Pape and Clas. Now to <foreign lang="greek">ἀπαρτήσαντες</foreign> supply <foreign lang="greek">ἀπὸ τῆς ἡμετέρας αὐτῶν</foreign> from above&mdash;the main point being that the armament is separated from, cut off from home, and transferred to a distant land. Thus <foreign lang="greek">ἐς . . ἀπαρτήσαντες</foreign> repeats with an addition <foreign lang="greek">πολὺ . . μέλλομεν πλεῖν</foreign>. The <hi rend="ITALIC">object</hi> of <foreign lang="greek">ἀπαρτήσαντες</foreign> (<foreign lang="greek">τὴν παρασκευήν</foreign>) is implied in the preceding words, and its omission is no more than the ordinary omission of an object with military words.

He puts the case in its worst light. Should it be required to send at beginning of winter, it would be difficult for a messenger to go, and he might have to wait for spring, or put into an Italian or even a Libyan port for refuge. The months are Maimacteriou, Posideon, Gamelion, Anthesterion, corresponding roughly to November, December, January, and February, and they are taken not singly, but as together making up the time when voyaging was dangerous.</p></div3></div2>

<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">αὐτοί</lemma>&mdash;belougs in seuse to <foreign lang="greek">ἀντίπαλον παρασκευασάμενοι</foreign>: &lsquo;with a force of our own not merely equal to that of the enemy&rsquo; (Jowett).
</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">πλήν γε</lemma>&mdash;if <foreign lang="greek">τὸ ὁπλιτικόν</foreign> is made part of the parenthesis, the meauing is open to grave doubt. (<hi rend="ITALIC">a</hi>) The note in Jowett explains: &lsquo;While exhorting the A., he is secretly discouraging them. &ldquo;You must do all you can to be a match for your opponents&rdquo; is the general drift of the previous chapter, and yet he throws in by the way, &ldquo;but in the great arm of war [the hoplites] you caunot be a match for them.&rdquo;&rsquo; But (1) Nicias nowhere introduces this disparity of hoplites, of which so much might have been made as an argument against the expedition. (2) How, after an exception so vital, could he add <foreign lang="greek">ὑπερβάλλοντες τοῖς πᾶσι</foreign>? (3) How in c. 31 could Thuc. say of the A. force that its superiority over that of the euemy was conspicuous, if in the great arm of war N. can assert that it will of course be inferior? Would not such a statement from a responsible general be ridiculous? (<hi rend="ITALIC">b</hi>) Classen makes <foreign lang="greek">τὸ ὁπλιτικόν</foreign> refer to the A. hoplites, and makes the sense &lsquo;except as regards our hoplites as compared with their whole fighting force&rsquo;; but Stahl rightly objects that the comparison <hi rend="ITALIC">should then</hi> be between <hi rend="ITALIC">part</hi> and <hi rend="ITALIC">part</hi>, not between <hi rend="ITALIC">part</hi> and <hi rend="ITALIC">whole</hi>, of the rival forces. The remedy is not to read <foreign lang="greek">τὸ ἱππικόν</foreign> with Urlichs,&mdash;for N. had proposed to take a force of <foreign lang="greek">σφενδονῆται</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">τοξόται</foreign> which should be <foreign lang="greek">ἀντίπαλον</foreign> to the enemy's cavalry,&mdash;but to make <foreign lang="greek">τὸ ὁπλιτικόν</foreign> the object of <foreign lang="greek">παρας κευασάμενοι</foreign>. Hence trans. &lsquo;not only with a <pb n="162"/> force of hoplites a match for them, except when compared with their fighting strength (i e. with our hoplites equal to their hoplites), but actually surpassing them in every point.
</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">τὸ μάχιμον αὐτῶν</lemma>&mdash;this is the whole of the enemy's forces. The A. were in the habit of relying on their hoplites in the field: N. reminds them that there are other kinds of troops to be reckoned with besides hoplites. He is referring back to his remark in c. 22, 1. Not only must the hoplites be a match for them (excluding of course their cavalry), but hoplites <hi rend="ITALIC">and light-armed troops</hi> must be <hi rend="ITALIC">more than a match</hi> for their whole fighting force, and even thus it will be hard to deal with them. <foreign lang="greek">τὸ ὁπλιτικόν</foreign> is in an emphatic position, because it is contrasted with <foreign lang="greek">τὸ ἐκείνων ὶππικόν</foreign>, as in c. 22.
</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ὑπερβάλλοντες</lemma>&mdash;the antithesis between this and <foreign lang="greek">ἀντίπαλον παρασκευασάμενοι τὸ ὁπλιτικὸν πλήν γε πρὸς τὸ μάχιμον αὐτῶν</foreign> is more formal than real: for the former words already imply that the A. hoplite force taken separately will be superior to the enemy's hoplite force taken separately.
</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">τοῖς πᾶσι</lemma>&mdash;<hi rend="ITALIC">omnibus rebus.</hi> Of course A. cavalry are excepted after what has been said in c. 22.
<foreign lang="greek">τῶν μὲν κρατεῖν, τὰ δὲ καὶ διασῶσαιτῶν μέν</foreign> is neut.; but different explanations are given of the meaning. (<hi rend="ITALIC">a</hi>) Stahl renders &lsquo;aliis potiri, alia (quibus potiti erimus) etiam in tuto locare,&rsquo; thus referring both <foreign lang="greek">τῶν μέν</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">τὰ δέ</foreign> to the enemy; &lsquo;to seize on some positions and to hold permanently others&rsquo; (Wilkins). (<hi rend="ITALIC">b</hi>) Classen accepts the Scholiast's note: <foreign lang="greek">τῶν μέν</foreign>=<foreign lang="greek">τῶν ἐκεῖ πραγμάτων, τὰ δέ</foreign>=<foreign lang="greek">τὰ οἰκεῖα</foreign>; &lsquo;to conquer Sicily, or indeed to preserve ourselves&rsquo; (Jowett). That (<hi rend="ITALIC">b</hi>) is right is shown by the sentence that follows. It will be hard, says N., to conquer what we require to conquer, and even to preserve what we require to preserve: we should consider ourselves to be men who have to found a city in a hostile land&mdash;who have to fight for the soil&mdash; <foreign lang="greek">τῶν μὲν κρατεῖν</foreign>&mdash;and to protect what we bring&mdash;<foreign lang="greek">τὰ δὲ καὶ διασῶσαι</foreign>.

But the sense is &lsquo;immediate (and certain) dependence which involves no risk,&rsquo; in contrast with the hope of avoiding subjection to Athens by facing the risk involved in fighting with Syracuse. &lsquo;If you refuse to join, you escape danger but accept dependence: if you consent, you accept danger but escape dependence.&rsquo; Hence both <foreign lang="greek">αὐτίκα</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">ἀκινδύνως</foreign> qualify <foreign lang="greek">δουλεία</foreign>. Cf. <bibl n="Thuc. 1. 22">I. 22</bibl> <foreign lang="greek">ἡ ἄντικρυς ἐλευθερία</foreign>, <bibl n="Thuc. 8. 64">VIII. 64</bibl> <foreign lang="greek">ἡ ἄντικρυς ἐλευθερία</foreign>, and perhaps <foreign lang="greek">στρατιὰ ἔτι</foreign> = &lsquo;remforcements,&rsquo; though when no art. is present the adv. belongs in some measure to the verb.

(The edd. have, I believe, missed the meaning of this sentence. For the alterations of the text see the crit. note. The old explanation, that <foreign lang="greek">αὐτῶν</foreign> is a repetition of <foreign lang="greek">Πελοποννησίοις</foreign> in a different case by anacoluthon, is quite untenable. Herbst believes there is an ellipse of <foreign lang="greek">πολέμιοι</foreign>, but I do not see the need of this.)

It refers to the personal characteristics of a people, and the mention of it here is to show that it may be <hi rend="ITALIC">substituted</hi> for <foreign lang="greek">πολυπραγμοσύνη</foreign>, so that <foreign lang="greek">καί</foreign> =<hi rend="ITALIC">immo.</hi> There is also a reference baek to <foreign lang="greek">ἀποτρέπειν</foreign> (<foreign lang="greek">τῶν ποιουμένων</foreign>) above, which is thus <foreign lang="greek">ἀποτρέπειν τοῦ τρόπου</foreign>. The <foreign lang="greek">τρόποι</foreign> of the Athenians are fully dealt with by Pericles in the Funeral Oration.
<foreign lang="greek">τούτῳ ἀπολαβόντες χρήσασθετοῦτο</foreign> would be the more ordinary construction; see c 46, 3, but cf. <bibl n="Thuc. 8. 87">VIII. 87</bibl> <foreign lang="greek">ὄπως μηδετέρους προσθέμενος ἰσχυροτάτους ποιήσῃ</foreign>. The partic. in such cases may be regarded as absolute.

<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ἐν παντὶ γὰρ κτλ</lemma>&mdash;&lsquo;in every place, even where we are not at hand, the man who thinks that he will suffer wrong and he who plots mischief&mdash;because they have a lively expecta<pb n="231"/> tion, the one of obtaining from us a return in the form of help, the other that if we come he will be in danger of suffering for his wrong&mdash;are both alike compelled, the one to restram himself against his will, the other to accept safety without taking action.&rsquo; In this extremely difficult passage the speaker explains the effect of Athenian <hi rend="ITALIC">prestige</hi>&mdash;that <hi rend="ITALIC">prestige</hi> which arises from her <foreign lang="greek">πολυπραγμοσύνη</foreign>. It is a guarantee of tranquillity in states in which Athens has no footing. And how? Because the certainty of her intervention on behalf of the oppressed prevents attempts at oppression. This theory is similar to the modern theory that great armaments are a guarantee of peace.

<foreign lang="greek">ἀντιτυχεῖνἀντι-</foreign>, as a return for joining our alliance, for frankly accepting our interference. (This is better than Haack's explanation, adopted by Stahl, that <foreign lang="greek">ἀντι-</foreign> =&lsquo;in redress of the wrong,&rsquo; because it is more in accordance with the advice that is being given to Camarina <foreign lang="greek">χρήσασθαι τῇ πολυπραγμοσύνῃ</foreign>.)

<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">μὴ ἀδεεῖ εἶναι κινδυνεύειν</lemma>&mdash;on the reading see crit. note. (<hi rend="ITALIC">a</hi>) <foreign lang="greek">κινδυνεύειν</foreign> depending on <foreign lang="greek">μὴ ἀδεεῖ</foreign>. Stahl rightly objects to Classen's rendering &lsquo;that he will have to fear a conflict with us,&rsquo; on the ground that the inf. <foreign lang="greek">κινδυνεύειν</foreign> is most unusual in the sense <foreign lang="greek">μὴ κινδυνεύῃ</foreign>, and that <foreign lang="greek">ἀδεής</foreign> does not mean &lsquo;liable to fear&rsquo; but actually &lsquo;afraid.&rsquo; Others render &lsquo;that they will not be without fear of danger&rsquo;; but Stahl says this puts the point very feebly: not the chance that they <hi rend="ITALIC">may</hi> be in danger, but only the <hi rend="ITALIC">certainty</hi> of danger if the Athenians intervene, would deter men from plotting; <foreign lang="greek">κινδυνεύειν</foreign> greatly weakens the passage. (<hi rend="ITALIC">b</hi>) <foreign lang="greek">μὴ ἀδεεῖ εἶναι</foreign> depending on <foreign lang="greek">κινδυν εύειν</foreign>. Then the rendering given by edd. is &lsquo;will be likely to have reason for fear.&rsquo; But (1) nowhere else in Thuc. does <foreign lang="greek">κινδυνεύειν</foreign>=&lsquo;to be likely&rsquo;; (2) the sense given to <foreign lang="greek">ἀδεής</foreign> is weak. It remains to give to <foreign lang="greek">ἀδεής</foreign> its <hi rend="ITALIC">legal</hi> meaning, &lsquo;exempt from punishment,&rsquo; &lsquo;privileged, though guilty,&rsquo; for which see c. 27, 2. This suits <foreign lang="greek">ἀδικήσεσθαι</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">ἐπιβουλεύειν</foreign>, and gives a forcible meaning to the passage. See Intr. &sect; 23.

<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">τοῦ ξύμπαντος</lemma>&mdash;not merely <foreign lang="greek">τοῦ δήμου</foreign>: they were for the constitution, and were no mere party leaders. In the case of some of the Alcmaeonidae there is truth in this, but Alc. was not a party leader only because he pursued a purely selfish policy. He is not even mentioned in the <hi rend="ITALIC">Ath.

<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">καί</lemma> implies &lsquo;in addition to having received it as an inheritance,&rsquo; and the words are sarcastic, meaning &lsquo;we knew too much about it to approve of it.&rsquo;

<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">καὶ αἰτὸς ἂν κτλ</lemma>&mdash;<hi rend="ITALIC">i.e.</hi> <foreign lang="greek">καὶ αὐτὸς οὐδενὸς ἂν χεῖρον φρονοίην, ὅσῳ κἂν λοιδορήσαιμι</foreign>, &lsquo;and the superiority of my insight (the <pb n="237"/> insight that you would attribute to me) would be measured by the amount of abuse I might pour on it&rsquo;; only, he continues, it is impossible to say anything new of a constitution of which the folly is admitted. (It is usual to assume that the text of this much-disputed passage is corrupt. See crit. note. Only Herbst among lecent clities defends it; and he understands <foreign lang="greek">οὐδενὸς ἂν χεῖρον</foreign> (<foreign lang="greek">γιγνώσκοιμι</foreign>) <foreign lang="greek">ὅσῳ καὶ</foreign> (<foreign lang="greek">οὐδενὸς ἂν χεῖρον</foreign>) <foreign lang="greek">λοιδορήσαιμι</foreign>: but the sense so obtained is by no means clear. The rendering of Wilkins, &lsquo;perhaps, indeed, it was better known to me than any one, as I have had more reason to complain of it than any one,&rsquo; does not correspond to the Greek, and is itself obscure.) Alcibiades says &lsquo;I might exhibit the extent of my insight by the amount of knowledge I might show of the nature of democracy, <hi rend="ITALIC">i.e.</hi> by abusing it&rsquo;; but, he says, the task is superfluous. Then, by a common rhetorical trick, he throws in a specimen of abuse (<foreign lang="greek">ὁμολογουμένη ἄνοια</foreign>). Thus <foreign lang="greek">λοιδορἡσαιμι</foreign> corresponds with <foreign lang="greek">ἐγιγνώσκομεν</foreign>: the knowledge would be extensive and peculiar, being gathered from experience of the tyranny of democracy, and it would be expressed in a <foreign lang="greek">λοιδορία</foreign>. The Scholium is <foreign lang="greek">αὐτὸς ἂν ἐγὼ οὐδενὸς χεῖρον λοιδορήσαιμι, ὅσῳ καὶ μέγιστα ὑπ’ αὐτῆς ἠδίκημαι</foreign>, which gives in a paraphrase the trne meaning, but is incomplete.

But serious objections to this are the intolerable harshness of the sentence, the absence of <foreign lang="greek">καὶ αὐτοί</foreign> after <foreign lang="greek">ἐξητάζοντο</foreign>, and above all the absurdity of supposing that the A. would hold a review at Leou while the Syr. were doing the same on the Anapus, instead of making the best of their way to Euryelus, their whole object being to seize the height unknown to the Syr., as the night voyage shows. And &sect; 2 below, <foreign lang="greek">ἐχώρει εὐθύς δρόμῳ</foreign>, is inconsistent with the supposition.

<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">κάτωθεν τοῦ κύκλου</lemma>&mdash;&lsquo;south of the fort.&rsquo; The reasons for the choice were&mdash;(1) the A. would be prevented from reaching the Great Harbour, (2) the north was unsuitable, because the A. fleet was at Thapsus, and a counterwork there would be exposed on two sides to an attack, (3) the A. were busy at the north, and their attention was withdrawn from the south. (Leake, Arnold, Grote, Holm, and Classen place the wall at the south.

(2) If the wall was <hi rend="ITALIC">north</hi> of the <foreign lang="greek">κύκλος</foreign>, why did the A. leave off building at the north wall after destroying the counterwork? They would have pressed on in that direction to prevent the Syr. from repeating their attempt to traverse the north wall. But if the Syr. built south, between the <foreign lang="greek">κύκλος</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">κρημνός</foreign>, Nicias had a good reason for building at once across this space, instead of continuing on the northern wall. (3) As <foreign lang="greek">κάτωθεν</foreign> can mean &lsquo;south of,&rsquo; it is unlikely that Thuc. would have used it to describe a wall north of the <foreign lang="greek">κύκλος</foreign>, as such a description would certainly mislead.)
