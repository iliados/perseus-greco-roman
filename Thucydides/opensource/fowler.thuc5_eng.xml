<p>The Athenians for religious reasons drive the Delians from their island.</p>
<p> <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">αἱ σπονδαὶ διελέλυντο</lemma>: the truce was at an end, but no warlike operations are recorded until Cleon led the expedition to Thrace, after the Pythian festival (Metageitnion, Ol. 89, 3, i.e. Aug., 422 B.C.). See App. &mdash;<lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ἐκεχειρίᾳ</lemma>: here and in <bibl n="Thuc. 5.2.2">c. 2. 2</bibl>; 49. 14, the <gloss>truce</gloss> in consequence of the festival. See App.</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ἱερῶσθαι</lemma>: pf. pass., depends upon <foreign lang="greek">ἡγησάμενοι</foreign>. It refers to the purification and consecration of Delos which had taken place four years before (cf. iii. 104). The Athenians now thought that the Delians had at that time been consecrated (again) to Apollo when they were not yet entirely purified and cleansed from an ancient pollution; that is, that the re-consecration had taken place too soon. But besides (<foreign lang="greek">καὶ ἅμα</foreign>), they thought that the manner of purification (by removal of the coffins) had not been sufficiently thorough.</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ᾗ πρότερόν μοι δεδήλωται</lemma>: upon this depends the indir. disc. <foreign lang="greek">ὡς . . . ἐνόμισαν ποιῆσαι</foreign>: &ldquo;In which I have before related that they believed,&rdquo; etc. See App.</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ποιῆσαι</lemma>: inf. aor. after <foreign lang="greek">ἐνόμισαν</foreign>, refers to past time like <foreign lang="greek">νομίσαντες . . . ποιήσασθαι</foreign> in <bibl n="Thuc. 7.17.9">vii. 17. 9</bibl>: <gloss>they believed that in removing the coffins they had acted rightly.</gloss> GMT. 23, 2; H. 854.&mdash;<lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">Ἀτραμύττειον</lemma> (not <foreign lang="greek">-τιον</foreign>; here and in <bibl n="Thuc. 8.108.19">viii. 108. 19</bibl> with Vat.): an important place on the coast of Mysia, near the foot of Mt. Ida.</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">Φαρνάκου</lemma>: Pharnaces was at that time still satrap on the Hellespont. He was succeeded in this office by his son Pharnabazus. Cf. <bibl n="Thuc. 8.6.3">viii. 6. 3</bibl>.&mdash;<lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ὥρμητο</lemma>: with ellipsis of <foreign lang="greek">οἰκῆσαι</foreign>. So we might say <gloss>as each man chose.</gloss> Cf. <bibl n="Thuc. 2.67.10">ii. 67. 10</bibl>; <bibl n="Thuc. 4.48.26">iv. 48. 26</bibl>; 74. 4; <bibl n="Thuc. 8.23.2">viii. 23. 2</bibl>.</p>
<p>The expulsion of the Delians is regarded by Boeckh (Abh. d. Berl. <pb n="12"/> Akad., 1834, p. 6 ff.) and Curtius (<title>Hist. of Greece</title>, III. p. 200) as an unjust and tyrannical measure. But perhaps the scrupulousness in matters of religion which is expressed in the beginning of the treaty of peace (<bibl n="Thuc. 4.118.1">iv. 118. 1</bibl>), and which caused the Delians to be brought back the very next year (<bibl n="Thuc. 5.32.4">c. 32. 4</bibl>), was really the motive of the action of the Athenians.

<p>Cleon goes with fresh troops to the coast of Thrace, where the siege of Scione still continues, and attacks Torone by land and sea.</p>

This is the <foreign lang="greek">περιτείχισμα ὃ προσπεριέβαλε τῇ πόλει. </foreign></p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">καὶ διελὼν</lemma> <foreign lang="greek"> κτἑ.</foreign>: the rel. pron., which would here be in a new case (dat.) must be supplied from the preceding <foreign lang="greek">ὅ</foreign>. G. 156, N. Usually a dem. or pers. pron. is introduced, as in <bibl n="Thuc. 1.74.8">i. 74. 8</bibl>; 122. 14; <bibl n="Thuc. 2.4.24">ii. 4. 24</bibl>.

But now that Brasidas is dead, the weaker members of the war party feel the full force of the desire for peace which they well know prevails at home. With this accurate presentation of the reasons which induced the Lacedaemonian generals to return home without having accomplished anything, Thuc. closes his account of the actual events of the ten years' war, and prepares thereby a transition to a retrospective glance in the next three chapters at the general course of the war. In these chapters he also shows, as he proceeds, the inclination of both sides toward peace, and then, in c. 17, tells of its conclusion.

<div type="chapter" n="19">
<p>The day of the ratification of the treaty and the names of those on both sides who took the oath.</p>
<p>This chapter is part of the official document recording the peace. It determines the day with which the peace shall begin for all parties, and gives the names of the men who are to take the oath. In c. 20 the narrative is resumed with the mention of the date of the ratification of the treaty. The indics. <foreign lang="greek">ἄρχει, ὤμνυον καὶ ἐσπένδοντο</foreign>, are not unusual in treaties. See Steup, <title>Stud.</title> I. p. 68.</p>
<p> <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ἄρχει</lemma>: the manner of dating differs from that of <bibl n="Thuc. 4.118.49">iv. 118. 49</bibl>, inasmuch as here, not the day, but the year appears as subj.; for <foreign lang="greek">ἔφορος Πλειστόλας</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">ἄρχων Ἀλκαῖος</foreign> are the usual expressions for the year, Ol. 89, 3. The dats. (<foreign lang="greek">τετάρτῃ</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">ἕκτῃ</foreign>) denoting the day immediately follow the nouns denoting the year. Lit., <hi rend="italic">the year of the Ephor Pleistolas, etc., begins the peace on the fourth day from the end of Artemisios; i.e.</hi> the peace begins on the fourth, etc. The 27th of Artemisios in Sparta or the 25th of Elaphebolion in Athens for the year 421 B.C. fell about the middle of April. See Curtius, <title>Hist. of Greece</title>, III. p. 207.</p>
<p> <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">Πλειστοάναξ, Ἆγις</lemma>: see App.&mdash; 8. <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">Ἀθηναίων δέ</lemma>: of the seventeen Athenians, eleven (since for <foreign lang="greek">Ἀριστοκρίτης</foreign> of the Mss. we must certainly write <foreign lang="greek">Ἀριστοκράτης</foreign> from c. 24; cf. <bibl n="Thuc. 8.89.12">viii. 89. 12</bibl>) are known to us as generals in the course of the war. Among these Nicias, Laches, Hagnon, Lamachus, and Demosthenes are the most noted. Lampon was celebrated (Plut. <title>Per.</title> c. 6) and derided (Ar. <title>Av.</title> 521, 988) as an oraclemonger. Only Isthmionicus, Procles (for the general Procles of Ol. 88. 2 fell in the campaign against the Aetolians; see <bibl n="Thuc. 3.98.23">iii. 98. 23</bibl>), Myrtilus, Iolcius, and Timocrates are not elsewhere mentioned. The reason for the number seventeen cannot be determined with any degree of certainty. Ullrich suggests on the Athenian side perhaps two priests, half of the generals of that year, and one citizen of each phyle. Perhaps the oath was taken on the Lacedaemonian side by a number of Lacedaemonians and one each from the allied cities which took part in the peace. Certainly the words <foreign lang="greek">καὶ</foreign> <pb n="46"/> <foreign lang="greek">ὤμοσαν κατὰ πόλεις</foreign> in <bibl n="Thuc. 5.18.2">c. 18. 2</bibl> seem to imply that the allies took part in the oath as prescribed in <bibl n="Thuc. 5.18.47">c. 18. 47</bibl> ff., though Ullrich, p. 19, believes that they did not. Perhaps the number of Athenian envoys at Sparta had gradually risen to seventeen, all of whom were then commissioned to take the oath, or perhaps Kirchhoff is right in deducing the number from the peculiar Spartan constitution, in which case the seventeen Athenians would be appointed to correspond to the seventeen Spartans. See App. on <bibl n="Thuc. 5.18.50">c. 18. 50</bibl>.

If <foreign lang="greek">ὡς</foreign> were inserted before <foreign lang="greek">ὁρῶσι</foreign> (Kr. and Meineke), it would interfere with the peculiarly Thucydidean structure of the sent.: &ldquo;on the one hand, the Argives drew themselves up for battle; on the other, the Lacedaemonians, as they are returning to their former position, <pb n="119"/> see the enemy already drawn up in battle array and brought down from the hill.&rdquo; The order of these last words is the reverse of the order of the events.

Since the Lacedaemonians had now attained their object of drawing the enemy down into the plain as expressed in <bibl n="Thuc. 5.65.14">c. 65. 14</bibl> ff., it seems strange that they should be surprised at finding them there, except in so far as they may have expected them to wait a little longer.

<p> <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">λόχοι μὲν γὰρ</lemma> <foreign lang="greek"> κτἑ.</foreign>: the computation of Thuc., which is undoubtedly correct as applied to the army engaged in the battle of Mantinea, though Xen. <title>Rep. Lac.</title> 11. 4 makes a different statement, is correctly summed up by the Schol.: <foreign lang="greek">ἔχει ἕκαστος λόχος πεντηκοστύας τέσσαρας, καὶ γίνονται τῶν ἑπτὰ λόχων εἴκοσι ὀκτώ, ἔχει ἑκάστη πεντηκοστὺς ἐνωμοτίας τέσσαρας, καὶ γίνονται τῶν εἴκοσι ὀκτὼ πεντηκοστύων ἐνωμοτίαι ἑκατὸν δώδεκα. ἔχει ἑκάστη ἐνωμοτία ἄνδρας τριάκοντα δύο</foreign> (i.e. 4 x 8, because four men stood in the first rank of each enomoty, and they were drawn up as a rule, <foreign lang="greek">ἐπὶ πᾶν</foreign>, eight deep), <foreign lang="greek">ὥστε γίνεσθαι τὸν πάντα στρατὸν τρισχιλίους πεντακοσίους ὀγδοήκοντα τέσσαρας</foreign> (7 x 4 x 4 x 4 x 8 = 3584). Thuc. himself gives only the sum of the front rank of the army when drawn up: 7 (<foreign lang="greek">λόχοι</foreign>) x 4 (<foreign lang="greek">πεντηκοστύες</foreign>) x 4 (<foreign lang="greek">ἐνωμοτίαι</foreign>) x 4 (<foreign lang="greek">ἄνδρες ἐν τῷ πρώτῳ ζυγῷ</foreign>) = 448. This multiplied by 8 for the depth of the array gives likewise 3584, and with the 600 Sciritae, makes the whole army of the Lacedaemonians 4184. See R&uuml;stow and Koechly, <title>Gesch. d. gr.

<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ἐπὶ δὲ βάθος...κατέστησαν ἐπὶ ὀκτώ</lemma> : because it seemed strange that the depth of the lochi should be left to the discretion of the lochagi, Dobree struck out the words <foreign lang="greek">ἀλλ’  ὡς λοχαγὸς ἕκαστος ἐβούλετο</foreign>, and went so far as to propose the omission of the whole passage, <foreign lang="greek">τῆς τε ἐνωμοτίας . . . ἐβούλετο</foreign>. Others also, and esp. Grote, find the passage troublesome. If we take the enomoty at 32 men (with the Schol.) and assume (with Thuc.) that four men stood in the front rank, then the arrangement of the remaining 28 men may have varied somewhat, so as to cause a variation in the depth of the column.

<p> <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">οὐκ ἦλθον ἐκ πλείονος</lemma>: the sense of this passage evidently is: &ldquo;while their friends were sending for them, they failed to come for a very long (or too long) time; but at last they postponed the festival and started on the march&rdquo; (<foreign lang="greek">ἐβοήθουν</foreign> impf.).
