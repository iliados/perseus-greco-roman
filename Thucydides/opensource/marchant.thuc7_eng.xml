              and the Romans call it, was chief city of the Elymians, who were thought to be
              Trojans. It was perpetually at war with Selinus. Life was difficult in the W. corner
              of Sicily owing to the constant rivalry of the Carthaginians and the Greeks there. In
              409 Segesta joined Carthage in an attack on Selinus which destroyed for ever the

              circumvallation and the besieging fleet had command of the Great Harbour, when Syr.
              was in terror and peace was being discussed there. See also on c. <bibl n="thuc. 7.1.4">1.4</bibl>. The Sicels hoped to use Athens as a means for

              Before condemning the words right out we must notice the train of thought that has led

              τούτῳ</lemma>&mdash;there have been from early times two ways of understanding
              this passage: (1) the scholiast thinks that Thuc. is comparing the disaster at the

              him to be comparing this disaster with other battles of the Sicilian war. The
              scholiast is probably right, since there is no other instance of great carnage,
                <foreign lang="greek">φόνος</foreign> or <foreign lang="greek">σφαγή</foreign>, in
              the Sicihan war with which the last disaster could be aptly compared; and as Thuc. was
              writing the history of the Sicilian expedition, not as a separate work, but as part of
              his general history, it is strange that he should speak of the Sicilian campaigns only
              in giving an idea of the extent of the loss. (Arnold says &lsquo;it is as if an
              historian of the French campaign in Russia were to say of their loss at the Beresina,
              &ldquo;that it was greater than on any other occasion throughout this Russian
              campaign.&rdquo;&rsquo; But, after the losses of 1812, that statement would
              convey an idea of awful slaughter, whereas this does not.)</p>
