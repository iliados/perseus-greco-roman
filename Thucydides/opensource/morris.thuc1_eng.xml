          <p>THOUGH we have several ancient biographies of Thucydides,<note anchored="yes" n="1">One
              compiled of three distinct portions, passing under the name of
              Marcellinus&mdash;on which see Grauert, Rheinisches Museum, 1827, p. 172 ff., and
              Fr. Ritter, Rh. Mus. 1845, p. 321, and id. on Didymi <title>Opuscula</title>,
              Coloniae, 1845; another by an anonymous grammarian; and a short notice in Suidas s.v.
                <foreign lang="greek">Θουκυδίδης</foreign>.</note> our trustworthy knowledge of
            the circumstances of his life rests almost exclusively on a few notices casually
            imparted by himself. Everything else that we are told of him either by his biographers
            or in the occasional remarks of other writers has the character of uncertain conjecture
            based upon fragmentary tradition.<note anchored="yes" n="2">The epitaph presently to be
              mentioned is to be excepted, as is rightly remarked by E. Petersen in his careful
                <title>Disputatio de vita Thucydidis</title>, Dorpat, 1873, p. 15.</note> The more
            we examine these scanty testimonies, the stronger becomes the impression that Thucydides
            seldom appeared in person in public life, and that except in a few instances he withdrew
            from the gaze of the world. We may infer, therefore, that the rhetorical exaggerations
            of the later biographies have very slight value for us; and only a few definite
            statements, which present themselves here and there, appear to be derived from
            trustworthy sources. In the following survey of his life, therefore, we must take as the
            basis of the narrative only the circumstances reported by himself, and endeavour to
            combine them into a whole with a cautious use of material coming from other quarters.</p>
          <p>Thucydides belonged by birth to a family which by its wealth<note anchored="yes" n="3">See his own testimony on this point in iv. 105. &sect; 1, <foreign lang="greek">τὸν Θουκυδίδην κτῆσίν τε ἔχειν τῶν χρυσείων μετάλλων ἐργασίας ἐν τῇ
                περὶ ταῦτα Θρᾴκῃ καὶ ἀπ’ αὐτοῦ δύνασθαι ἐν τοῖς πρώτοις τῶν
                ἠπειρωτῶν</foreign>.</note> secured him complete independence, and by its foreign
            possessions early directed his gaze beyond the borders of Attica to the relations of
            distant nations. The Attic deme Halimus, on the coast between Phalerum and Colias, in
            the tribe of Leontis, is mentioned as the place of his birth. He tells us himself (<bibl n="Thuc. 4.104.15">iv.104.15</bibl>) that <pb n="2"/> his father's name was
              Olorus;<note anchored="yes" n="4">Marcell., &sect; 16, with a certain assumption
              of accuracy, asserts that the name was Orolus; but this is not to be regarded against
              the above authority.</note> and his grave was undoubtedly in the family vault of
            Cimon, near that of Elpinice, Cimon's sister,<note anchored="yes" n="5">On the position
              of the sepulchre of this family, see E. Curtius, <title>Attische Studien</title>, p.
              12.</note> as Plutarch evidently saw it himself (<title>Cim.</title> c. 4); and we may
            accordingly assume it as certain that Olorus, the father of Thucydides was a near
            kinsman of the Thracian prince of that name, whose daughter Hegesipyle was wife of the
            great Miltiades (Hdt. vi. 39) and mother of Cimon; but the degree of relationship cannot
            be more nearly defined. It is only Marcellinus (&sect; 2) who gives to his mother
            the name of the mother of Cimon, Hegesipyle; while Plutarch makes no such statement
            where he could hardly have failed to do so, had he been aware of the fact; and we must,
            therefore, be content with the knowledge that Cimon's grandfather Olorus was an ancestor
              (<foreign lang="greek">πρόγονος</foreign> in Plutarch)&mdash;from the similarity
            of the name we may perhaps infer the grandfather&mdash;of the younger Olorus, the
            father of the historian.<note anchored="yes" n="6">The genealogical table given by O.
              M&uuml;ller, <title>Hist. of the Literature of Greece</title>, II. p. 117, and by
              Roscher, <title lang="de">Leben, Werk, und Zeitalter des Thukydides</title>, p. 90,
              which derives the historian on the mother's side as well as on the father's from the
              Thracian prince Olorus, is of very questionable probability. It is more likely that
              another daughter of King Olorus, a sister of Hegesipyle the wife of Miltiades, married
              an Athenian citizen, and that Olorus the father of Thucydides was born of this
              marriage. Little weight is to be attached to the statement of Marcell., &sect; 18,
              following Hermippus, and of the Schol. on i. 20. &sect; 2, that Thuc. was of kin
              to the Pisistratidae; but this is not impossible, since such a connexion might exist
              through his grandfather on the mother's or father's side. This is the view of Grote,
                <title>Hist. of Greece</title>, IV. chap. 30, p. 36, note (1869). No certain results
              have been reached in the more recent discussions of the question:
              M&uuml;llerStr&uuml;bing, <title>Aristophanes</title>, p. 537 ff.; von
              Wilamowitz-M&ouml;llendorf, Hermes, 12, p. 339 ff.; R&uuml;hl,
              Jahrb&uuml;cher, 1878, p. 313 f.</note> That this Olorus was in full possession of
            Athenian citizenship appears probable from the way in which his son designates himself
              (<bibl n="Thuc. 4.104.15">iv.104.15</bibl>), <foreign lang="greek">Θουκυδίδην τὸν
              Ὀλόρου</foreign>, for here, where he introduces himself as a <foreign lang="greek">στρατηγός</foreign>, it is only as an Athenian citizen that his father could be
            mentioned in the official style.<note anchored="yes" n="7">M&uuml;ller-Str&uuml;bing, p. 307, regards the addition of the father's name
              in such cases merely as a courteous recognition of social distinction.</note> Cimon no
            doubt owed his wealth to the possessions of his mother's family on the Thracian coast,
            which may have been <pb n="3"/> enlarged by the reduction of the neighbouring Thasos
            (B.C. 463; i. 101. &sect; 3); and so Thucydides by the same relationship came into
            the possession of his Thracian property, which consisted in goldmines near Scapte
              Hyle.<note anchored="yes" n="8">See B&ouml;ckh, <title>Public Economy of the
                Athenians</title>, p. 418.</note> The assertion of Marcellinus (&sect; 19), that
            he married a rich woman of that region and so became possessed of the gold-mines, can
            hardly be anything else than an idle guess.</p>
          <p>On the whole it seems likely that Thucydides was of near kin to Cimon, and younger by
            one generation. We may conjecture that as boy and youth he looked up with reverence to
            his noble kinsman, while he was in the full strength of his manhood and at the height of
            his renown. If no other information were at hand, we might assume that when Cimon died
            (B.C. 449) about sixty years of age&mdash;greater exactness is not
            attainable&mdash;Thucydides was a young man between twenty and thirty. But as to the
            time of his birth two statements are made. The one is in Marcellinus (&sect; 34), of
            extreme vagueness: (<foreign lang="greek">λέγεταιπαύσασθαι τὸν βίον ὑπὲρ
              τὰ πεντήκοντα ἔτη μὴ πληρώσαντα τῆς συγγραφῆς τὴν προθεσμίαν</foreign>. The
            other is due to Pamphila, who in the time of Nero made a great compilation of the
            results of learning. A Gellius (<title>N. A.</title> xv. 23) writes as follows: <quote lang="la">Hellanicus, Herodotus, Thucydides historiae scriptores in isdem fere
              temporibus laude ingenti floruerunt, et non nimis longe distantibus fuerunt aetatibus.
              nam Hellanicus initio belli Peloponnesiaci fuisse quinque et sexaginta annos natus
              videtur, Herodotus tres et quinquaginta, Thucydides quadraginta. scriptum est hoc in
              libro undecimo Pamphilae.</quote> Marcellinus's remark is plainly of no use for any
            certain inference. <title>How much beyond</title> fifty years is one to go back to reach
            the birth-year of Thucydides? It is hardly more than the result of an approximate
            calculation, that Thucydides, who represents himself (i. 1. &sect; 1; <bibl n="Thuc. 5.26.24">v.26.24</bibl>) as of competent judgment at the beginning of the
            Peloponnesian war, and who must have died in any case after the end of it in B.C. 404,
            must have been born before B.C. 454. One who wrote <foreign lang="greek">ὑπὲρ τὰ
              πεντήκοντα ἔτη</foreign> clearly had himself no accurate knowledge. As to the
            testimony of Pamphila, Diels indicates the proper way of looking at it in his <title lang="de">Untersuchungen &uuml;ber Apollodors Chronika</title> (Rhein. Mus. 31, p.
            1-54). The dates given are no doubt taken from <pb n="4"/> Apollodorus, whose
            chronological handbook had reached among the Greeks and Romans an almost canonical
            acceptance. He adopted the method usual among Alexandrian scholars of determining the
              <foreign lang="greek">ἀκμή</foreign> or <hi rend="italic">floruit</hi> of historical
            personages by reference to any circumstance the date of which was known; and as this
              <foreign lang="greek">ἀκμή</foreign> was regularly assumed to be the 40th year,
            probably on the basis of Pythagorean doctrines, it was easy from it to deduce the year
            of birth. The <foreign lang="greek">ἀκμή</foreign> of Herodotus was placed by
            Apollodorus probably at the time of his settlement at Thurii (B.C. 444), and accordingly
            his birth would be in 484, and his age is given as 53 at the beginning of the
            Peloponnesian war.<note anchored="yes" n="9">Before we can judge about the case of
              Hellanicus, we must know with greater certainty what his relation to Herodotus was,
              and at what time he wrote. Diels and Wilamowitz differ widely.</note> The <foreign lang="greek">ἀκμή</foreign> of Thucydides may have been fixed by Apollodorus on the
            ground of his own assertion (i. 1. &sect; 1; <bibl n="Thuc. 5.26.23">v.26.23</bibl>)
            as to the maturity of his judgment at the beginning of the war.<note anchored="yes" n="10">With this agrees the notice in Suidas: <foreign lang="greek">ἤκμαζε κατὰ
                τὴν ὀγδοηκοστὴν καὶ ἑβδόμην Ὀλυμπιάδα</foreign> (B.C. 432). See Petersen,
              p. 12.</note> Diels therefore is right in saying that these considerations forbid us
            to regard the dates assigned to Herodotus and Thucydides as based on anything stronger
            than more or less probable hypothesis. If we cannot, however, find in the testimony of
            Pamphila any positive basis for inferring the exact year of the birth of Thucydides, it
            is nevertheless not without importance that in the exposition of his own words we reach
            the same conclusion as Apollodorus. Thucydides says of himself (<bibl n="Thuc. 5.26.23">v.26.23</bibl>) that he lived through the whole war <foreign lang="greek">αἰσθανόμενος τῇ ἡλικίᾳ καὶ προσέχων τὴν γνώμην ὅπως ἀκριβές τι
              εἴσεται</foreign>, and it is clear that he did not make this remark at the close of
            the twenty-seven years' war in order to set his readers at rest as to his mental power
            and his capacity for observation <hi rend="italic">at that time</hi>&mdash;the whole
            work, with the completion of which he was then engaged, was ample evidence of
            that,&mdash;but to insist upon the circumstance which was much more likely to be
            called in question, that nearly 30 years before he was possessed of all the qualities
            requisite for the undertaking of so great a work with a full consciousness of its
            importance; and so was justified in asserting that he had lived through the whole of <pb n="5"/> it with his power of observation and inquiry at their best. And it is just
            this clearness of vision and maturity of judgment that Thucydides asserts of himself in
            the opening words of his history: <foreign lang="greek">ἀρξάμενοσξυγγράφεινεὐθὺς καθισταμένου καὶ ἐλπίσας μέγαν
              τε ἔσεσθαι καὶ ἀξιολογώτατον τῶν προγεγενημένων, τεκμαιρόμενος κτἑ.</foreign>
            It is plain that an author could not so write of himself unless he felt that at the time
            of which he speaks he was able to exercise on important questions an independent
            judgment founded on experience of life and a wide-reaching survey of the relations of
            things. Of course it cannot be asserted that for this an age of 40 years is
            indispensable; but still less can it be denied that such a maturity is in excellent
            harmony with expressions of this character.<note anchored="yes" n="11">Stahl (<title>De
                Thucydidis vita et scriptis</title> in the preface to the Tauchn. Edition, p. v)
              thinks it probable, in view of the writer's own assertions and the circumstances of
              his life, that he was born about Ol. 79. 1, B.C. 464, and was from thirty to
              thirty-five years old at the beginning of the war. This is quite possible, but is no
              more susceptible of proof than any other assumption. Kr&uuml;ger's view, that
              Thuc. was born in Ol. 80 or 81, is fully developed in his
              <title>Untersuchungen</title>, p. 9-32, and maintained against objections in his
                <title>Epikritischer Nachtrag</title>, p. 8-15. Ullrich, in his <hi rend="italic">Beitr&auml;ge zur Erkl&auml;rung des Thukydides</hi>, p. 128, 129, note
              151, maintains that Thuc. at the beginning of the war was between 23 and 28 years old.
              M&uuml;ller-Str&uuml;bing, <title>Aristoph.</title> p. 537, thinks he was born
              about 460; and Wilamowitz, Herm. 12, p. 327, calls the estimate of Apollodorus
              arbitrary and foolish; but neither gives satisfactory reasons for his opinion.</note>
          </p>
          <p>If we adhere to the testimony of Pamphila, which goes back to Apollodorus, that
            Thucydides was born about B.C. 470, the first forty years of his life, about which we
            possess no further knowledge, divide themselves into two portions; the period namely in
            which, mainly under the guidance of Cimon, Athens created her Hegemony externally,
            during the self-effacement of Sparta; and that in which, under the imperial
            administration of Pericles, she enjoyed the freest internal development and at the same
            time took up and cultivated all the elements of the noblest intellectual life.<note anchored="yes" n="12">These are the two periods, each approximately of 20 years'
              duration, which are distinguished in the funeral oration of Pericles, <bibl n="Thuc. 2.36.6">ii.36.6</bibl>: <foreign lang="greek">οἱ πατέρες ἡμῶν
                κτησάμενοι πρὸς οἷς ἐδέξαντο ὅσην ἔχομεν ἀρχὴν οὐκ ἀπόνως ἡμῖν
                τοῖς νῦν προσκατέλιπον</foreign>, and <foreign lang="greek">τὰ δὲ πλείω
                αὐτῆς αὐτοὶ ἡμεῖς οἵδε οἱ νῦν ἔτι ὄντες μάλιστα ἐν τῇ
                καθεστηκυίᾳ ἡλικίᾳ ἐπηυξήσαμεν</foreign>. Thucydides was at that time in this
                <foreign lang="greek">καθεστηκυῖα ἡλικία</foreign>.</note> How closely Thucydides
            stood related to public life, <pb n="6"/> particularly in the second period, during
            which his self-consciousness must have been fully awake, is a matter on which we have
            not the slightest information. But in his history we find evidence, that, though his
            family traditions must have inclined him to a moderate aristocracy, his full love and
            admiration were given to the intellectual greatness of Pericles. If, as is probable, he
            did not discharge any public duties under Pericles, he must have followed with his
            liveliest sympathy the public administration of that great man and have rejoiced in the
            results accomplished by his creative spirit; certainly he heard from his own lips those
            speeches of which he has given us imperishable records, and in them trustworthy outlines
            for forming a true picture of the mind of Pericles. It is, however, a probable
            conjecture that Thucydides, not only at a later time during his banishment, but also in
            his earlier life, often passed his time on his Thracian estates, which no doubt
            frequently required the presence and oversight of the owner for the <foreign lang="greek">ἐργασία τῶν χρυσείων μετάλλων</foreign>. Only in this way could he
            gain the high regard among the Thracian dynasts from which Brasidas feared results
            injurious to his purposes (<bibl n="Thuc. 4.105.2">iv.105.2</bibl>). It seems also very
            natural that the position of independence, which under these circumstances Thucydides
            enjoyed also in Athens, may have exerted an important influence on the calmness of
            spirit and the impartiality of judgment with which he surveyed and described for
            posterity the relations of the Greek States and the events of his time.</p>
          <p>If we try to form a picture of the early training of Thucydides as we may conceive it
            between Ol. 80 and 82, B.C. 460-450, when we examine the scanty notices which seem at
            first to promise a fuller knowledge, we find ourselves limited to what we can gather
            from our acquaintance with the intellectual life in Athens at that epoch. The often
            repeated story that Thucydides as a boy was present at a recitation by Herodotus at
            Olympia or elsewhere, and was moved thereby to tears, plainly is of later origin than
            the time of Lucian, who in his account of the powerful effect produced by Herodotus at
              Olympia<note anchored="yes" n="13">
              <title>Herod.</title> 1.</note> would certainly not have failed to mention this story
            if he had known it; later too than the better <pb n="7"/> portion of the biography of
            Marcellinus, which also does not notice it. The story is found in Suidas, s.v. <foreign lang="greek">ὀργᾶν</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">Θουκυδίδης</foreign>, in
            Photius, <title>Bibl.</title> n. 60, and in the last part of the biography of
            Marcellinus, &sect; 54; though only Suidas mentions Olympia as the scene of it. All
            are derived from one and the same confused statement, the chief purpose of which was to
            retain in remembrance the unusual expression in the assumed exclamation of Herodotus,
              <foreign lang="greek">ὦ Ὄλορε, ὀργᾷ ἡ φύσις τοῦ υἱοῦ σου</foreign> (or
              <foreign lang="greek">ὀργῶσαν ἔχει τὴν ψυχήν, τὴν φύσινπρὸς
              μαθήματα</foreign>. Even if we pay no regard to the chronological difficulties, which
            cannot be surmounted unless we give up the testimony of Pamphila, it cannot be said that
            Kr&uuml;ger (<title>Untersuchungen</title>, p. 30 ff.) has succeeded in giving
            credibility to a story so late and so ill-attested. The recitation of Herodotus at

            no doubt right in regarding as a fiction. If Herodotus recited portions of his work at
            Athens, the most probable date is that furnished by Eusebius,<note anchored="yes" n="15">

            his listeners&mdash;yet not as a boy of 10 years but as a young man of between 20
            and 30 years&mdash;is very credible. He may have then received an abiding impression
            that an engaging narrative of entertaining events may be well enough adapted for a
            single recitation before an assembled crowd, but not so a strict historical
            representation, which is based on painstaking inquiry; and this may explain his somewhat
            bitter assertion, <bibl n="Thuc. 1.21.4">i.21.4</bibl>, <foreign lang="greek">ὡς

          <p>Whether the statement of Marcellinus, &sect; 22, that Thucydides studied philosophy
            with Anaxagoras and rhetoric with Antiphon, rests upon authentic grounds, is of little
            importance for us; these two men are so decidedly representatives of the new spirit,
            which in both these departments made its way into Athens in their time <pb n="8"/> and
            exercised a powerful influence on all who had any share of culture, that we should be
            forced to assume for Thucydides a relation of this sort, even if there were no testimony
            for it. Both lived at a time quite compatible with this assumption. Anaxagoras, who was
            probably born in Ol. 70, about 500 B.C.,<note anchored="yes" n="16">See Brandis, <hi rend="italic">Geschichte der Griechisch-R&ouml;mischen Philosophie</hi>, I. p.
              233.</note> sojourned permanently in Athens between 470 and 450 B.C., and lived on
            terms of intimacy with Pericles: Antiphon, born about 485 B.C., and therefore some 10
            years older than Thucydides, must have stood before his eyes as the pattern of manly and
            energetic expression<note anchored="yes" n="17">See Curtius, <title>Hist. of
              Greece</title>, II. p. 569.</note> and may have been in nearer personal relations with
            him; and accordingly the historian in the terms in which he describes the character of
            Antiphon (<bibl n="Thuc. 8.68.5">viii.68.5</bibl>) has left a testimony to his merits in
            which personal affection is unmistakable. An influence on the training of Thucydides of
            a similar character may be presumed to have been exercised also by the Sophists
            Protagoras, Prodicus, and Gorgias, who from the middle of the fifth century exerted
            themselves for a longer or shorter time in Athens to spread abroad, by formal
            instruction and by lectures, that adroitness of thought and speech which they had
            acquired by manifold study and practice. We are told by Marcellinus,<note anchored="yes" n="18">&sect; 36, <foreign lang="greek">ἐζήλωσε ἐπ’ ὀλίγον καὶ τὰς
                Γοργίου τοῦ Λεοντίνου παρισώσεις καὶ τὰς ἀντιθέσεις τῶν ὀνομάτων . . .
                καὶ μέντοι καὶ Προδίκου τοῦ Κείου τὴν ἐπὶ τοῖς ὀνόμασιν
              ἀκριβολογίαν</foreign>.</note> and it is in itself sufficiently credible, that
            Thucydides appropriated and employed for his own style many of the results of the close
            attention which these men paid to the forms of speech and their relation to thought.
              Philostratus<note anchored="yes" n="19">
              <title>Epist.</title> 13, p. 919.</note> too says expressly that he borrowed <foreign lang="greek">τὸ μεγαλόγνωμον καὶ τὴν ὀφρῦν</foreign> from Gorgias, who no doubt
            visited Athens before the famous embassy of 427 B.C.;<note anchored="yes" n="20">See
              Foss, <title>De Gorgia Leontino</title>, p. 23 ff.; Marcell. &sect; 36, 51,

              <foreign lang="greek">Συναγωγὴ τεχνῶν</foreign>, p. 53 ff.</note> proves by many
            particular instances the influence exerted on the language of Thucydides by the theories
            of Prodicus on synonymy. We must remember, besides, that the Athens in which Thucydides
            passed his boyhood and youth was full of the noblest efforts and most glorious products
            of poetry, sculpture, and architecture; that <pb n="9"/> he must have seen the aged
            Aeschylus before his departure to Sicily, have been acquainted with Sophocles and
            Euripides in the highest maturity of their artistic activity, and have seen Phidias and
            his disciples creating their immortal works before his eyes. When we recollect these
            things and consider besides what has been said about his relation to the great statesmen
            of that time, we may form a tolerably complete conception of the influences which worked
            upon his mental development. There can be no doubt that he expresses his own love and
            admiration for these intellectual blessings in the delineation of Attic culture and
            Attic genius which is found in the funeral oration of Pericles, especially in ii. 38 and
            40. In the joyous recognition of the <foreign lang="greek">πλεῖσται ἀναπαῦλαι τῶν
              πόνων</foreign> to be found in the <foreign lang="greek">ἀγῶσι καὶ θυσίαις
              διετησίοις</foreign> we may perceive his delight in the splendour and brilliancy of
            the Attic stage and the panathenaic processions; and in the charge (<bibl n="Thuc. 2.43.7">ii.43.7</bibl>) <foreign lang="greek">τὴν τῆς πόλεως δύναμιν καθ’
              ἡμέραν ἔργῳ θεᾶσθαι καὶ ἐραστὰς γίγνεσθαι αὐτῆς</foreign> we can recognize
            his pride not merely in the well-equipped warlike power of Athens but also in the
            glorious buildings of the Acropolis, which daily looked down on the citizens. We may
            conceive, then, that all the means of cultivation which the Athens of Pericles offered,
            as no other spot in the world has ever offered them within the same limits, and
            intercourse with men of eminence in all directions, combined to excite and forward the
            intellectual development of Thucydides up to the maturity of his manhood.</p>
          <p>But the question still remains whether and to what extent he took an active part in the
            public life of his native city in peace or war. As an answer to it we cannot be
            satisfied with the statement of Marcellinus, &sect; 23, <foreign lang="greek">οὐκ
              ἐπολιτεύσατο ὁ συγγραφεὺς οὐδὲ προσῆλθε τῷ βήματι</foreign>, or with the
            assertion of Dionysius, <title>Ep. ad Cn. Pomp.</title>, 3. 9, p. 770, <foreign lang="greek">ἐν πρώτοις ἦγοναὐτὸνἈθηναῖοι στρατηγιῶν τε
              καὶ τῶν ἄλλων τιμῶν ἀξιοῦντες</foreign>. All precise knowledge of his early
            life is wanting; but while on the one hand we cannot doubt that, if Thucydides had taken
            any prominent part in public affairs, we should have learned the fact either from
            himself or from some other source, and while it is not at all improbable that his
            Thracian interests often kept him at a distance from Athens; still on the other hand it
            is certain that he must have recommended himself <pb n="10"/> to his fellow-citizens by
            some manifestation of capacity before B.C. 424, since he was then elected one of the 10
            Strategi. The inference of K. F. Hermann (G&ouml;ttingen Gelehrte Anzeigen, 1847, p.
            1383) from the minuteness of the narrative of the expedition of Myronides against Megara
            (i. 105. &sect; 5, 6), that Thucydides may have been personally concerned in it, is
            to be rejected on chronological grounds. For he could not then (B.C. 460) have been more
            than 11 years old, even assuming the earliest date, B.C. 471, which is assigned as the
            year of his birth.</p>
          <p>We shall not be very far from the truth if we conceive the life of Thucydides, till the
            occurrence of those events which directed the whole power of his mind to a new task, to
            have been passed more in the pursuit of private interests than of the career of a
            statesman, whatever may have been the sympathy with which he observed public events. But
            the relations in which he was placed must have been eminently calculated to keep his
            attention alert in all directions and to make him susceptible to the influences of a
            rich and energetic life. In this way he gained that maturity of mind with which, as he
            tells us himself, he recognized from the very beginning the importance of the momentous
            war and devoted himself with unintermitting interest and attention to the observation of
            its course.<note anchored="yes" n="22">
              <bibl n="Thuc. 1.1.3">i.1.3</bibl>, <foreign lang="greek">ἐλπίσας μέγαν τε
                ἔσεσθαι καὶ ἀξιολογώτατον κτἑ.</foreign> He asserts the same clear prevision
              of Pericles, <bibl n="Thuc. 2.65.22">ii.65.22</bibl>, <foreign lang="greek">ἡ

              course of the war he made careful observation a matter of duty.</note>
          </p>
          <p>Twice in the course of the war events occurred which give him occasion to mention
            himself. In <bibl n="Thuc. 2.48.15">ii.48.15</bibl> he introduces his precise and vivid
            description of the plague at Athens with the words <foreign lang="greek">ταῦτα δηλώσω
              αὐτός τε νοσήσας καὶ αὐτὸς ἰδὼν ἄλλους πάσχοντας</foreign>. He must
            therefore have been at Athens during that fearful visitation, B.C. 430-29, and his
            account is derived from his own experience and observation.</p>
          <p>In the eighth year of the war, B.C. 424, when he was 48 years old, he was, as he tells
            us <bibl n="Thuc. 4.104.15">iv.104.15</bibl>, charged as <foreign lang="greek">στρατηγός</foreign> with the care of the Thracian coast (<foreign lang="greek">ὁ
              ἕτερος στρατηγὸς τῶν ἐπὶ Θρᾴκης</foreign>), when <pb n="11"/> Brasidas was
            threatening Amphipolis, the most important possession of Athens in those parts. In the
            late autumn of B.C. 424 he lay with seven triremes in the harbour of Thasos, and at the
            first summons of his colleague Eucles, who was in command at Amphipolis, hastened to his
            aid. But the town had surrendered before Thucydides could reach it. The town of
            E&iuml;on, however, at the mouth of the Strymon, which he reached the same evening,
            he occupied in good time, and made his preparations so skillfully that the assault made
            by Brasidas by land as well as by water was successfully resisted (iv. 107. &sect;
            2).</p>
          <p>The results for himself personally which followed this misfortune Thucydides reports
            with the same reserve with which he excludes from his narrative everything which does
            not belong to the course of the war; mentioning them not at this place but only casually
            in v. 26. &sect; 5, in order to found thereon a remark important for the character
            of his history. As in that passage by the words <foreign lang="greek">ἐπεβίων . . .
              εἴσομαι</foreign> he asserts from one point of view his competence as the historian
            of the Peloponnesian war, so, in order to show the advantage he possessed in wide local
            knowledge and personal observation of the matters in hand, he adds the statement:
              <foreign lang="greek">καὶ ξυνέβη μοι φεύγειν τὴν ἐμαυτοῦ ἔτη εἴκοσι μετὰ
              τὴν ἐς Ἀμφίπολιν στρατηγίαν, καὶ γενομένῳ παρ’ ἀμφοτέροις τοῖς πράγμασι,
              καὶ οὐχ ἧσσον τοῖς Πελοποννησίων διὰ τὴν φυγὴν, καθ̓ ἡσυχίαν τι μᾶλλον
              αἴσθεσθαι</foreign>. It is certain from this passage that Thucydides, in consequence
            of his failure to save Amphipolis, had to leave his country for 20 years, and that he
            employed a portion of this time in visiting the scenes of the war on both sides,
            particularly in the territory of the Peloponnesians. Everything else, however, which
            passes beyond this distinct testimony of Thucydides, rests on conjecture; it is
            probable, though it cannot be proved, that Cleon, who was then at the height of his
            influence, caused the adoption of the decree for the banishment of Thucydides;<note anchored="yes" n="23">This is indicated by Marcell. &sect; 46. Grote, VI. chap.

              who returned from Sicily without accomplishing their object were punished partly by

              Gilbert, Philologus, 38, p. 251 ff., in which it is shown that there is some
              probability that this Oenobius was son of that Eucles who was in joint command with
              Thuc. when Amphipolis was lost; and that the words here corruptly reported may have
              stated that Oenobius proposed the decree which permitted the return of Thuc. Gilbert
              also infers that Oenobius dedicated a portraitstatue in honour of Thuc., out of
              gratitude for the magnanimity shown by him in not imputing in his history the blame
              for the loss of Amphipolis to the man who was really responsible for it. But these
              inferences are of the most doubtful character.</note> can only thus be understood. If
            he had been simply banished by a decree of the people, the peace of Lysander would of
            itself have given to him, as to other exiles, permission to return home. But if he was
            subject to a severer sentence, there was need of a special decree; and that such was
            made under the rule of the Thirty is not incredible in view of the character of their
            government. Though we may not with Pliny<note anchored="yes" n="26">

            it was due to admiration for his merits as a writer, there can be no doubt that
            Thucydides, having been persecuted by the extreme democratical party, had his friends
            among <pb n="13"/> the ruling faction, to which Oenobius, otherwise unknown, must have
            belonged. His own statement that his exile lasted twenty years, since it must be
            reckoned from the end of B.C. 424, leads us to the last months of 404 for the time of
            his recall. This took place, accordingly, before the Thirty, after the destruction of
            Theramenes, gave themselves up to insolent and wanton violence, at a time when the forms
            of a legal government, and therefore that of recalling by a psephisma, were still
              observed.<note anchored="yes" n="27">There is no reason in the account of Thuc. for
              placing the affair of Amphipolis later than towards the end of 424, since it happened
              at about the same time (iv. 102. &sect; 1) as the battle of Delium, and this took
              place <foreign lang="greek">τοῦ χειμῶνος εὐθὺς ἀρχομένου</foreign> (<bibl n="Thuc. 4.89.1">iv.89.1</bibl>). Kr&uuml;ger (<hi rend="italic">Untersuchungen

              423, and Ullrich (<title>Beitr.</title> p. 136, note 159) makes Thuc. go into
              banishment in the first half of 423, and (p. 148, note 168) not return till after the
              end of the Athenian disorders, i.e. after October, 403. The above assumption, which
              places his return nearly a year earlier, is in exact harmony with his own mention of
              an exile of 20 years, and is, as explained, quite consistent with the <foreign lang="greek">ψήφισμα ἐνίκησεν</foreign> of Pausanias.</note>
          </p>
          <p>The most important fact, however, which we learn from Thucydides himself about his
            exile, and which he wished his readers specially to note for the appreciation of his
            merit as an historian, is this: that, having from the beginning of the war a clear
            insight into its importance, in order to attain the most accurate knowledge, he availed
            himself of every opportunity of personal observation and inspection during those twenty
            years, which brought with them the most important and decisive actions. His course in
            this respect, as he himself describes it in general terms in i. 22. &sect; 2

            with the results of his own knowledge, gains a clearer light from the statement in v.
            26. &sect; 5. He used the period of his banishment to inspect in person the scene of
            events, and took special pains (<foreign lang="greek">οὐχ ἢσσον</foreign>) to visit
            the Peloponnesian lands which would otherwise have been closed to him; and the result of
            his exertions was, <foreign lang="greek">καθ’ ἡσυχίαν τι αὐτῶν μᾶλλον
            αἴσθεσθαι</foreign>, that he attained a clearer insight into the facts by being in
            repose, i.e. remote not only from the party strifes of Athens, but also from the
            excitement which <pb n="14"/> would probably prevail during or immediately after
            occurrences on the spot where they took place.</p>
          <p>In this way, from the scanty notices Thucydides himself has given us of his personal
            relation to the history, we gain a view of his aim and method. In mature
            manhood,&mdash;so the most probable testimony leads us to believe;&mdash;in
            possession of external advantages which secured him a position of independence and
            rendered easy for him an unprejudiced observation and judgment of public affairs and the
            persons engaged in them; penetrated by all the influences of the intellectual culture
            which made Athens at that time the <foreign lang="greek">παίδευσις τῆς
            Ἑλλάδος</foreign>; filled with the conviction that only by the ascendency of truly
            great statesmen and by the moderation and docility of the citizens could his
            mother-city, to which he was devoted with love and admiration, be maintained on her
            eminence; he understood from the very beginning the task of writing the history of this
            war, and at once commenced his preparations for it.</p>
          <p>The first seven years of the war, excepting that time which he necessarily devoted to
            the management of his Thracian property, the <foreign lang="greek">ἐργασία τῶν
              μετάλλων</foreign>, he spent beyond doubt in Athens; and there can be no question
            that he stood in near connexion with the leading statesmen, and was present at the
            deliberations and decisions of the public assemblies. The speeches of Pericles which he
            has given us in outline, and the imperishable testimony he has left (ii. 65) of the
            activity of that great statesman, reflect the vivid impression made on the mind of the
            historian by that mighty personality; and there can be no doubt that at a later time he
            was present as an eye-witness at the discussions about Mitylene (iii. 36-49) and about
            Pylos (iv. 16 ff.); and in all probability he took part in one or more of the
            expeditions which preceded his own <foreign lang="greek">στρατηγία</foreign>, perhaps
            in the naval operations of Phormio in the Corinthian Gulf (ii. 80-92), or the movements
            of Demosthenes in Aetolia and Acarnania (iii. 94 ff.). The statesmen, too, who succeeded
            Pericles, though they failed to replace him, Nicias, Cleon, Demosthenes, he has
            succeeded in placing before our eyes in clear outlines. And the young Alcibiades (born
            B.C. 451), with the brilliancy and haughtiness of his ambitious character, must have
            early attracted his attention, so vividly does he place him before us in <pb n="15"/>
            his later speeches and actions. On the other hand, the twenty years which followed the
            unfortunate result of his <foreign lang="greek">στρατηγία</foreign> in B.C. 424, were
            probably passed by Thucydides, so far as the circumstances of the war allowed, mainly on
            his Thracian property, except at such times as travelling was required by his
            investigations. It is not likely that the change of control, by which in B.C. 412 (viii.
            64) the island of Thasos and the neighbouring coast also probably passed into the
            possession of the Lacedaemonians and was at a later time (<bibl n="Xen. Hell. 1.4.9">Xen. <title>Hell.</title> i.4.9</bibl>) recovered by Thrasybulus for the Athenians,
            interfered at all with his residence there. We are told by Plutarch,<note anchored="yes" n="28">

            conjecture; but it is a conjecture which would be naturally formed by every reader
            acquainted with the circumstances. We can hardly doubt that it was here mainly that he
            carried out the work so early undertaken and prosecuted so uninterruptedly; and this not
            only by the working up of his accumulated materials, but also by the journeys which he
            undertook from thence for the purpose of closer inquiry into the scenes and the events
            of the war. We may assume with certainty that he visited not only the various parts of
            Greece which the war had rendered notable, but also the islands, as well as Italy and
              Sicily.<note anchored="yes" n="30">That Thuc. on the occasion of such visits availed
              himself of native sources of information is shown by E. W&ouml;lfflin,

            delineations of the most important events; and the surprising notice, adduced by
            Marcellinus, &sect; 25, from Timaeus, that after his banishment he lived in Italy
              (<foreign lang="greek">ὡς φυγὼν ᾤκησεν ἐν Ἰταλίᾳ</foreign>), which in

          <p>Unfortunately, we cannot gain any clear insight into the gradual growth and completion
            of this incomparable work. The reason of this is, in part at least, the fact that it was
            not brought to an end by its author. The history suddenly breaks off in the midst of the
            most exciting events of the Ionic-Decelean war. The most natural conjecture as to the
            reason of this, that the author was called away from his work by a sudden death, is
            confirmed by trustworthy evidence. Plutarch says that it was commonly reported that he
            died a violent death in Scapte Hyle.<note anchored="yes" n="31">

              Thrace;<note anchored="yes" n="35">In the confused statement of Marcellinus we must
              adhere to his last unmistakable words: <foreign lang="greek">ἐγὼ δὲ Ζώπυρον
                ληρεῖν νομίζω λέγοντα τοῦτον ἐν Θρᾴκῃ τετελευτηκέναι, κἂν ἀληθεύειν

              energetically. This is the view of Gilbert, Philol. 1879, p. 263.</note> the other,
            for which Didymus is the authority, and which Marcellinus himself adopts, that after his
            return from exile he died and was buried in Athens. The anonymous biographer leaves the
            place of his death undefined, saying, &ldquo;after his death he was buried in
            Athens, near the Melitid gate, . . . whether it was that he himself after the expiration
            of the term of his exile returned to Athens and there died, or that only his bones were
            brought from Thrace after his death there; for both accounts are given.&rdquo;<note anchored="yes" n="36">&sect; 10: <foreign lang="greek">τελευτήσας δ’ ἐν

            examine these statements closely, we see that the assumption that Thucydides died at
            Athens rests only on the well-attested fact of his tomb being found there with an
            often-quoted inscription. For as his death in a foreign land would naturally be
            connected with his continued exile, so an honorable burial in Athens would seem to imply
            that he died there. Pausanias, in order evidently to reconcile the apparent
            contradiction of his death abroad with his well-known tomb in Attica, devised the
            harmonizing story that he perished on his homeward journey, for only this can be the
            meaning of <foreign lang="greek">ὡς κατῄει</foreign>.<note anchored="yes" n="37">That
              these words (see note 25) can have a plpf. meaning, <hi rend="italic">after he had
                returned home</hi>, as Sch&ouml;ne, Jahresbericht, 1874, p. 820, asserts, cannot
              be conceded until a corresponding example is produced.</note> This solution, however,
            cannot be accepted; for Thucydides himself speaks so definitely of the end of his
              banishment&mdash;<foreign lang="greek">ξυνέβη μοι φεύγειν τὴν ἐμαυτοῦ ἔτη
              εἴκοσι</foreign>, which could have been written only after it was over&mdash;and
            he refers so often, and particularly in v. 25 and 26, to the conclusion of the whole
            war, that he must have lived a considerable time after this, and therefore after his
            recall, which was subsequent to it; and accordingly we must seek for some other way of
            explaining the apparent contradiction in the accounts we have. The facts may have been
            as follows: Thucydides returned in the autumn of B.C. 404 to Athens, six months after
            the city had surrendered to Lysander. He himself indicates in i. 93. &sect; 5 that
            the walls round the Piraeus lay in ruins, in accordance with the harsh terms of the
            peace. He can hardly, however, have remained there long, under the increasing severity
            of the rule of the Thirty; and he may probably have sought again the peace and repose of
            his Thracian estate, where he had so long been engaged in the preparation of the
            material he had collected for the history of the war. Though it is probable that large
            portions of his work, particularly such as were prominent and almost independent parts
            of the larger whole,&mdash;e.g. the war of the first ten years to the peace of
            Nicias, and the expedition to Sicily,&mdash;were composed and written down before,
            still, from the even character and unbroken connexion of the eight books as we have
            them, it seems likely that Thucydides gave the whole its present form in a long period
            of repose after the end of the war, which a resi<pb n="18"/> dence in enslaved Athens
            was little calculated to offer. A sudden death overtook him while thus engaged.</p>
          <p>How long a time was granted him for the final revision cannot be defined with
            exactness; but a reasonable inference allows us to fix the year 396 B.C. as the extreme
            limit of his life. In iii. 116. &sect; 2, Thucydides tells us, no doubt after a
            careful inquiry into the facts, that the eruption of Aetna which took place in the
            spring of B.C. 425 was the third on record.<note anchored="yes" n="38">Thuc. mentions
              one as having occurred 50 years before this date, and a third which evidently happened
              at an earlier period. See Ullrich, <title>Beitr. z. Erkl.</title> p. 92.&mdash;A
              second indication of the year of Thucydides' death would be given by <bibl n="Thuc. 4.74.17">iv.74.17</bibl>, where, after the account of the oligarchical
              revolution in Megara, he says: <foreign lang="greek">πλεῖστον δὴ χρόνον αὕτη . .
                . μετάστασις ξυνέμεινεν</foreign>, if we only knew the time at which the
              democratical party again got the upper hand; for it is clear that the words of Thuc.
              point to this. From <bibl n="Xen. Hell. 5.4.41">Xen. <title>Hell.</title>
              v.4.41</bibl>, and Diod. <bibl n="Thuc. 15.40.4">xv.40.4</bibl>, no sure conclusion
              can be gained.&mdash;It is an ingenious remark of Ullrich, <title>Die Hellenischen
                Kriege</title>, p. 16, note, that the remark of Thuc., <bibl n="Thuc. 8.68.14">viii.68.14</bibl>, about Antiphon: <foreign lang="greek">ἄριστα φαίνεται τῶν
                μέχρι ἐμοῦ . . . θανάτου δίκην ἀπολογησάμενος</foreign>, may contain an
              allusion to the apology of Socrates. If this is the case, the passage must have been
              written after B.C. 399, which agrees well with the above assumption. The reason which
              induces Letronne (p. lxvi. of the Didot edition) to place the death of Thuc. before
              402, will be mentioned below.</note> Accordingly the one which occurred in B.C. 396
            (Diod. <bibl n="Thuc. 14.59.3">xiv.59.3</bibl>) could not have been known to him; for as
            he had given attention to the subject, it is hardly likely that he could have remained
            in ignorance of it. We may, therefore, conceive that his life extended to about this
            date, i.e. to his 75th year.<note anchored="yes" n="39">Dahlmann,
              <title>Forschungen</title>, II. p. 125, notices the long-enduring productivity of the
              Greeks in intellectual work under favourable circumstances. Tacitus also had passed
              his 40th year before he began the <title>Historiae</title>, his first large work, and
              it was more than 20 years before he completed the <title>Annals.</title>
            </note> We get in this way a period of from six to seven years during which we may
            imagine that the old man, with that repose and clearness which a powerful spirit obtains
            from many-sided culture in youth and the experience of good and evil fortune in
            maturity, was devoted to his great undertaking and engaged in combining the materials he
            had collected into one completed whole, which with reasonable self-consciousness he
            designates a <foreign lang="greek">κτῆμα ἐς ἀεί</foreign>. It is very possible that
            during these last years Thucydides may have undertaken other journeys and <pb n="19"/>
            have more than once revisited Athens; but it is most natural to suppose that he carried
            on his proper work in the quietness of his Thracian estate.<note anchored="yes" n="40">His acquaintance with local peculiarities on the Thracian coast in the later period
              of his life is shown by <bibl n="Thuc. 4.103.18">iv.103.18</bibl>, where he mentions a
              change in the fortification of Amphipolis since the time of Brasidas.</note> With
            this, too, best agrees the statement that he met a violent death by assassination, which
            is made by Plutarch, Pausanias, and Marcellinus, in reliance on early authorities.<note anchored="yes" n="41">Paus. <foreign lang="greek">δολοφονηθείς</foreign>, Plut.

            kind in Athens is hard to conceive, and could scarcely have remained without
            attestation. On the contrary, an attack by robbers on a lonely and wealthy residence on
            the Thracian coast is easily credible; and thus also is explained the variation in the
            accounts as regards the place; distance sufficiently accounts for the conflicting
            opinions of those not immediately interested.<note anchored="yes" n="42">The conjecture,

                Περίνην τοῦτο καλοῦσιν</foreign>), is not improbable: that Perne in the
              neighbourhood of Scapte Hyle was confused with Perine, opposite Lesbos, which was
              called also Perperene and Parparon.</note> But if Thucydides, as is very probable, was
            slain in Scapte Hyle by the hand of a robber, the second alternative of the anonymous
              biographer<note anchored="yes" n="43">See note 36.</note> is to be accepted, that his
            bones were conveyed to Athens and laid in the sepulchre of Cimon, where Plutarch saw his
            tomb, whether the inscription he quotes be genuine or not: <foreign lang="greek">Θουκυδίδης Ὀλόρου Ἁλιμούσιος ἐνθάδε κεῖται</foreign>. The difficulty
            raised by Didymus as to the unauthorized burial of a banished person in his native soil
            disappears on the hypothesis above given. On the other hand, the suddenness of a death
            by assassination explains fully the condition in which his history remains to us; the
            thread of the narrative is broken off before the end of the twenty-first year of the
            war, in the midst of an account of a subordinate circumstance. The way in which the
            incomplete work was preserved and became known will be discussed later.<note anchored="yes" n="44">A corrupt passage in Marcellinus, &sect; 29, 30, has been

              poets at the court of Archelaus at Pella, and may, therefore, have died and been
              buried in Macedonia. But as no plausible emendation is suggested, and opinions so
              divergent are based upon the passage as it stands, the only legitimate conclusion is
              that we can infer from it nothing either positively or negatively as to the relation

          <p>[Classen at this point proceeds to discuss at length the theory of F. W. Ullrich as to

            1845. This theory may be thus stated nearly in Ullrich's words: Thucydides regarded the
            first ten years of continuous war as terminated by the Peace of Nicias; and accordingly
            after the conclusion of that peace began to compose the history of this war, which by
            itself was sufficiently remarkable: beginning with the preface of the first book, he
            wrote this book, the second, the third, and the first half of the fourth in exile,
            before he could have had knowledge of the later war: then, towards the middle of the
            fourth book,<note anchored="yes" n="45">Ullrich regards the words in <bibl n="Thuc. 4.48.24">iv.48.24</bibl>, <foreign lang="greek">ὅσα γε κατὰ τὸν
                πόλεμον τόνδε</foreign>, as inserted by Thuc. after he had become aware that the
              war had not been really ended by the Peace of Nicias; and they therefore indicate, as
              he thinks, the turning-point from the first to the second aspect of the war, and are
              accordingly in a certain sense the middle point of the work.</note> being overtaken by
            the march of events, when the war between Athens and Sparta began again before Syracuse,
            and was afterwards in the Decelean and Ionian war carried on more actively than before
            through the participation of all the Hellenes including even the Argives and the Greeks
            of Italy and Sicily, he discontinued his work in order to await the result of this
            second war: while these events, however, were taking place, he was constantly making
            preparations for the continuation of his work by collecting information about facts and
            by prosecuting inquiries; and after a break of from ten to eleven years, i.e. from the
            beginning of the Decelean war to his return to Athens, he took up again the thread of
            his narrative. With this view is connected the conjecture that, as Thucydides completed
            the first three books and half the fourth after his banishment and during the Peace of
            Nicias, i.e. in about eight years, so the composition of the second portion, which he
            did not <pb n="21"/> begin till after the conclusion of the whole war, may have required
            about as much more time. This will accord very well with the assumption made that B.C.
            396 must be regarded as the extreme limit of his life.</p>
          <p>Ullrich argues that, on the assumption that Thucydides did not begin the final
            redaction of his work until the end of the twentyseven-years' war, the whole of it must
            have been written with the consciousness of the final result, and could not therefore
            contain any statements which are incompatible with this assumption. Such statements are
            however, according to Ullrich, discoverable in the former part of the history (as far as
            v. 26) and not in the latter; and he infers, therefore, that the former half must have
            been written substantially as we have it between the end of the ten-years' war and the
            Sicilian expedition. He admits, indeed, that these earlier books contain certain
            passages which imply a knowledge of the whole war, but regards them as later insertions
            made by Thucydides himself in the work he had already substantially completed.</p>
          <p>The passages which Ullrich cites, as having been penned by a writer who could not have
            known the final issue of the war, are the following: i. 10. &sect; 2; 23. &sect;
            1-3; ii. 1. &sect; 1; 8. 1; 34. 20; 54. &sect; 3; 57. 7; iii. 86. &sect; 2;
            87. 5; iv. 48. &sect; 5. All of these are fully discussed by Classen, and it is
            shown by him at the least that they come very far short of supporting the inference
            which Ullrich deduces from them. The whole question is discussed with great lucidity and
            fairness by A. Sch&ouml;ne, in <hi rend="italic">Bursian's Jahresbericht</hi>, Vol.
            III. p. 823-848. He is inclined on general grounds of probability to adopt Ullrich's
            opinion as to the actual mode of composition of the history; but of the passages above
            referred to he finds only one (<bibl n="Thuc. 3.87.5">iii.87.5</bibl>) which favours
            decidedly, and another (i. 23. &sect; 1-3) which favours partially the conclusion
            Ullrich bases upon them. Under these circumstances it does not seem worth while to
            reproduce in this edition the lengthy discussion which Classen devotes to the question.
            In giving his adhesion in the main to the view of Ullrich rather than to that of
            Classen, which will be stated immediately, Sch&ouml;ne is influenced to a great
            degree by the consideration (p. 844) that it is improbable that Thucydides, though he
            might have anticipated with a high <pb n="22"/> degree of assurance the failure of the
            Peace of Nicias and a renewal of the war, would have allowed this six-years' period of
            comparative quiet to pass without availing himself of it to work up the materials he had
            already collected for the history of the ten-years' or Archidamian war. But Classen
            nowhere asserts or implies any such neglect of opportunity on the part of the historian.
            Though he believes that the work as it has come down to us took its final form from the
            hand of the writer after the conclusion of the whole war, he admits to the fullest
            extent the probability that portions of it had been worked up into substantially their
            present shape at an earlier period. Such portions may in all likelihood have been those
            which most readily admitted of treatment as wholes, e.g. the Archidamian war and the
            Sicilian expedition.</p>
          <p>In the introduction to the fifth book, where it was necessary to make clear the
            connexion and the special character of it, Classen expresses the following opinion (p.
            3): &ldquo;Though I am convinced that the whole work was written in the shape in
            which we have it after the conclusion of the Peloponnesian war, and that Thucydides was
            called away from life when engaged in the last revision and combination of the portions
            which he had noted down and sketched in outline from the beginning of the war, yet I do
            not believe that all parts of the work received an equally thorough review. I think that
            the masterly introduction, which makes our first book, was first completed with the full
            knowledge of the disastrous result of the twenty-seven-years' war; that then the history
            of the ten-years' war, and the Sicilian expedition, for which it is likely that the
            results of laborious inquiry were already at hand more or less perfectly worked out,
            received their final touches; and that after this, before the thread of the narrative
            was taken up again with the Ionic-Decelean war, the intervening period of the <foreign lang="greek">εἰρήνη ὕπουλος</foreign> was described.&rdquo;</p>
          <p>This opinion as to the mode of the composition of the work of Thucydides rests on two
            simple propositions. (1) Thucydides followed the course of the Peloponnesian war from
            its beginning to its close with minute attention, and committed to writing with more or
            less completeness notes of all its circumstances, particularly of the Archidamian war
            and the Sicilian expedition, which <pb n="23"/> were in themselves relatively distinct
            wholes. (2) After the close of the whole war and his recall from banishment, he took in
            hand the composition of the whole history of the war with a clear view of the relation
            of its several parts; composed the first book as a general introduction to his work; and
            combined into an organic whole the material already collected and partially reduced to
            formal shape, continuing his narrative to the first year of the Ionian war, at which
            point in his labours his life came to an end. Classen's view as above stated agrees in
            the main with that of Kr&uuml;ger, <title>Unterss.</title> p. 74, and
              <title>Epikrit. Nachtr.</title> p. 37.</p>

          <p>The last-mentioned article examines with great minuteness the use of <foreign lang="greek">ὁ πόλεμος</foreign> with and without a demonstrative pronoun; and shows
            that in all the passages where <foreign lang="greek">ὁ πόλεμος ὅδε</foreign> occurs
            in books ii. to v. 24 inclusive the ten-years' war is referred to, though in many places
            a knowledge of the whole war is evidently implied; <pb n="24"/> whereas in book i.
              <foreign lang="greek">ὁ πόλεμος ὅδε</foreign> does not occur at all; but <foreign lang="greek">ὅδε ὁ πόλεμος</foreign> (11 times) and <foreign lang="greek">ὁ
              πόλεμος</foreign> with <foreign lang="greek">οὗτος</foreign> (twice) refer to the
            war the writer is going to describe in opposition to other wars and without thought of
            its duration; and the same is true of the later books where <foreign lang="greek">ὅδε
              ὁ πόλεμος</foreign> occurs. In the later books, vi., vii., viii., <foreign lang="greek">ὁ πόλεμος ὅδε</foreign> refers to the then existing war; whereas
              <foreign lang="greek">ὅδε ὁ πόλεμος</foreign> occurs only three times and
            evidently with the same implication as before. It is also noted that in book v. (39. 19;
            51. 11; 56. 20; 81. 11; 83. 22) in the designation of the successive years of the
              <foreign lang="greek">ὕποπτος ἀνοκωχή</foreign> the demonstrative pronoun is
            omitted as well as the usual mention of the writer; whereas in <bibl n="Thuc. 6.7.25">vi.7.25</bibl> the full formula occurs again. Herbst, therefore, agrees so far with
            Ullrich as to admit that Thucydides regarded the Archidamian (<foreign lang="greek">δεκαετής</foreign>) war as a unit; but argues convincingly that the whole history
            took its present form after the conclusion of the whole war.]</p>
          <p>The extraordinary significance of the history of Thucydides may be recognized in its
            effects. The picture he has drawn for us of a period of history so important and so rich
            in consequences, with its incomparable vividness in the delineation of events and of
            characters, is secure of its place for all time in the memory of mankind, and not only
            surpasses in its life-like truthfulness all other historical narratives of antiquity,
            but is outdone by the work of no modern historian. We become the more sensible of this
            if we compare our knowledge of the period Thucydides has described with that we possess
            of the times immediately preceding or following, or if we endeavour to leave out of our
            conception of the characters he has depicted the traces which are due to him, and to
            realize Pericles and Cleon, Nicias and Alcibiades, from the writings of Xenophon,
            Plutarch, and Diodorus.<note anchored="yes" n="46">Niebuhr, <title>Lectures on Ancient

            The pre-eminent effect of his work, however, is shown by the fact that a series of

            to take up again the material handled by him or to throw it into a different form;

            fastened upon Thucydides, though often with deficient judgment and insight, as the most
            trustworthy source for the period treated by him. Among the Romans the masterly
            character of his work was thoroughly recognized, in spite of the difficulty caused by
            his language and style; his statesmanlike insight attracted them and excited their
            admiration. Sallust exhibits the clearest proofs of conscious imitation; Cornelius Nepos

            style, which is everywhere to be seen in later lexicographical writings. On the other
            hand, the scholastic rhetoric of the later age, as it was practised and brought into
            currency by learned Greeks particularly at Rome, was ill-adapted to comprehend and
            appreciate the most peculiar characteristics of Thucydides, his complete self-surrender
            to his subject and the determination of the form only by the nature of the matter. From
            the most important representative of this tendency, Dionysius of Halicarnassus, we
            possess two treatises (<foreign lang="greek">περὶ τοῦ Θουκυδίδου χαρακτῆρος καὶ

            arrangement of the material or the way in which it is handled and discussed, are wholly
            without value for us. Dionysius has so little conception of the task of history, to
            bring to light the actual course of events as it would disclose itself to unbiassed
            inquiry, that he actually makes it a reproach to Thucydides that he selected as his

            skilful distribution of the material or any proper employment of rhetorical arrangement
            and ornament. In fact in the whole criticism the same contrast finds expression as is to
            be seen between the historical writing of Thucydides and that of Dionysius himself; in
            the latter, a dressing up of facts to suit arbitrary assumptions and subjective
            theories; in the former, an absolute subordination of the record to the facts which are
            to be narrated.</p>
          <p>We have already noticed the circumstances in the life of Thucydides which specially
            favoured him as the writer of the history of his time. With these unusual advantages
            were united all the qualities of mind which go to make up a great historian; of these
            two may be indicated as the most important: the moral earnestness of his view of the
            world and of life, and the temperate good sense of his own nature, by which he maintains
            at all times his simple and incorruptible appreciation of the real truth.</p>
          <p>Thucydides shares with many profound characters a reluctance <pb n="28"/> to expose to
            view and announce in express language his own secret feelings, particularly as regards
            the divine administration of things; but any one who enters with true insight into the
            character of his narrative will recognize everywhere as its fundamental tone a sense,
            that, while man is responsible for his actions, the conduct and decision of human
            affairs is subject to the control of the deity. We shall probably not be mistaken if we
            attribute to the influence of the philosophical conception of the order of the world,
            which Anaxagoras made current among the most prominent men of Athens, that religious
            view which apprehends the agency of the gods not so much in the immediate indications of
            a personal presence, which was so natural to Herodotus and the earlier chroniclers, as
            in a controlling power, which is indeed withdrawn from human sight, yet is nevertheless
            to be reverenced with the feeling of complete dependence. It is true that, in the
            expression of this, the customary language of the popular belief and of the traditional
            forms of worship is not abandoned. The personal name, <foreign lang="greek">θεός,
            θεοί</foreign>, appears most frequently either as a collective designation of those
            generally venerated divinities under whose protection the people feel themselves to be,
            whose feasts they celebrate and by whom they swear (<bibl n="Thuc. 1.71.21">i.71.21</bibl>; 78. 13; <bibl n="Thuc. 2.15.21">ii.15.21</bibl>; 71. 21; <bibl n="Thuc. 3.59.10">iii.59.10</bibl>; <bibl n="Thuc. 4.87.9">iv.87.9</bibl>; <bibl n="Thuc. 5.30.10">v.30.10</bibl>; <bibl n="Thuc. 6.54.29">vi.54.29</bibl>; <bibl n="Thuc. 8.70.5">viii.70.5</bibl>), or in application to particular deities who are
            understood without their being named, as the Delphian Apollo (<bibl n="Thuc. 1.25.3">i.25.3</bibl>; 118. 20; 123. 8; <bibl n="Thuc. 2.54.13">ii.54.13</bibl>; <bibl n="Thuc. 3.92.19">iii.92.19</bibl>; <bibl n="Thuc. 4.118.7">iv.118.7</bibl>; <bibl n="Thuc. 5.32.6">v.32.6</bibl>), Athene (<bibl n="Thuc. 1.126.5">i.126.5</bibl>; <bibl n="Thuc. 2.13.36">ii.13.36</bibl>; 15. 17; <bibl n="Thuc. 4.116.11">iv.116.11</bibl>),
            or the Eumenides, <foreign lang="greek">αἱ σεμναὶ θεαί</foreign>, (<bibl n="Thuc. 1.126.37">i.126.37</bibl>). Only once, in a Boeotian religious formula, is
              <foreign lang="greek">δαίμονες</foreign> used for <foreign lang="greek">θεοί</foreign>, (<bibl n="Thuc. 4.97.17">iv.97.17</bibl>). Yet the belief which rises
            above the forms of special worship to the general conception of divine government finds
            distinct expression in some places. It is to the writer an infallible symptom of extreme
            disturbance in the order of society if awe of the divine is broken down, whether, as in
            ii. 53. &sect; 4, this is the result of the fearful plague at Athens (<foreign lang="greek">θεῶν φόβος ἢ ἀνθρώπων νόμος οὐδεὶς ἀπεῖργε</foreign>), or, as
            in iii. 82. &sect; 6, of the virulence of party hatred (<foreign lang="greek">τὰς
              ἐς σφᾶς αὐτοὺς πίστεις οὐ τῷ θείῳ νόμῳ μᾶλλον ἐκρατύνοντο ἢ τῷ
              κοινῇ τι παρανομῆσαι</foreign>). In the remarkable debate between the Athenian
            envoys and the council of the Melians (v. 85. ff.), on the one side the consciousness of
            a good <pb n="29"/> cause manifests itself by confidence in protection from above
              (<foreign lang="greek">τὸ θεῖον</foreign>), and on the other the exaltation of brute
            strength above every other consideration shows how the sense of right and wrong had
            become confused. In the same sense Nicias in his last speech (<bibl n="Thuc. 7.77.17">vii.77.17</bibl>) is represented as basing his hope on this <foreign lang="greek">θεῖον</foreign>. The real sentiment of Thucydides is expressed in the noble words
            with which Pericles (<bibl n="Thuc. 2.64.9">ii.64.9</bibl>) urges his fellow-citizens to
            meet the uncertain future: <foreign lang="greek">φέρειν χρὴ τά τε δαιμόνια
              ἀναγκαίως τά τε ἀπὸ τῶν πολεμίων ἀνδρείως</foreign>. What in this
            passage&mdash;and only here&mdash;probably with some allusion to the language of
            the philosophers&mdash;is called <foreign lang="greek">τὰ δαιμόνια</foreign>, i.e.
            everything which in the life of man is sent by a higher hand and is withdrawn from the
            calculation and control of human prudence, Thucydides usually embraces under the term
              <foreign lang="greek">τύχη</foreign>, as an operative power, and <foreign lang="greek">τύχαι</foreign> as the manifestation of it; the former in <bibl n="Thuc. 1.140.11">i.140.11</bibl>; 144. 24; <bibl n="Thuc. 2.42.25">ii.42.25</bibl>;

              in the English <hi rend="italic">Journal of Philology,</hi> VII. p. 112.</note> It is
            of no importance for a critical examination of Thucydides's use of language whether
            these expressions are found in his own narrative or are placed by him in the mouths of
            his speaking characters. Everywhere we are to understand by <foreign lang="greek">τύχη</foreign> a power superior to man, which is not blind chance, but exercises
            control in accordance with a higher order; on which man can never calculate, but the
            operation of which he cannot without damage disregard. If <foreign lang="greek">τύχη</foreign> is opposed to <foreign lang="greek">γνώμη</foreign>, as in <bibl n="Thuc. 1.144.24">i.144.24</bibl>; <bibl n="Thuc. 5.75.12">v.75.12</bibl>, this is
            from the human point of view, which finds its calculations at fault; but it is by no
            means intended to assert the superiority of the latter. In the remarkable declaration on
            the death of Nicias (<bibl n="Thuc. 7.86.24">vii.86.24</bibl>), <foreign lang="greek">ἥκιστα δὴ ἄξιος ὢν τῶν γε ἐπ’ ἐμοῦ</foreign>
            <pb n="30"/>
            <foreign lang="greek">Ἑλλήνων ἐς τοῦτο δυστυχίας ἀφικέσθαι διὰ τὴν πᾶσαν ἐς
              ἀρετὴν νενομισμένην ἐτιτήδευσιν</foreign>, Thucydides does not conceal that it
            will not always be easy for the human understanding to reconcile itself to the
            incomprehensible administration of the divine omnipotence. It is characteristic that
            nowhere is <foreign lang="greek">τύχη</foreign> more distinctly referred to its divine
            source than by the Melians in their fruitless struggle against the doctrine of the right
            of the strongest. Twice, <bibl n="Thuc. 5.104.4">v.104.4</bibl>; 112. 7, we find the
            significant expression <foreign lang="greek">ἡ τύχη ἐκ τοῦ θείου</foreign>.</p>
          <p>In the view of the world which all these passages imply there is unmistakably a pious
            feeling of dependence on the divine power, though any deeper penetration into the laws
            and relations of its operation is not granted to man. And while it is the aim of the
            writer in the spirit of Anaxagoras to inquire into the causes of surprising
            incidents,&mdash;as of the eclipse of the sun, <bibl n="Thuc. 2.28.2">ii.28.2</bibl>; of a flood consequent upon an earthquake, <bibl n="Thuc. 3.89.18">iii.89.18</bibl>; of the eclipse of the moon, in contrast with the superstitious
            terror (<foreign lang="greek">θειασμός</foreign>) of Nicias, <bibl n="Thuc. 7.50.27">vii.50.27</bibl>; of violent tempests, in contrast with the alarm of the dispirited
            Athenians, <bibl n="Thuc. 7.79.10">vii.79.10</bibl>;&mdash;still he does not venture
            to draw the line between the province of positive human knowledge and that where the
            obscure operation of the gods makes itself felt in human things. Accordingly, while he
            is far from unconditionally ascribing validity to omens and oracles, and even allows
            himself to make a critical examination of their true meaning (<bibl n="Thuc. 2.17.11">ii.17.11</bibl>; 54. 9), and in <bibl n="Thuc. 5.16.21">v.16.21</bibl> plainly admits
            the assumption that even the utterances of the Delphian oracles could be corruptly
            procured, still his bringing forward instances of omens and oracles actually verified
              (<bibl n="Thuc. 5.26.20">v.26.20</bibl>; <bibl n="Thuc. 6.27.9">vi.27.9</bibl>), and
            in general his frequent mention of predictions, portents, and marvellous occurrences
              (<bibl n="Thuc. 1.118.21">i.118.21</bibl>; 134. 18; <bibl n="Thuc. 2.8.7">ii.8.7</bibl>; 77. 22; 102. 27; <bibl n="Thuc. 3.88.8">iii.88.8</bibl>; 92. 18; 96. 3;
            104. 2; <bibl n="Thuc. 4.52.1">iv.52.1</bibl>; <bibl n="Thuc. 5.32.6">v.32.6</bibl>; 45.
            20; <bibl n="Thuc. 6.70.2">vi.70.2</bibl>), proves that he does not mean to deny the
            possibility of supernatural operations. Just as he views <foreign lang="greek">τύχαι</foreign>, so he allows to the supersensible world no influence over the
            judgment and action of men, and therefore for practical purposes leaves it out of
            account. It is very intelligible to him that in times of excitement men should look
            about for miraculous instruction (<bibl n="Thuc. 2.8.7">ii.8.7</bibl>) or help (<bibl n="Thuc. 2.47.15">ii.47.15</bibl>); but he himself attaches no importance to such
            things, and <pb n="31"/> has had no experience of useful results therefrom; and his real
            opinion would probably coincide with that of the Athenian envoys, <bibl n="Thuc. 5.103.7">v.103.7</bibl>, whose advice to the Melians is: <foreign lang="greek">μὴ ὁμοιωθῆναι τοῖς πολλοῖς, οἷς παρὸν ἀνθρωπείως ἔτι
              σῴζεσθαι, ἐπειδὰν πιεζομένους αὐτοὺς ἐπιλίπωσιν αἱ φανεραὶ ἐλπίδες, ἐπὶ
              τὰς ἀφανεῖς καθίστανται, μαντικήν τε καὶ χρησμοὺς καὶ ὅσα τοιαῦτα μετ’
              ἐλπίδων λυμαίνεται</foreign>.</p>
          <p>Clearness and definiteness were essential to Thucydides; and accordingly the proper
            sphere of his observation and inquiry was man, his action and his history. The less he
            tried to penetrate into the secret course of the divine government of the world, so much
            the more earnest was he to attain the most exact knowledge of everything which makes up
            the life of man; the motives of his action as well as their external manifestation; the
            efforts and conduct of individuals as well as the great movements which take place in
            the life of states. His judgment of human affairs, however, is controlled by one
            principle, that it is power of mind which makes up the value of the individual, just as
            it conditions the result of every activity.</p>
          <p>With decision and clearness Thucydides recognizes the opposition between body and
            spirit, which found its most definite expression in Anaxagoras. He is fully alive to the
            weakness of human nature, and often insists upon its limitations (e.g. <bibl n="Thuc. 3.45.30">iii.45.30</bibl>; 84. 10; <bibl n="Thuc. 5.68.6">v.68.6</bibl>); and
            yet he is penetrated with the conviction that the spirit of man can attain the mastery
            over the agitating influences of the surrounding world and nature, and is competent in
            large measure to define and shape its own life as well as the fortunes of states. The
            views of Thucydides may thus have been influenced by the doctrines of Anaxagoras; yet
            his use of language manifests independence, and deserves a special examination so far as
            it touches the phenomena of the mind. The centre of all the mental power of man is for
            Thucydides the power of thought and cognition, from which come the energetic will and
            resolutions which press to action. This power, however, is not called <foreign lang="greek">νοῦς</foreign>, which word occurs in Thucydides only in the less
            pregnant sense of the perceiving and observing faculty,<note anchored="yes" n="60">Cf.

            author a very wide range of meaning. It includes the aggregate of psychical powers,

            however, it denotes on the intellectual side insight and cognition in general (cf. <bibl n="Thuc. 1.70.10">i.70.10</bibl>; 75. 2; 77. 9; 91. 25; <bibl n="Thuc. 2.13.21">ii.13.21</bibl>; 34. 17; 43. 21; 62. 30; 65. 32; <bibl n="Thuc. 3.37.21">iii.37.21</bibl>; 83. 4; etc.); or a view, opinion, judgment, in reference to a

            and its compounds with <foreign lang="greek">διά, ἐπί, κατά, μετά, πρό</foreign>,
            is used sometimes with an intellectual meaning, <hi rend="italic">apprehend,
            understand</hi> (cf. <bibl n="Thuc. 1.25.1">i.25.1</bibl>; 36. 3; 86. 2; 91. 5; 102. 15;

            it is notable that while <foreign lang="greek">νοῦς</foreign> remains on the lower
            plane, <foreign lang="greek">διάνοια</foreign> is placed nearly on a par with <foreign lang="greek">γνώμη</foreign>, as well in the sense of a perfected intellectual power
            and state of mind (cf. <bibl n="Thuc. 2.43.3">ii.43.3</bibl>; 61. 12; 89. 23; <bibl n="Thuc. 5.111.9">v.111.9</bibl>; <bibl n="Thuc. 6.15.15">vi.15.15</bibl>; 21. 3;

            a language; but the adjective <foreign lang="greek">ξυνετός</foreign> is his usual word

              <foreign lang="greek">νοεῖν</foreign> no corresponding epithet is formed; and
              <foreign lang="greek">σοφός</foreign> occurs only in <bibl n="Thuc. 3.37.19">iii.37.19</bibl> with the unfavourable sense of <hi rend="italic">crafty,

Thucydides uses <foreign lang="greek">φρονεῖν</foreign> absolutely only a few times (<bibl n="Thuc. 5.7.10">v.7.10</bibl>; <bibl n="Thuc. 6.89.26">vi.89.26</bibl>; <foreign lang="greek">φρονεῖν τι</foreign>, <hi rend="italic">have insight</hi>); elsewhere with defining

              <foreign lang="greek">φρόνιμος</foreign>: but <foreign lang="greek">φρόνημα</foreign> occurs in the sense of <hi rend="italic">self-consciousness,

            a wide as well as in a restricted sense; and only as derived from this has it sometimes
            the meaning of an expressed reason (cf. <bibl n="Thuc. 1.76.14">i.76.14</bibl>; <bibl n="Thuc. 2.101.13">ii.101.13</bibl>; <bibl n="Thuc. 5.18.57">v.18.57</bibl>; 98. 2;

            also <bibl n="Thuc. 1.102.16">i.102.16</bibl>). This last meaning of a reasonable
            consideration or calculation is distinctly prominent in the phrases <foreign lang="greek">κατὰ λόγον</foreign> (cf. <bibl n="Thuc. 2.89.25">ii.89.25</bibl>;

            of the basis of morality he must in one important point have approximated closely to
            that of his great contemporary Socrates. As he referred all human virtue to knowledge
            and therefore regarded it as capable of being taught and learnt, so with Thucydides the
            capacity of men on which he <pb n="35"/> sets the highest value rests first of all on
            clearness and acuteness of insight, which judges correctly the existing relations of
            things, and thus is able to take a sure glance into the future. See especially the
            description of Themistocles, i. 138, in whom the <foreign lang="greek">οἰκεία
            ξύνεσις</foreign> resulted in his being not only <foreign lang="greek">κράτιστος
              γνώμων τῶν παραχρῆμα</foreign> but also <foreign lang="greek">ἄριστος εἰκαστὴς
              τοῦ γενησομένου</foreign>. Pericles also is <foreign lang="greek">λέγειν καὶ
              πράσσειν δυνατώτατος</foreign> (<bibl n="Thuc. 1.139.24">i.139.24</bibl>) because he
            is <foreign lang="greek">γνώμῃ ξυνετός</foreign> (<bibl n="Thuc. 2.34.17">ii.34.17</bibl>, 22), and because, as being <foreign lang="greek">δυνατὸς τῷ τε
              ἀξιώματι καὶ τῇ γνώμῃ</foreign> (<bibl n="Thuc. 2.65.31">ii.65.31</bibl>), he
            had clearly foreseen the importance of the war (<bibl n="Thuc. 2.65.21">ii.65.21</bibl>,
              <foreign lang="greek">προγνοὺς τὴν δύναμιν . . . ἐγνώσθη ἡ πρόνοια αὐτοῦ ἐς
              τὸν πόλεμον</foreign>). Out of a right understanding flow all the qualities on which
            efficient action depends, and chiefly self-control and moderation (<foreign lang="greek">ἡ σωφροσύνη</foreign>: <bibl n="Thuc. 1.32.16">i.32.16</bibl>; 68. 3; 84. 5, 12;

            16; <bibl n="Thuc. 6.11.29">vi.11.29</bibl>; 79. 9; 87. 20; <bibl n="Thuc. 8.24.21">viii.24.21</bibl>); this forms the basis of all moral order, and is lost if the
            passions are allowed to rule. Thucydides gives us in iii. 82, on the occasion of the
            party warfare in Corcyra, a grand picture of the utter disturbance of all the relations
            of life which takes its rise from confusion of ideas. As long as <foreign lang="greek">αἵ τε πόλεις καὶ οἱ ἰδιῶται ἀμείνους τὰς γνώμας ἔχοισι</foreign> (<bibl n="Thuc. 3.82.15">iii.82.15</bibl>), matters of external order are maintained with
            stability; but when the <foreign lang="greek">ὀργαὶ τῶν πολλῶν</foreign> take the
            place of <foreign lang="greek">γνώμη</foreign>, all discipline and morality are
            overthrown. Again, it is no doubt the writer's own conviction which he puts into the
            mouth of Pericles (<bibl n="Thuc. 2.40.11">ii.40.11</bibl>), <foreign lang="greek">διαφερόντως καὶ τόδε ἔχομεν ὥστε τολμᾶν τε οἱ αὐτοὶ μάλιστα καὶ περὶ
              ὧν ἐπιχειρήσομεν ἐκλογίζεσθαι ὃ τοῖς ἄλλοις ἀμαθία μὲν θράσος,
              λογισμὸς δὲ ὄκνον φέρει</foreign>. On the other hand it is an indication of the
            vulgarity of Cleon's character that he considers that that state has the surest basis in
            which the citizens unite want of knowledge and culture, <foreign lang="greek">ἀμαθία</foreign>, with <foreign lang="greek">σωφροσύνη</foreign>, which last in such
            a connexion is degraded to a stupid indifference.</p>
          <p>It is the natural result of a correct insight to recognize that righteousness, regard
            namely for law and contracts and the performance of duty, is the surest support of civil
            order and the reciprocal relations of states. The general term to express this is
              <foreign lang="greek">τὸ δίκαιον</foreign> (cf. <bibl n="Thuc. 1.25.11">i.25.11</bibl>; <bibl n="Thuc. 3.10.1">iii.10.1</bibl>; 47. 18; 56. 8; 82. 61; <bibl n="Thuc. 4.61.15">iv.61.15</bibl>; 62. 11; <bibl n="Thuc. 5.86.6">v.86.6</bibl>; 90.
            2; 107. 2; <bibl n="Thuc. 6.79.1">vi.79.1</bibl>); while the abstract <pb n="36"/>
            <foreign lang="greek">δικαιοσύνη</foreign> occurs only in <bibl n="Thuc. 3.63.21">iii.63.21</bibl>. But since in human affairs it is only seldom that right and wrong
            can be estimated with perfect exactness, the recognition and defence of one's own
            interest is a necessary condition of self-preservation. Not only Cleon (iii. 37. ff.)
            but also Diodotus (iii. 42. ff.) maintains the policy of interest; and even the
            Plataeans seek to move the Spartans to mercy (iii. 56. &sect; 7) by the apprehension
            of their real advantage. But how little Thucydides sympathized with the cynical doctrine
            of the right of the stronger which the Athenians proclaim in their dialogue with the
            Melians (v. 85-113) is shown unmistakably by the manner in which he allows it to be
            displayed in all its revolting recklessness at that very point in his narrative where
            the Athenian empire received its last petty accession, and the Sicilian expedition was
            about to be undertaken which was destined to result in its overthrow. He rather shows
            with abundant clearness the high regard he has for that temper which even in political
            matters gives a hearing not merely to strict right but also to considerations of
            humanity and compassion. This magnanimity, which does not allow the weaker to feel the
            full weight of superior power, but rather lays him under obligation by benefit, is
            called by him chiefly <foreign lang="greek">ἀρετή</foreign> (cf. <bibl n="Thuc. 1.37.8">i.37.8</bibl>; 69. 8; <bibl n="Thuc. 2.40.18">ii.40.18</bibl>; 51.
            20; 71. 18; <bibl n="Thuc. 3.10.1">iii.10.1</bibl>; 56. 27; 57. 10; 58. 2; <bibl n="Thuc. 4.19.12">iv.19.12</bibl>; 81. 10; 86. 19; <bibl n="Thuc. 5.105.16">v.105.16</bibl>; <bibl n="Thuc. 6.54.21">vi.54.21</bibl>). Compassion and mercy are in
            his eyes noble feelings. It is true that he makes Cleon reject them with unfeeling
            roughness (<bibl n="Thuc. 3.40.6">iii.40.6</bibl>, <foreign lang="greek">μὴ τρισὶ
              τοῖς ἀξυμφορωτάτοις τῇ ἀρχῇ, οἴκτῳ καὶ ἡδονῇ λόγων καὶ ἐπιεικείᾳ,
              ἁμαρτάνειν</foreign>); but where they are recklessly outraged, the tone of his
            narration allows his condemnatory judgment to be felt, e.g. in the execution of the
            Plataeans, iii. 68, and in the mournful fate of the captured Athenians, vii. 86, 87. Not
            less clearly does Thucydides represent the motive of honour as a noble and worthy one in
            the dealings of men. The feeling itself he calls <foreign lang="greek">αἰδώς</foreign>
            in <bibl n="Thuc. 1.84.12">i.84.12</bibl>; in other places <foreign lang="greek">αἰσχύνη</foreign> (cf. <bibl n="Thuc. 1.84.12">i.84.12</bibl>; <bibl n="Thuc. 2.51.20">ii.51.20</bibl>; <bibl n="Thuc. 4.19.15">iv.19.15</bibl>; <bibl n="Thuc. 5.104.8">v.104.8</bibl>; 111. 16); and he sets high value upon it, just as in
            his finest speeches he gives a prominent place to a regard for fame among contemporaries
            and posterity (cf. ii. 41. &sect; 4; 64. 27; iii. 57. &sect; 2). A noble
            bearing, which unselfishly keeps in view the <pb n="37"/> higher aims of human life, is
            described by Thucydides chiefly as <foreign lang="greek">καλόν</foreign> (cf. <bibl n="Thuc. 1.38.10">i.38.10</bibl>; <bibl n="Thuc. 2.35.2">ii.35.2</bibl>; 53. 9; 64.
            28; <bibl n="Thuc. 3.42.12">iii.42.12</bibl>; 55. 11; 94. 16; <bibl n="Thuc. 4.126.26">iv.126.26</bibl>; <bibl n="Thuc. 5.46.7">v.46.7</bibl>; 69. 10; 107. 2; <bibl n="Thuc. 6.79.8">vi.79.8</bibl>; <bibl n="Thuc. 7.70.46">vii.70.46</bibl>; 71. 4;
              <bibl n="Thuc. 8.2.8">viii.2.8</bibl>; 12. 8), and the opposite character by <foreign lang="greek">αἰσχρόν</foreign> (cf. <bibl n="Thuc. 1.38.12">i.38.12</bibl>; 122. 16;
              <bibl n="Thuc. 2.40.4">ii.40.4</bibl>; 64. 29; <bibl n="Thuc. 3.42.11">iii.42.11</bibl>; 58. 5; <bibl n="Thuc. 4.20.6">iv.20.6</bibl>; <bibl n="Thuc. 6.21.7">vi.21.7</bibl>; <bibl n="Thuc. 7.48.28">vii.48.28</bibl>); in which we see a
            preparation for the more strictly ethical usage of Plato. The combination <foreign lang="greek">καλὸς κἀγαθός</foreign>, which became so current at a later time,
            Thucydides uses once (<bibl n="Thuc. 4.40.8">iv.40.8</bibl>) in a moral sense, and once
              (<bibl n="Thuc. 8.48.37">viii.48.37</bibl>) as a designation of the aristocratical
            party.</p>
          <p>But while Thucydides thus concedes the fullest right to moral worth and the nobler
            sentiments of humanity, he yet finds the highest quality of a statesman in the
            controlling power of the thinking mind, in <foreign lang="greek">γνώμη</foreign> or
              <foreign lang="greek">ξύνεσις</foreign>, which gives a clear insight into the reality
            of things. Only by help of this do all the other qualities appear in their true import.
            It is in Pericles that this power is seen most conspicuously. As in his first speech (i.
            140-144) he sweeps away all the self-deception of peace-loving optimists and shows that
            with the position of parties in Greece war is inevitable, so his last speech (ii. 60-64)
            contains incontrovertible evidence that his estimate of the power of Athens for the
            attainment of the end in view was perfectly correct, if only it was employed with
            composure and steadiness; and Thucydides himself, in view of the later events, adds his
            own confirmation of the words of the orator (ii. 65. &sect; 7 ff.).</p>
          <p>This same quality, which he had learnt by his own observation to admire in the great
            statesman&mdash;the calm consideration of reality and the clear recognition of its
            importance in things as well as persons,&mdash;it is this which he has himself
            striven after as the highest for his own task of writing history. A simple unbeguiled
            feeling for the real truth controls his apprehension of things&mdash;his judgment of
            the actions of men and their results, as well as his delineation itself, both in its
            general method and in the details of form and expression. With this intelligent
            appreciation of the relation of things he recognized the importance of the impending war
            at its very beginning; and devoted the closest attention to the ascertainment of all its
            events. He asserts this himself in <pb n="38"/>
            <bibl n="Thuc. 1.1.3">i.1.3</bibl> (<foreign lang="greek">ἀρξάμενος εὐθύς</foreign>,
            sc. <foreign lang="greek">ξυγγράφειν</foreign>, where the verb is to be understood of
            the collection of material and of every sort of preparation) and also in i. 22, where he
            depicts his zealous diligence and strict conscientiousness in making use of every source
            of information; and once more in v. 26. &sect; 4, where he repeats that from the
            beginning of the war he found himself in a position to observe its course with judicious
            scrutiny, that he kept his eyes open at all times for what was remarkable, and that he
            used the period of his twenty years' exile in visiting the scenes of the war, on the
            Peloponnesian side as well as the Athenian, and in uninterrupted inquiry. As therefore
            he had at his command under the most favourable circumstances all the means for
            enlarging and certifying his knowledge of the real relations of things, so in his mental
            culture and in his experience and knowledge of affairs<note anchored="yes" n="62">Niebuhr, <title>Lectures on Ancient History</title>, III. p. 168: &ldquo;A man
              who has taken no part in administration cannot write history. No great historian can
              be developed in the closet. A really able historian must have seen the
              world.&rdquo;</note> he possessed all that was requisite for applying the standard
            of a just judgment to the persons engaged. The necessity he felt to see even things
            remote in time and space in the light of their real existtence is shown especially when
            he seeks to reduce to their true value the traditional reports of legend and poetry (cf.
            i. 10, 11; ii. 15; 102; vi. 2); he endeavours by the help of facts (<foreign lang="greek">τοῖς ἔργοις</foreign>, <bibl n="Thuc. 1.11.18">i.11.18</bibl>) to
            oppose the reality of events to <foreign lang="greek">φήμη</foreign> and to the
              <foreign lang="greek">διὰ τοὺς ποιητὰς περὶ αὐτῶν κατεσχηκὼς λόγος</foreign>,
            and if exact proof cannot be brought forward for the true opinion, he does his best to
            attain the <foreign lang="greek">εἰκός</foreign> (cf. <bibl n="Thuc. 1.10.20">i.10.20</bibl>, 29; <bibl n="Thuc. 2.48.10">ii.48.10</bibl>), as one of the most
            important criteria for the historical inquirer. This unceasing demand of Thucydides for
            the real facts is no doubt the reason why he shows himself incredulous and even unjust
            to Epic poetry. He handles it only in reference to its historical contents, and its
            indispensable <foreign lang="greek">ἐπὶ τὸ μεῖζον κοσμεῖν</foreign> (<bibl n="Thuc. 1.10.20">i.10.20</bibl>; 21. 3) is to him only a disfigurement of the truth.
            He seeks not for any other ground of its value. So he feels himself in direct opposition
            to the work of the so-called logographers which precedes his own, because it aims
              <foreign lang="greek">ἐπὶ τὸ προσαγωγότερον τῇ ἀκροάσει ἢ
            ἀληθέστερον</foreign>, and with full consciousness that his work will suffer in its
            entertaining <pb n="39"/> qualities, he claims for it (i. 22. &sect; 4) the higher
            merit of setting forth the unadorned reality, feeling assurance however that it will be

          <p>This whole mass of historical material he lays before his readers with the utmost truth

            arrange and mould it according to his own notions of propriety, but allows it to unfold
            and develop itself. The living picture which he sees of the course of events and of the
            way in which they were influenced by the persons engaged in them he cannot help
            embodying in a narrative which by the simplest means is charged with life and truth. If
            we examine his most famous delineations,&mdash;the siege of Plataea (ii. 71-78), the
            escape of the Plataeans (iii. 20-24), the battles in the Corinthian gulf (ii. 83-92),

            advance from day to day and leaves no gap in their natural sequence, so that we receive
            the impression of being actual witnesses of them.<note anchored="yes" n="65">Plutarch,

            little in common with the easy-going manner of Herodotus, who at every turn breaks off
            the thread of his story to introduce as an episode some circumstance of which he has
            been reminded. The few digressions which we find in Thucydides (i. 126; 128 ff.; <pb n="40"/> 135 ff.; ii. 15; 96 f.; 99 f.; iii. 104; vi. 1 ff.; 54 ff.) have always a
            definite occasion and contribute materially to a correct judgment of the circumstances
            narrated.</p>
          <p>It is with the view of keeping as close as possible in his narrative to the actual
            course of events that Thucydides made use of the division of time that he has employed.
            This is neither that of the astronomical nor that of the civil year, but one which
            corresponds to the actual conditions of the carrying on of war; the larger part of the
            year, in which the weather permits freely all operations and especially maritime ones,
            is opposed to the shorter portion, in which all more important undertakings must be
            suspended. He narrates therefore <foreign lang="greek">κατὰ θέρη καὶ

            distributed over two unequal periods, which may vary in length according to the
            conditions of the seasons. This is the meaning of the expression in <bibl n="Thuc. 5.20.11">v.20.11</bibl>, <foreign lang="greek">ἐξ ἡμισείας ἑκατέρου τοῦ

          <p>In his delineation of persons Thucydides shows them to us in their actions, in the part
            they take in the promotion of decisive resolutions and in the carrying out of plans
            adopted. He is sparing indeed in the expression of any definite judgments of his own
            about prominent men;&mdash;we have only, among the contemporaries of the
            Peloponnesian war, the brief description of Archidamus, <bibl n="Thuc. 1.79.8">i.79.8</bibl>; of Pericles, ii. 65. &sect; 5 ff.; of Cleon, <bibl n="Thuc. 3.36.27">iii.36.27</bibl>; <bibl n="Thuc. 4.21.9">iv.21.9</bibl>; <bibl n="Thuc. 5.16.5">v.16.5</bibl>; of Brasidas, <bibl n="Thuc. 2.25.13">ii.25.13</bibl>; iv. 81.

            casual notices,&mdash;but every susceptible reader will find that the plain
            narrative of their actions sets the persons engaged vividly before us. The transactions
            themselves are so naturally developed that, as if we were eye-witnesses, we cannot help
            forming a judgment about the men we read of as to their skill or incapacity, their
            profound insight or their intellectual poverty, the purity of their characters or the
            duplicity of their motives, their energetic decisiveness or their hesitating
            irresolution. Besides this, however, Thucydides uses with the greatest effect another
            means of vivid presentation, which was not indeed used first by him, but which he
            employed in the most masterly way, that namely of introducing speeches supposed to be
            made by the most important personages, wherein they give expression to their innermost
            thoughts and the motives of their actions. <pb n="42"/>
          </p>
          <p>The employment of direct speech as a means of expressing feelings and thoughts formed
            the most effective mode of presentation in the Epic poetry of Homer, and reached its
            highest freedom and completeness in the Attic drama. The same method was resorted to
            with the happiest results also in the most strict historical writing to give expression
            to the inner side of the transactions recorded; and it may be added that, as this method
            gives objective utterance to the psychological side of historical representation, so in
            philosophical dialogue the clearest statement of the dialectical development of thought
            was effected in the same way. Thucydides sets himself to adhere as exactly as possible
            to the speeches actually delivered; of this his own words in i. 22. &sect; 1 leave
            no doubt. But that this effort is directed rather to the thoughts than to the form of
            what was said he states himself distinctly in the words <foreign lang="greek">ἐχομένῳ
              ὅτι ἐγγύτατα τῆς ξυμπάσης γνώμης τῶν ἀληθῶς λεχθέντων</foreign>. Indeed at
            this time a verbally accurate report of the words uttered is not conceivable. In
            default, therefore, of an exact account of the language actually used Thucydides
            supplied what was lacking, <foreign lang="greek">ὡς ἂν ἐδόκουν αὐτῷ ἕκαστοι
              περὶ τῶν ἀεὶ παρόντων τὰ δέοντα μάλιστ’ εἰπεῖν</foreign>. In the free use of
            this principle he allows himself to bring forward a speaker to controvert views and
            reasons which have been put forth by a different speaker at another place and time. We
            find unmistakable examples of this sort in the speech of the Corinthian ambassadors, i.
            120. ff., as compared with that of Archidamus, i. 80. ff., and in the first speech of
            Pericles, i. 140. ff., in reference to the Corinthian speech just mentioned. So there
            can be little doubt that to the writer is due the reservation of a part of his material
            which Pericles announces in <bibl n="Thuc. 1.144.5">i.144.5</bibl> (<foreign lang="greek">ἀλλ’ ἐκεῖνα μὲν ἐν ἄλλῳ λόγῳ ἅμα τοῖς ἔργοις
            δηλωθήσεται</foreign>) and its subsequent introduction in ii. 13. &sect; 2 ff. It
            is a natural result, therefore, of this mode of treatment that, while the language of
            the Thucydidean speeches, both in the structure of sentences and in particular
            expressions, has a uniform character, viz., that of the writer, still in each separate
            speech the character and mode of thought of the assumed speaker are clearly manifested.
            This is true of all the speeches without exception, and no less so of the debate between
            the Athenian envoys and the representatives of the island of Melos (<foreign lang="greek">οἱ τῶν</foreign>
            <pb n="43"/>
            <foreign lang="greek">Μηλίων ξύνεδροι</foreign>), v. 85-111. Grote,<note anchored="yes" n="69">
              <title>Hist. of Greece</title>, VI. chap. 56, p. 379 (1870). &ldquo;There is
              indeed every reason for concluding that what we here read in Thucydides is in far
              larger proportion his own and in smaller proportion authentic report, than any other
              of the speeches which he professes to set down.&rdquo;</note> it is true, has
            great doubts of the accuracy of this report, and ascribes the larger part of it to the
            &ldquo;dramatic genius and arrangement&rdquo; of the writer. But we may very
            well assume that on this occasion a report or minute of the discussion was made by the
            Athenian deputies and generals, which was kept in the archives of the senate at Athens
            and of which Thucydides even in his own absence could have obtained an accurate
            knowledge, as he did of other documents which he records and of the letter of Nicias,
            vii. 11-15. We may assume also in regard to reports of shorter utterances, that they
            rest upon authentic transmission. Cf. iii. 113. &sect; 2 ff.; viii. 53. &sect;
            3; <bibl n="Thuc. 2.12.14">ii.12.14</bibl>. The few statements of this character, which
            are introduced in direct or indirect speech, have the effect of great vividness and
            present to us an important crisis with high distinctness. When, however, events develop
            themselves in rapid succession and the press of circumstances forbids the employment of
            set speeches, the brief and condensed <hi rend="italic">r&eacute;sum&eacute;s</hi> of what was said serve to enliven the narrative.
            Compare the considerable extracts from the second speech of Pericles, ii. 13; from
            Cleon's speeches, iv. 22. and 28. It is probably for this reason that in the eighth
            book, when the changes are so rapid and the character of many transactions there
            recorded is so peculiar that they did not lend themselves to formal treatment, the
            thoughts and purposes of the agents are communi-cated indirectly (cf. viii. 27; 46; 53;
            63; 67; 76; 81) and we find no complete speeches.<note anchored="yes" n="70">Cf.
              Niebuhr. <title>Lectures</title>, II. p. 35 ff.; Kr&uuml;ger,
              <title>Unterss.</title> p. 79. Yet the latter is no doubt right in observing that in
              the eighth book we miss more than elsewhere the last revision of the author.</note>
          </p>
          <p>But more than all by his use of speeches Thucydides has secured to his narrative the
            character of the highest impartiality. He does not indeed occupy the position of an
            indifferent spectator of events and their results; we are everywhere conscious how
            completely he is an Athenian in sentiment, and how deeply he <pb n="44"/> sympathizes
            with the fortunes of Athens, though he never gives expression to this feeling; he
            belongs indeed by birth and by social position to the aristocratical party, but looks
            for welfare only in a well-tempered form of government, and is always inclined to those
            statesmen who unite force of character with good sense and moderation. This sentiment
            appears in definite expressions as well as by many other indications<note anchored="yes" n="71">Disparaging assertions of the fickleness of the mob and the influence of
              demagogues are found in ii. 21. &sect; 2, 3; 59. &sect; 1, 2; 65. &sect;
              10 ff.; iii. 36. &sect; 4; iv. 28. &sect; 5; vi. 63. &sect; 2. We find the
              most decisive praise of a mixed constitution in viii. 97. &sect; 2.</note>; but
            Thucydides always concedes to those entertaining views opposed to his own the right of
            expressing their reasons; and in the conviction that in human affairs error is always
            associated with truth, that in political matters absolute right and truth are never
            wholly on one side, he presents speech and counter-speech with equally clear and careful
            elaboration. At the very beginning the speeches of the Corcyraeans (i. 32-36) and the
            Corinthians (i. 37-43) give us an insight into a conflict which from the irritation of
            the parties no longer admits a peaceable settlement; and the opposition appears with yet
            greater intensity in the speeches made at Sparta by the Corinthians (i. 68-71) and the
            Athenians (i. 73-78). At Sparta too the peace party and the war party find their living
            utterance in the speeches of Archidamus (i. 80-85) and Sthenela&iuml;das (i. 86);
            but it is felt that passion has now the better of moderation. With excellent effect,
            therefore, the pre-eminent position of Pericles is set before us. He proves
            incontestably (i. 140-144) the necessity of the war from a consideration of the dignity
            and power of Athens, and in a short review (ii. 13) sets forth the sufficiency of her
            means; and when the beginning of the war does not answer their expectations, he is able
            in his incomparable funeral oration (ii. 35-46) to keep his fellow-citizens up to the
            fulness of resolve by the stimulation of a noble and justifiable self-respect; and when
            undeserved misfortune has bowed their spirit and confidence, in his farewell speech (ii.
            60-64) he raises their courage again by calling to mind all the greatness of the past
            and the present. Not less clearly do we become acquainted with <pb n="45"/> the way in
            which other leading men thought and acted, from their speeches whether longer or
            shorter; e.g. Phormio, ii. 89; Demosthenes, iv. 10; Brasidas, iv. 85-87, of whom it is
            said, <foreign lang="greek">ἦν δὲ οὐδὲ ἀδύνατος, ὡς Λακεδαιμόνιος,
            εἰπεῖν</foreign>; Hippocrates, iv. 95; Hermocrates, iv. 59-64; Nicias, vi. 68; vii.
            61-64; 77; Gylippus, vii. 66-68; Alcibiades in Sparta, vi. 89-92. But the art of
            Thucydides in setting forth with objective clearness the reasons <hi rend="italic">pro</hi> and <hi rend="italic">con</hi> of controverted questions is shown most
            conspicuously in the speeches of Cleon and Diodotus, iii. 37-40; 42-48, on the Lesbian
            affair; of the Plataean and Theban deputies, iii. 53-59; 61-67, on the Plataean
            question; of Nicias and Alcibiades, vi. 9-14; 16-18; 20-23, on the Sicilian expedition;
            of Hermocrates and Athenagoras, vi. 33-34; 36-40, on the defence of Syracuse; of
            Hermocrates and the Athenian ambassador Euphemus, vi. 76-80; 82-87, on the accession of
            Camarina. Without our own choice we find ourselves involved in the conflict of
            interests, and are put in a position to form judgment for ourselves from the situation
            of affairs and the feeling of parties. Very seldom does the historian himself add a word
            of comment. The most remarkable instance of his doing so is found in the declarations
            which he makes with regard to the transactions in which Cleon takes part; in iii. 36.
            &sect; 6, on the decision about the Lesbians; and in iv. 21. &sect; 3; 22.
            &sect; 2; 28. &sect; 3 ff.; 39. &sect; 3, about Pylos and the consequent
            proposals of peace made by the Lacedaemonians. The strong aversion which Thucydides
            manifests when he describes the person and actions of Cleon has been attributed in
            ancient as well as in modern times to the personal reason that Cleon was probably the
            cause of the banishment of the historian (see above, p. 11); and this is regarded as a
            violation of historical impartiality. Grote expresses this opinion most decidedly.<note anchored="yes" n="72">
              <title>Hist. of Greece</title>, VI. chap. 53, p. 191 (1870). See above, note
            23.</note> But the assumption of any hostile movement on Cleon's part against Thucydides
            rests only on conjecture,<note anchored="yes" n="73">Niebuhr, <title>Lectures</title>,
              II. p. 82, does not assume it.</note> and appears in fact not necessary to explain the
            unconcealed aversion felt by the historian to Cleon. Thucydides a little more than a
            year after the death of Pericles, who is the object of his love and admiration, says of
            Cleon, <bibl n="Thuc. 3.36.26">iii.36.26</bibl>, <foreign lang="greek">ὢν καὶ ἐς τὰ
              ἄλλα</foreign>
            <pb n="46"/>
            <foreign lang="greek">βιαιότατος τῶν πολιτῶν τῷ τε δήμῳ παρὰ πολὺ ἐν τῷ
              τότε πιθανώτατος</foreign>, and in <bibl n="Thuc. 4.21.9">iv.21.9</bibl>, with
            nearly the same words, <foreign lang="greek">ἀνὴρ δημαγωγὸς κατ’ ἐκεῖνον τὸν
              χρόνον ὢν καὶ τῷ πλήθει πιθανώτατος</foreign>.<note anchored="yes" n="74">Grote, <title>Hist. of Greece</title>, VI. chap. 52, p. 106 (1870), finds this
              repetition so surprising that he thinks Thuc. must have forgotten that he had written
              the former passage. It is more likely that it is nothing more than the expression of
              the lively dislike which Thuc. felt for the predominant influence of Cleon.</note> We
            have in these words only the application to a concrete case of the bitter feeling which
            had already (ii. 65. &sect; 7 ff.) found expression in general terms, where the
            melancholy contrast is drawn out between the <foreign lang="greek">ἔργῳ ὑπὸ τοῦ
              πρώτου ἀνδρὸς ἀρχή</foreign> and the ruinous conduct of those who <foreign lang="greek">ὀρεγόμενοι τοῦ πρῶτος ἕκαστος γίγνεσθαι ἐτράποντο καθ’ ἡδονὰς
              τῷ δήμῳ καὶ τὰ πράγματα ἐνδιδόναι</foreign>. Those judgments about Cleon,
            whose nature had not a trace of the exalted magnanimity of Pericles, are the legitimate
            expression of the historian's profound sorrow at the decline of his country, which he
            saw, after being controlled so gloriously by Pericles, surrendered to the selfseeking
            ambition of unworthy men. He points thus prominently at Cleon because there can be no
            doubt that before the Lesbian affair&mdash;he was even then <foreign lang="greek">τῷ δήμῳ πιθανώτατος</foreign>&mdash;he had attained great influence with the
            mob and had probably embittered the last years of Pericles. If from the speeches in
            Thucydides the same picture of various personalities presents itself to us as the
            historian had formed in his own mind, the highest aim is reached which any historian can
            attain. Genuine impartiality does not exclude judgment and personal conviction in regard
            either to the wisdom or the moral value of purposes and actions. But it is necessary
            that we should be furnished with the materials for forming our own opinions
            independently of the previous judgment of the writer. Thucydides has done this for us to
            an extent and in a manner which probably no other historian has equalled; and in this
            lies his imperishable value for all time.</p>
          <p>In close correspondence with the effort the historian is evidently always making to get
            as close as possible to men and things in their real relations, is his expression in
            language, which he has, we may say, moulded to suit his great task. To form a just
            appreciation of its peculiarities we must consider first of all that Thucydides was <pb n="47"/> the first to employ the Attic speech for the purposes of historical
            narrative. It may be said in general that Attic prose as a written language was then in
            the first stage of its development. It cannot, it is true, be doubted that in the period
            from Solon to Pericles with its momentous political changes the Attic speech had in the
            manifold needs of public and private life formed itself to that character of simplicity,
            clearness, and definiteness by which it is distinguished above all the other Greek
            dialects. It must have been employed in the literary efforts of the Pisistratidae for
            many sorts of records; and it is still more certain that after the restoration of
            freedom the living word of the great statesmen from Clisthenes to Cimon must have
            exerted the most potent influence on the cultivation and settlement of the language. But
            this is again in its kind a phenomenon without parallel in history, that a people so
            rarely dowered as the Greek could live through a long period, crowded with the highest
            human interest and calling into play all forms of political and intellectual activity,
            without leaving any evidences of its existence except in artistic form. While the

          <p>We cannot decide how much of speeches delivered in the assembly or the courts at an
            earlier time was either previously or subsequently noted down; in any case the language
            retained probably longer than any other its character of originality and its capacity of
            receiving new refinements. It still possessed this union of ripeness and power of fresh
            development when the first orators, who paid regard to the theory of their art, and
            Thucydides made use of it. It has been stated above, p. 7 ff., that Thucydides had
            consciously allowed himself to be influenced by the recent elements of culture, which
            had been introduced in his youth by philosophers and rhetoricians, and employed by
            orators like Antiphon; and it is interesting to observe here and there indications of
            this influence;<note anchored="yes" n="76">See above, notes 18 to 21. Poppo, <title>De
                historia Thucydidea commentatio</title>, p. 64.</note> but it is the chief charm of
            the language of the his<pb n="48"/> torian that he used it as a master for the freest
            expression of his personal judgment. There is no trace in his style of blind following
            of worn-out tradition or of phrases made to a pattern.<note anchored="yes" n="77">It is
              no contradiction of this that Thuc. repeats with more or less variation expressions of
              his own coinage; showing rather a certain satisfaction in the successful presentation
              of a thought, than any mere mannerism of language. Such are to be seen in <bibl n="Thuc. 2.8.17">ii.8.17</bibl>; <bibl n="Thuc. 4.14.14">iv.14.14</bibl>: 2. 36. 14;

            </note> Whatever his mind at the moment concentrated itself upon, finds a corresponding
            expression in his words. Accordingly the fundamental character of the language of
            Thucydides is the greatest simplicity and naturalness. Everything in it that occasions
            trouble to the understanding of the reader is due to the effort of the writer to give to
            the expression the most exact correspondence with the matters to be represented. The
            solution of the difficulty, therefore, is to be found by penetrating into the connexion
            of fact and thought; the more we are able to do this, the better shall we succeed in
            getting at the true sense of the words.</p>
          <p>The free position which Thucydides occupies in regard to the still unsettled language
            is seen as well in the choice of particular words as in the order in which they are
            placed. We find in him a considerable number of expressions which occur only in later
            imitators; but we must not attribute to him on this account a conscious seeking after
            what is unusual or antiquated.<note anchored="yes" n="78">This is the charge of Dionys.

            all-sufficient for every need of expression, but understands how to employ new forms
            according to the necessities of his thought. Thucydides may rightly claim the <foreign lang="greek">ποιητικὸν τῶν ὀνομάτων</foreign> and the <foreign lang="greek">πολυειδὲς τῶν σχημάτων</foreign> which Dionysius (24. 6) attributes to him; but he
            is far from abusing in an arbitrary and capricious way the right of innovation which a

            examination will, in all cases, make manifest their fitness for use in their several
            places. In proof of this attention may be called to two of the usages which are of
            especially frequent occurrence. He uses probably oftener than any other writer the
            neuter singular of adjectives and participles as abstract substantives; e.g. <foreign lang="greek">τὸ πιστόν, τὸ βραδύ, τὸ τολμηρόν, τὸ ἐπιεικές, τὸ ξυνετόν, τὸ

            mannerism; but he is striving to clothe the abstract idea in a dress which may render it
            in the particular case more easy of apprehension, while at the same time the neuter
            secures the maintenance of that indefiniteness which pertains to the notion itself. To a
            similar effort to elevate general conceptions as far as possible to distinct
            apprehension is due his tendency to employ verbal nouns in <foreign lang="greek">-της</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">-σις</foreign>. Examples of the former occur
            in <bibl n="Thuc. 1.70.10">i.70.10</bibl>; 138. 14; of the latter, <bibl n="Thuc. 1.141.6">i.141.6</bibl>; <bibl n="Thuc. 3.82.20">iii.82.20</bibl>-30.

            employment of nominal forms instead of verbal ones to an effort to give to the

            of the corresponding verbs.</p>
          <p>The position of words is of yet more importance in the style of Thucydides. It is a law
            of the Greek language that the order of internal importance shall as far as possible be
            manifested in the order of external position; not indeed that the external arrange<pb n="50"/> ment defines the importance of the words; but the oral utterance obeys its
            own special laws, and natural feeling permits these to be treated with freedom. Here
            much must be left to the observation of the reader; but a few observations of
            far-reaching application may be offered. (1) Thucydides is fond of placing at the
            beginning of a sentence the principal object in the accusative, giving thus as it were
            in a single word the theme of the discussion. In these cases the grammatical connexion
            is often relaxed and sometimes wholly abandoned. Cf. <bibl n="Thuc. 1.32.18">i.32.18</bibl>, and the examples there cited. Similarly portions of the predicate are
            placed before the conjunction which introduces the sentence. Cf. <bibl n="Thuc. 1.19.3">i.19.3</bibl>; 77. 6; <bibl n="Thuc. 2.65.7">ii.65.7</bibl>. (2) A general predicate
            noun is placed first in connexion with a following superlative, as noted on <bibl n="Thuc. 1.1.8">i.1.8</bibl>; by this arrangement the noun becomes as it were the text
            of the following remark. (3) Of a different kind are the numerous cases in which a noun
            without the article is placed before a qualifying participle or adjective with the
            article; for this throws the principal stress on the qualifying word; for examples see
            on <bibl n="Thuc. 1.1.6">i.1.6</bibl>. This order is frequent also in Herodotus, but
            comparatively rare in other Attic writers. (4) Partitive genitives, as representing the
            principal notion, generally stand before the governing nouns, particularly in
            designations of places, when the name of the country usually precedes that of a portion
            of it. See on <bibl n="Thuc. 1.100.15">i.100.15</bibl>. So the objective genitive stands
            between a preposition and the noun on which it depends. See on <bibl n="Thuc. 1.32.8">i.32.8</bibl>. (5) Two clauses closely related and connected by a copula
            &mdash;as two objects of the same verb, two verbs with the same object, two
            predicates&mdash;are often separated by another word of importance. This is not
            peculiar to Thucydides but is a favourite arrangement with him. The effect of it is not
            to dislocate the structure, but the interposed obstruction forces into notice the
            essential connexion of the separated clauses. Examples of this occur on nearly every
            page; as in <bibl n="Thuc. 1.69.4">i.69.4</bibl> (<foreign lang="greek">ἐλευθερίας</foreign>), 17 (<foreign lang="greek">τινα</foreign>), 18 (<foreign lang="greek">τὴν αὔξησιν</foreign>). (6) Conversely a parallelism in structure
            occasionally is found where there is no exact correspondence in thought. Cf. <bibl n="Thuc. 1.33.12">i.33.12</bibl>; 69. 32; 138. 18; <bibl n="Thuc. 2.61.19">ii.61.19</bibl>; 74. 16. (7) Great weight is sometimes laid upon an adverbial
            expression by its position at the close of the sentence, an arrangement often used by
            Demosthenes. Cf. <bibl n="Thuc. 1.28.12">i.28.12</bibl>; 77. 19; 133. 8; <bibl n="Thuc. 2.7.18">ii.7.18</bibl>. <pb n="51"/>
          </p>
          <p>Thucydides has made large use of the period with its complete structure of protasis,
            apodosis, and subordinate clauses. But in the simple narrative he prefers to allow the
            circumstances of an event to follow one another in co&ouml;rdination. We often find,
            accordingly, a long series of short sentences, united together by various connective
            particles, which everywhere demand attentive consideration, and none of them to a
            greater degree than the apparently insignificant <foreign lang="greek">τε</foreign>, the
            effect of which has often been pointed out in the commentary. By a paratactic
            arrangement of sentences he often produces a greater effect than we should have
            expected. See on <bibl n="Thuc. 1.26.16">i.26.16</bibl>,<note anchored="yes" n="81">Ullrich, <hi rend="italic">Beitr&auml;ge zur Erkl&auml;rung und Kritik des
                Thucydides</hi>, 1862, p. 34 ff. gives substantially the same account of this
              passage, and shows that the unusual <foreign lang="greek">ἀλλά</foreign> instead of
                <foreign lang="greek">καί</foreign>, depending on the preceding negative, suggests
              really an aposiopesis, as if it were: <foreign lang="greek">ἀλλ’ [ἀπράκτους
                ἀπέπεμψαν καὶ] στρατεύουσιν . . . οἱ Κερκυραῖοι</foreign>.</note> and the
            examples there cited. We may notice also that it is taken for granted that attention to
            the course of the narrative when it is clearly stated will suffice to prevent confusion,
            when, without special notice, the subject is changed, as is more frequently done than is
            usual with us; and even within the limits of the same sentence the extension of the
            subject is enlarged or narrowed, when the circumstances introduced require such a
            modification, so that at the end the same term is to be taken in a wider or a more
            restricted sense than it was at the beginning. See on <bibl n="Thuc. 1.18.21">i.18.21</bibl>; 61. 9; 124. 7; <bibl n="Thuc. 2.54.4">ii.54.4</bibl>; <bibl n="Thuc. 3.23.1">iii.23.1</bibl>; 53. 17; <bibl n="Thuc. 4.6.3">iv.6.3</bibl>; <hi rend="italic">etc.</hi>
          </p>
          <p>The transition from the paratactic arrangement to the period proper is found in the
            annexing of an explanatory member with <foreign lang="greek">γάρ</foreign> at the
            beginning of a long sentence. This is not indeed so frequent as it is in Homer (see
            Classen, <hi rend="italic">Beobachtungen &uuml;ber den homerischen
            Sprachgebrauch</hi>, p. 6 ff.) and in Herodotus, but is found often enough in Thucydides
            (see on <bibl n="Thuc. 1.31.7">i.31.7</bibl>); and the examples noted on <bibl n="Thuc. 1.72.1">i.72.1</bibl>; 115. 14 show how closely this arrangement approximated
            to the actual period. It is in such passages that we best apprehend the effort of the
            writer to give complete expression to his thought by means of a vehicle not yet reduced
            to entire flexibility. Thucydides shares with all energetic <pb n="52"/> thinkers the
            desire to use no superfluous words. It is not surprising, therefore, that we cannot
            without trouble penetrate through the condensed phrase to the full apprehension of his
            meaning, especially in those cases where the most hidden processes of thought and
            feeling are to be indicated. It cannot be asserted that Thucydides aims at brevity and
            finds pleasure in dark expressions. The truth is that in the department in which he
            laboured the Greek language had little or nothing previously worked out, and that he had
            often to wrestle painfully with a resisting material to find satisfactory expression for
            what he desired to say. The evidence of this laborious effort is to be seen in many
            inequalities in the work. Still, where the text is not certainly corrupt, honest and
            resolute effort will always succeed in grasping the true sense of the writer even in the
            most difficult passages.<note anchored="yes" n="82">This may certainly be claimed for
              the results of modern investigation, though Cicero (<title>Orat.</title> 9. 30) could
              aver: <hi rend="italic">ipsae illae contiones ita multas habent obscuras abditasque
                sententias, vix ut intelligantur.</hi>
            </note> The task of understanding Thucydides in all his parts and all his peculiarities
            is, it is true, no light one, but it well repays the effort. It bestows in
            pre&euml;minent degree the satisfactory feeling of sharing the labour of thought
            with a profound and noble intellect. We can observe how in particular cases the thought
            of the writer has even in the very moulding of his sentence taken a direction different
            from that he started with, and thus has shifted into inconsistency of expression. See on
              <bibl n="Thuc. 1.4.7">i.4.7</bibl>; 18. 18; 23. 11; 38. 11; 40. 8; 69. 33; 70. 18; 72.
            9; <hi rend="italic">etc.</hi> It is this occasional divergence from the customary rule
            that creates the greatest difficulty in following the course of the thought of the
            writer with intelligence and sympathetic appreciation.<note anchored="yes" n="83">Dionysius goes to work in just the opposite way in his criticism of Thucydides. Far
              from submitting modestly to the guidance of the author, he applies the rule of his cut
              and dried rhetoric to every passage which does not at once satisfy him, and strives to
              measure all the inequalities of a form of expression which is crammed with thought by
              the standard of a plain common sense which is utterly devoid of character. See
              especially his discussion of iii. 82, 83 in 28-33 of the <title>De Thuc. iud.</title>
            </note>
          </p>
          <p>As we could reach no certainty with regard to the end of the life of Thucydides, so the
            early history of the work he left must remain in darkness. Modern scholars are at
            variance even as to the form <pb n="53"/> in which the eighth book was left. Some regard
            the absence of speeches as a proof that its author had not given it its final form:
            others find this fact sufficiently explained by the character of the events recorded in
            it. The latter view is probably correct:<note anchored="yes" n="84">See note 70.</note>
            yet there are many points of style and matter which seem to indicate that the book did
            not receive the last revision of the author, particularly the fact that it breaks off in
            the midst of a narrative uncompleted. This, combined with the divergent statements as to
            the manner and place of the death of the writer, gave occasion even in antiquity to
            various conjectures, which are recorded by Marcellinus, &sect; 43, 44; as that a
            daughter of Thucydides wrote the book, or Theopompus, or Xenophon. There is no
            probability internal or external for any one of these. There may be so much truth as
            this: that the daughter of Thucydides, after her father's sudden death by an attack of
            robbers, saved his unfinished work from destruction, and gave it for publication to some
            person who by his interest or personal position was fitted for the task. The names of
            Theopompus and Xenophon are evidently mentioned only because each of them was known to
            have continued the history of Thucydides. Theopompus, indeed, could have been hardly
            born at the time of the death of Thucydides. As to Xenophon, we read in Diog. Laert.
              <bibl n="Thuc. 2.6.57">ii.6.57</bibl>, <foreign lang="greek">λέγεται ὅτι καὶ τὰ

            Thucydides when he might have suppressed them, may suggest that they were intrusted to

            has done this when, assuming that Xenophon could have published the history of
            Thucydides only before his own expedition to Asia in 400, he fancies that he has thus
            secured a fixed limit for the life of Thucydides. Certainty on these points cannot be
            attained even by the most acute combination.</p>
          <p>The division of the work into eight books is founded upon a just consideration of the
            facts. The first book contains the introduc<pb n="54"/> tion proper and all preliminary
            notices; the second, third, and fourth contain the first nine years of the Archidamian
            war, three in each; the fifth, the concluding year of the same with the intermediate
            period of <foreign lang="greek">εἰρήνη ὕπουλος</foreign>; the sixth and seventh, the
            Sicilian expedition from its hopeful beginning to its disastrous close; the eighth, all
            that follows this in the Decelean and Ionian wars, so far as the history extends. This
            division, however, was probably not made by Thucydides himself; for, if it had been, it
            is not likely that any others would have obtained currency, which Marcellinus,
            &sect; 58, asserts to have been the case, one division being into thirteen books. It
            was probably introduced, like similar divisions of other works, in Alexandria, and
            maintained itself in use from that time on, since Dionysius and other grammarians
            commonly make use of it. Dionysius is wont also to define particular portions of the
            work by the number of their lines or <foreign lang="greek">στίχοι</foreign>. For
            example, the first 87 chapters amount to 2000 <foreign lang="greek">στίχοι</foreign>
              (<title>De Thuc. iud.</title> 10. 5); the proem alone, i. 1-23, to 500 (<hi rend="italic">ibid.</hi> 19. 1); the reflexions on the Corcyraean sedition, iii. 82,

            to compile the history of the war with the full anticipation at the very beginning that
            it would prove extraordinarily important. To express merely that Thuc. was the author,

            This position of the subst. gives it a character of generality, with nearly the effect

            regarded merely as a preparation for the Peloponnesian war, c. 18, 19. In c. 20-22 Thuc.
            contrasts his own method with that of the poets and logographers who have narrated

            <foreign lang="greek"/>: the popular belief which Thuc. opposes here, and more fully in

            of Harmodius and Aristogeiton. Hdt. v. 55; vi. 123 agrees with Thuc. The principal
            stress lies on <foreign lang="greek">τύραννον ὄντα</foreign>, just as in 7 <foreign lang="greek">πρεσβύτατος ὤν</foreign> gives the reason for <foreign lang="greek">ἦρχε</foreign>. So in 9, <foreign lang="greek">ὑποτοπήσαντες</foreign> stands at

            in view. Cobet, Mnem. 12, p. 158, explains that Hdt. means that the <hi rend="italic">one</hi> nearest kinsman of the kings cast two votes for the kings, if both absent,
            and a third for himself, and that the pl. <foreign lang="greek">τοὺς μάλιστα

            <foreign lang="greek"/>: since Thuc. has in view the expedition of Xerxes (<foreign lang="greek">ὁ μέγας στόλος</foreign> of c. 18. 14), the Schol. is probably right

            of c. 76. St.'s is probably the correct interpretation of this passage, adopted in the

            force of the two partics. (2) <foreign lang="greek">ταῖς . . . δίκαις</foreign> refers
            to what are commonly called <foreign lang="greek">δίκαι ἀπὸ ξυμβόλων</foreign>, i.e.
            commercial treaties originally made between independent states, in accordance with which
            disputes in matters of trade <pb n="188"/> (ex contractu) were decided upon certain
            fixed rules in the courts of the defendant's city. As Athens had no doubt such treaties
            with many of her allies before their subjection to tribute, there is no reason to
            suppose they were abrogated after that change in their political status. (3) <foreign lang="greek">τὰς κρίσεις</foreign> refers to the compulsory jurisdiction which
            Athens enforced upon her allies in her own courts in suits arising ex delicto between
            Athenians and citizens of subject states, and also between citizens of subject states by
            way of appeal, when the sentence in the local court was either death, exile, or
            disfranchisement. Probably it soon came to pass that the more important of such cases
            were brought to Athenian courts in the first instance. (4) <foreign lang="greek">αὐτοῖς</foreign> does not agree with <foreign lang="greek">ἡμῖν</foreign> but
            means <hi rend="italic">for them, i.e.</hi> for the allies. The passage may be thus
            paraphrased: &ldquo;For even though we exact less than our power would justify in
            cases decided under commercial treaties made with our allies, and though we have
            established for them trials in our own courts on the basis of impartial laws for us and
            them, we are thought to be litigious.&rdquo; Cf. Dem. LVI. 14, <foreign lang="greek">ἡγούμενοι δεῖν ἐλαττοῦσθαι τι καὶ συγχωρεῖν ὥστε μὴ δοκεῖν φιλόδικοι
