<p>THE opening sentence embodies the title in the work. Cf. the
opening words of Hecataeus (fr. 332) <foreign lang="greek">Ἑ. Μιλήσιος ὧδε μυθεῖται</foreign> and
<bibl n="Thuc. 1.1">Thuc. i. 1</bibl>. <foreign lang="greek">Θουρίου</foreign> (<foreign rend="ital">vid.</foreign> app. crit.) seems to have been the usual
reading at the end of the fourth century (cf. Duris of Samos, fr. 57,
F. H. G. ii. 482). Plutarch (Mor. 605) writes <foreign lang="greek">Ἡ. Ἁλικαρνασσέως
ἱστορίης ἀπόδειξις ἥδε· πολλοί μεταγράφουσιν Ἡροδότου Θουρίου,
μετῴκησε γὰρ εἰς Θουρίους</foreign>, which seems to be intended to reconcile
the two traditions. The Alexandrine librarians, however, must
have had good reasons for restoring <foreign lang="greek">Ἁλικ</foreign>. in the text. (For H.'s
birth, &amp;c., cf. Introd. &sect;&sect; 1-2.)</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ἱστορίης</lemma>: properly &lsquo;inquiry&rsquo;, and so the &lsquo;result of inquiry&rsquo; (ii. 99.
1); only once in H.=&lsquo;history&rsquo; (vii. 96. 1) in the modern sense. Croiset
(Litt. Grec. ii. 589) well says that the word &lsquo;marks a literary revolution&rsquo;; 
the <foreign lang="greek">λογογράφοι</foreign> had written down the current stories, the
historian sets out to &lsquo;find&rsquo; the truth.</p>
<p>The reason given for writing is characteristic of H.; he is the
born chronicler, and his interest is in the past: Thucydides (i. 22.
4) is the scientific historian, and his eye is on the future&mdash;<foreign lang="greek">τῶν
γενομένων τὸ σαφὲς σκοπεῖν καὶ τῶν μελλόντων ποτὲ αὖθις κατὰ τὸ
ἀνθρώπινον τοιούτων καὶ παραπλησίων ἔσεσθαι</foreign>.</p>
<p>The <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ἔργα</lemma> are the permanent results, &lsquo;monuments&rsquo;, &amp;c.</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">τά τε ἄλλα</lemma> is in loose apposition to <foreign lang="greek">τὰ γενόμενα</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">ἔργα</foreign>.</p></div>

<div3 id="c.1.1.1" type="section" n="1">
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">οἱ λόγιοι</lemma> (= &lsquo;skilled in history&rsquo;) cf. ii. 3. 1. H.'s story is
decidedly Greek, and not Persian, in colouring: cf. vi. 54; vii. 150.
2 for a like (supposed) Persian acquaintance with Greek myths; a
similar knowledge is attributed to the Egyptians ii. 91. 5. Such
combinations certainly come from Greek sources, not native ones.</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">Φοίνικας</lemma>. The name (whence Lat. &lsquo;Poenus&rsquo;) seems to be pure
Greek; it certainly occurs in places where there is no trace of
foreign influence; e. g. the harbour <foreign lang="greek">Φοινικοῦς</foreign>, near Erythrae (<bibl n="Thuc. 8.34">Thuc.
viii. 34</bibl>), a stream near Thermopylae, &amp;c. (Meyer, ii. 92). As
applied to a race, it may well be a colour name, &lsquo;Red men&rsquo;; cf.
<foreign lang="greek">Αἰθίοψ</foreign> and &lsquo;White Syrians&rsquo; (6. 1 n.). This derivation, however, is not
inconsistent with it being also a foreign name. The old connexion
with &lsquo;Fenchu&rsquo;, supposed to occur at Karnak in the inscriptions of
Thothmes III, is now given up; others see in the name the
Egyptian &lsquo;Punt&rsquo;, the land of South Arabia and East Africa. This
last is the view of E. Gl&auml;ser, Punt und die S&uuml;darabischen Reiche
<pb n="54"/>
(1899), who holds that from this &lsquo;original home&rsquo; (p. 62) the Phoenicians 
spread both north (<foreign rend="ital">v. i.</foreign>) and south to Mashonaland and
Socotra; he says (p. 65) the gods of Phoenicia can be almost all
easily recognized as South Arabian. This derivation would agree
with the legend of their migration from the shores of the Indian
Ocean (vii. 89. 2), which first occurs here; for a later version cf.
Strabo, 766 (based on Androsthenes, a seaman of Alexander), who
says that the islands of Tyros (<foreign rend="ital">v. l.</foreign> Tylos) and Arados (<foreign rend="ital">hod.</foreign>
Bahrein) in the Persian Gulf claimed to be the mother cities of the
Phoenician towns; he elsewhere (35) rejects the story. Justin (xviii. 3)
actually professes to give their route when migrating: for a discussion
of these passages cf. Maspero, ii. 63 seq., who accepts the general fact
of the migration from the south-east, and dates it soon after 3000 B. C.,
on the evidence of ii. 44. 3. General probability confirms this northwest 
movement of the Semitic peoples, though Meyer (i. 356)
rejects the whole story. The position of the Phoenicians, wedged
in on the narrow strip of coast, shows they were the earliest among
the Semitic migrants (cf. the position of the Celtic peoples in
Wales, Brittany, &amp;c.). But beyond this all is uncertain.</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">Ἐρυθρῆς θαλάσσης</lemma> (cf. ii. 8. 1 <foreign rend="ital">et pass.</foreign>). H. means by this all the
water south-east and south of Asia; our &lsquo;Red Sea&rsquo; was its western
limit, and has the special name of <foreign lang="greek">Ἀράβιος κόλπος</foreign> (ii. 102. 2 <foreign rend="ital">et
pass.</foreign>); beyond it to the south-west lay <foreign lang="greek">ἡ νοτίη θάλασσα</foreign> (iv. 42. 3);
the Persian Gulf proper has no special name in H. (cf. i. 180. 1, where
the Euphrates runs into the <foreign lang="greek">Ἑρυθρὴ θάλασσα</foreign>). The name &lsquo;Red
Sea&rsquo; is Egyptian, and is derived perhaps from the colour of the
sand.</p></div3>
<div3 id="c.1.1.2" type="section" n="2">
<p>The pre-eminence of Argos in early times is an inference from
Homer, and even more from the Cyclic poems, e.g. the Thebais
and the Epigoni (cf. <ref target="c.5.67" targOrder="U">v. 67 n.</ref>). Hellas did not obtain its name till
after the Dorian invasion (cf. i. 58 nn.).</p>

<p>That Io was the daughter of Inachus was the usual form of
the legend (cf. <bibl n="Apollod. 2.1.3">Apollod. ii. 1. 3</bibl>; F. H. G. i. 125; who gives two
other forms). The cow-headed 10 of Argos is another form of
Hera (cf. Homeric epithet <foreign lang="greek">βοῶπις</foreign>; but see Farnell G. C. i. 16), and
represents the cow-goddess of an early race; this animal-worship
was not understood, and so was explained by a myth. Io, whose
descendant, Danaus, migrates from Egypt to Argos, was identified
with Isis; the identification was probably due in part to similarity
of name, in part to the resemblance of the horned maiden, Io, to
Hathor-Isis (see ii. 41. 1 n.). This identification may be subsequent
to the foundation of Naucratis, but more probably belongs to
Mycenaean times. H. rationalizes the old myths into plain matter
of fact (cf. ii. 56-7 for the similar treatment of the myth of
Dodona and Intr. &sect; 26).

<p>The usual Greek myth (not in H.) was that Io was turned into
a heifer, and wandered till she came to Egypt, where she bore
Epaphus (Apis; cf. <ref target="c.2.38.1" targOrder="U">ii. 38. 1 n.</ref>).</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">βασιλέος</lemma>. Homer calls him &lsquo;Phoenix&rsquo; (<bibl n="Hom. Il. 14.321">Il. xiv. 321</bibl>), but H. gives
the usual form &lsquo;Agenor&rsquo; (iv. 147. 4; in vi. 47. 1 we must translate
<foreign lang="greek">Θάσου τοῦ Φοίνικος</foreign> &lsquo;Thasus the Phoenician&rsquo;).</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">Κρῆτες</lemma>. This is H.'s own suggestion; the usual form of the
legend was that Europa bore Minos and Rhadamanthus to Zeus
in Crete; he means that, if this were properly interpreted, it
would agree with the Persian version here told; &lsquo;these would then
be Cretans.&rsquo; The words <foreign lang="greek">ταῦτα μὲν κτλ</foreign>. imply that the balance of
criminality now was equal; hence the Greeks were really to blame
for the next act of aggression.</p></div3>

this part of his history gave offence. It was parodied by Aristophanes 
(Achar. 524 seq. <foreign lang="greek">ἐκ τριῶν λαικαστριῶν</foreign>), as to the origin of
the Peloponnesian War; and &lsquo;Plutarch&rsquo; (de Malig. 11) is very
angry at the &lsquo;passive resistance&rsquo; imputed to the much-respected
Io, and that &lsquo;the fairest and greatest exploit of Greece, the Trojan
War, should be put down as <foreign lang="greek">ἀβελτερία</foreign>&rsquo; (&lsquo;fatuity&rsquo;). For other
parodies of H. cf. <bibl n="Aristoph. Ach. 82-6">Achar. 82-6</bibl> with <bibl n="Hdt. 1.133.1">133. 1</bibl> and <bibl n="Hdt. 1.192.1">192. 1</bibl>; <bibl n="Aristoph. Birds 552">Av.

<p>H.'s religious feeling shows itself at once; he desires not only to
record men's &lsquo;great deeds&rsquo;, but to show the instability of human
fortune (cf. c. 32 nn.). The idea was a commonplace with the
Ionian philosophers, e.g. Xenophanes <foreign lang="greek">ἀεὶ δ’ ἐν ταὐτῷ μίμνει κινούμενον
οὐδέν</foreign> (R. and P. p. 84), and with the Greeks generally, e. g. <bibl n="Soph. Trach. 132">Soph.

<p>H. ignores the upper course of the Halys, where it flows from
north-east to south-west; it was its lower course which formed the
boundary of the Lydian Empire; cf. c. 72 for a fuller account
of it.
<pb n="56"/></p>
<p>By &lsquo;Syrians&rsquo; H. means the North Cappadocians (i. 72. 1), called
by Strabo (542, 737) also &lsquo;the White Syrians&rsquo;, in contrast to the
darker Syrians of the Levant. Some have distinguished <foreign lang="greek">Σύριοι</foreign>
(= &lsquo;Cappadocians&rsquo;) from <foreign lang="greek">Σύροι</foreign> (= &lsquo;the inhabitants of Palestine&rsquo;),
but the variety of spelling seems due merely to copyists. The
name is probably a corruption of &lsquo;Assyrian&rsquo;; H. (vii. 63) actually
uses it of the Assyrians, and says &lsquo;Syrian&rsquo; is the Greek, &lsquo;Assyrian&rsquo;
the barbarous form. When the Greeks came in contact with the
empire of Assyria in the eighth century, e. g. from Sinope, they
began to use the term of all its subjects; the name first occurs in
Pindar, fr. 173 (in Strabo, 544), the Amazons <foreign lang="greek">Σύριον εὐρυαίχμαν
δίεπον στρατόν</foreign>, which Strabo says refers to the settlement at
Themiscyra near Amisus.</p></div3>

<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">πρῶτος</lemma>. H. shows real insight in seeing that, though the complete 
conquest of the Asiatic Greeks by Lydia was brief, it was an
event of first-rate importance, as the &lsquo;beginning&rsquo; of the subjection
of Greeks to barbarians.</p></div3>

<p>Nicolaus Damascenus (F. H. G. iii. 383) calls Candaules &lsquo;Sadyattes&rsquo;. 
Hesychius (<foreign rend="ital">s. v.</foreign> <foreign lang="greek">Κυνάγχη</foreign>) says that <foreign lang="greek">Κανδαύλας</foreign> = Hermes
or Heracles (cf. Hipponax, fr. 1, <foreign lang="greek">Ἑρμῆ κυνάγχα, Μῃονιστὶ κανδαῦλα</foreign>);
in this case &lsquo;C.&rsquo; may be a cult-name, assumed by the king in
addition to his own (cf. the new names taken by Popes).</p>
<p>Hall (J. H. S. xxix. 19) points out that the name <foreign lang="greek">Μυρσίλος</foreign>
(&lsquo;Mursil&rsquo;) has been found by Winckler at Boghaz Keui as that of
a Hittite king. He suggests that the name, which is that of Pelops'
charioteer, tends to confirm the old tradition that Pelops was an
immigrant into Greece, and to show that perhaps in the fourteenth
century B. C., Greece was subject to a Hittite dynasty.</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">Σαρδίων</lemma>. H. almost always follows (cf. <ref target="c.3.120.1" targOrder="U">iii. 120. 1 n.</ref>) the Persian
usage in calling the Lydian satrapy by the name of its capital.</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">Ἀλκαίου</lemma>. H. is the only writer who mentions Alcaeus as the son
of Heracles, though both the grandfather of Heracles and Heracles
himself (<bibl n="Diod. 1.24">Diod. i. 24</bibl>) are sometimes called Alcaeus.</p>
<p>The Greeks identified the Asiatic Bel, in Cilicia (Meyer, i. 484)
and perhaps in Lydia called &lsquo;Sandon&rsquo; (cf. i. 71. 2), with Heracles,
because he was a lion-tamer and a bow-bearer; he was probably a
sun-god, though Meyer (<foreign rend="ital">v. s.</foreign>) makes him a vegetation-god.</p>
<p>H.'s list, then, may be a piece of genuine native tradition with
Graecized names; at the head of it appear two great deities,
Heracles and Omphale, representing the sun-god and Ashtoreth.
But H. is inconsistent in vii. 61, where he makes Perseus, an
ancestor of Heracles, rescue Andromeda, the granddaughter of
Belus. It is more probable, however, that Heracles has no proper
place in the genealogy, and is brought in by a piece of Greek
syncretism, because the <foreign lang="greek">δούλη</foreign> (&sect; 4) was supposed to be Omphale.
The genealogy itself seems hopelessly confused; the (otherwise
<pb n="57"/>
unknown, <foreign rend="ital">v. s.</foreign>) son of a Greek hero is father of a Babylonian god
and grandfather of the eponymous hero of Nineveh.</p>
<p>While, however, the form in which the genealogy is presented is
Greek, it may represent a real tradition of early connexion with the
East. This can hardly have been with the great kingdoms of the
Euphrates valley, for Assurbanipal states that when the ambassadors
of &lsquo;Gugu of Luddi&rsquo; arrived at Nineveh (R. P. i.<hi rend="sup">1</hi> 68), &lsquo;the king's very
fathers had not heard speak of its name&rsquo;; but it may have been
with the Hittite empire in Asia Minor, as was suggested by Sayce
(ad loc.) as long ago as 1883. Hogarth says (I. and E., p. 75): &lsquo;it may
well be that the rock monuments near Smyrna are memorials of a
definite political occupation by the power of the Hatti.&rsquo; Garstang
too (p. 63) is disposed to accept H.'s traditions as having elements
of truth in them.</p>
<p>Ninus was, according to the Greeks (Ctes. Ass. ii, p. 390), the
founder of Nineveh; but his name does not appear on the monuments.</p>
<p>Belus is properly a common name, &lsquo;lord,&rsquo; but became identified
with the chief god of Babylonia (cf. Hastings' D. of B., <foreign rend="ital">s. v.</foreign>
Baal).</p></div3>

then the genealogy may represent the combination of the European
(Cotys) and the Asiatic (Atys) elements (App. I. 4); but all this is
most uncertain.</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">Μηίων</lemma>. For &lsquo;Maeonians&rsquo; cf. App. I. 8. Homer only knows this
name (<bibl n="Hom. Il. 2.864">Il. ii. 864</bibl>; x. 431, &amp;c.); the earliest occurrence of &lsquo;Lydian&rsquo; in
a Greek author is in Xanthus, fr. 1. The identification of Maeonians
with Lydians was not always accepted (Strabo, 572). Assuming its
truth, however, it may be conjectured that the Lydians represent
rather the European element in the people, the Maeonian the Asiatic.
Radet (p. 59) thinks that the statement on the monuments of
Assurbanipal (<foreign rend="ital">u. s.</foreign>) means only that the Luddi were unknown <emph>by
that name</emph>; he therefore connects &lsquo;Lydian&rsquo; with the rise of Gyges;
but this is very doubtful. &lsquo;Maeonian&rsquo; survived as a tribal name
<pb n="58"/>
(vii. 77), and as the name of a city (<bibl n="Plin. Nat. 5.30">Plin. N. H. v. 111</bibl>) and a district
on the upper Hermus (Strabo, 576, 628), including the <foreign lang="greek">Κατακεκαυμένη</foreign>.</p></div3>

<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">δούλης</lemma>. The usual story (<bibl n="Apollod. 2.6.3">Apollod. ii. 6. 3</bibl>) is unknown to H.; it called
Omphale a daughter of Iardanus (whose name may be Semitic, cf.
&lsquo;Jordan&rsquo;), and made Hercules her bought slave. Later writers, especially 
the Roman poets, make him assume women's dress and do
women's work. Meyer (i. 487) considers that this story is based upon
the special Anatolian rites of the great nature-goddess, in which her
worshippers cut themselves in sympathy with her sorrows, and even
unsexed themselves (cf. story of Attis); so, too, maidens sacrificed
their chastity to her (cf. 93. 4; 199 nn.). But if this is the origin of
the myth, it is curious that its special feature, the woman's dress, &amp;c.,
appears only in late versions. It seems better, therefore, to compare
the story of Hercules serving Omphale with that of Apollo serving
Admetus, and to explain both as a sort of atonement by service;
the price of blood shed is worked off in this way.</p>
<p>Whence H. derived the figure 505 is a puzzle. According to some
it is a calculation based on the average length of a reign; if a generation 
was taken at 33 1/3 years (ii. 142. 2), a reign might average 22 1/2.
R. Schubert (K&ouml;n. von Lyd., p. 8) adds the five generations of the
Mermnadae (c. 13) to the 22 here, and allows an average of 25
years per generation, thus getting (27 x 25 =) 675 for the total.
Deductig the 170 years of the Mermnadae, he gets the 505 given to
the Heraclidae (cf. App. XIV. 5). This is plausible, but only one
thing is certain, that the figures have no historic value.</p></div3></div>

Ἠέλιος φαέθων καταδέρκεται ἀκτίνεσσιν</foreign>) lived in perpetual darkness;
cf. our &lsquo;Cimmerian&rsquo;, a use as old as Milton's L'Allegro, &lsquo;In dark
Cimmerian desert ever dwell.&rsquo;</p>
<p>For the Cimmerian invasion in H. cf. also cc. 103, 105-6, and
(especially) iv. 11-12. It is an event of the greatest importance;
the main points as to it may be summarized under four heads.</p>
<p>1. <hi rend="bold">Its course.</hi> The Cimmerians seem to have lived originally in
South Russia (cf. iv. 12. 1 and &lsquo;Crimea&rsquo;): they were expelled thence
by the Scythians, who were fleeing &lsquo;across the Araxes&rsquo; (probably
the Volga) from the Massagetae (iv. 11. 1). This &lsquo;common tradition
of Greeks and barbarians&rsquo; (iv. 12. 3) may well be true; it is in
accordance with all analogy. As to the route, however, which the
Cimmerians took, opinion is much divided. H. is clearly wrong in
his details: (1) he brings the horde along the east coast of the Black
Sea, which is impossible, owing to its precipitous nature; (2) he combines
the original expulsion of the Cimmerians from Europe (end
of eighth century) with the Scythian raids of the last quarter of
the seventh century (c. 103 nn.).</p>
<p>As to the accuracy of his general view, there is much uncertainty.
It used to be maintained (e. g. Meyer, i<hi rend="sup">1</hi>. 452, 463; but he has now
altered his opinion so far as to bring the Cimmerians from the East,
i. 473) that the Cimmerian and the Scythian raids were quite independent 
movements, different in direction and different in date,
which H. or his informants wrongly combined. Some of the most
<pb n="61"/>
modern orientalists, however (Maspero, iii. 342 n.; Pr&aacute;&sbreve;ek, Gesch.
der Med. et Pers., 1906, pp. 113-14), accept H.'s chief point, that
both Cimmerians and Scythians entered Asia Minor from the northeast. 
The Cimmerians settle round L. Van, the Scyths round L. Urumiah; 
then, under Esarhaddon, the Scyths drive the Cimmerians
west into Asia Minor (Pr&aacute;&scaron;ek, p. 120). This view may well be right in
the main; it explains the importance of Sinope as a seat of the
Cimmerians (cf. iv. 12. 2). But it is extremely probable that another
body of Cimmerians was at the same time entering Asia Minor from
the north-west (cf. <ref target="c.4.11.4" targOrder="U">iv. 11. 4 n.</ref>); they held Antandrus for a century
(Arist. in Steph. Byz. <foreign rend="ital">s. v.</foreign>), and they were accompanied (Strabo,
61, 647) by the Treres, a Thracian tribe (<bibl n="Thuc. 2.96.4">Thuc. ii. 96. 4</bibl>). This invasion 
from the north-west may be compared to that of the Gauls
in 278 B. C. (See Note I, p. 454.)</p>
<p>2. <hi rend="bold">Its date.</hi> In the time of Sargon (722-705) we hear of the
Gimirrai and I&sbreve;kuza (&lsquo;Cimmerians and Scyths&rsquo;, Pr&aacute;&scaron;ek, p. 115)
north of the kingdom of Ararat; both Esarhaddon (681-668) and
Assurbanipal (668-626) speak of victories over the Cimmerians. It is
in connexion with them that the Assyrian monuments mention Gyges,
who was on the throne of Lydia when they appeared, and who,
warned by the god Assur in a dream, sought Assyrian aid against
them (R. P. i<hi rend="sup">1</hi>, p. 68). Revolting from Assyria later (cf. <ref target="c.2.152.3" targOrder="U">ii. 152. 3 n.</ref>),
he was killed by them. Sardis was taken about 657; Strabo (627),
quoting Callisthenes, makes it taken twice, which is doubtful. H.
wrongly makes the Cimmerian invasions begin under Ardys; the
reason is that his earlier Lydian kings are antedated. The date
for the Cimmerians in Eusebius&mdash;1078 B. C.&mdash;is explained by the
confusion of them with the Amazons (cf. <bibl n="Diod. 2.44">Diod. ii. 44</bibl>; perhaps we
have a trace of this confusion in <bibl n="Hdt. 4.110">H. iv. 110</bibl>).</p>
<p>3. <hi rend="bold">Its relation to the Greeks.</hi> Magnesia was captured (Archil,
fr. 20), but Ephesus, encouraged by Callinus (fr. 3), successfully
resisted the hordes (Strabo, 647-8) <foreign lang="greek">νῦν δ’ ἐπὶ Κιμμερίων στρατὸς
ἔρχεται ὀβριμοεργῶν</foreign>. H. rightly says it was &lsquo;a plundering raid&rsquo;, not
a conquest (i. 6. 3). In fact, it may be said to have benefited the
Greeks by breaking for a time the Lydian power; so the Mongols
of Timour, by their victory over the Turks at Angora (A. D. 1402),
postponed for half a century the fall of Constantinople.</p>
<p>4. <hi rend="bold">General effects.</hi> Asia as a whole suffered more than the
Greeks. The Bithynians, formerly a European tribe (vii. 75. 2),
now settled in Bithynia; the Phrygian kingdom received a blow
from which it never recovered; the old kingdom of Urartu disappears, 
and the Armenians (and perhaps also the Cappadocians,
Pr&aacute;&sbreve;ek) come on the stage of history. It was an early &lsquo;wandering of
the nations&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Perhaps even more important was the blow to the great Assyrian
Empire. Although its diplomacy made use of the Scyths (c. 103 n.),
<pb n="62"/>
yet the raids of these northern barbarians in the seventh century
were one of the causes of its overthrow.</p>
<p>Of the effect produced by these early &lsquo;Vandals and Huns&rsquo; we
have a clear trace in the contemporary Isaiah (v. 26 seq.) and in
Ezekiel's picture (c. 39), drawn early in the sixth century, of the
army of destruction from the north; by a curious confusion, Gyges,
the victim of the Cimmerians, has become &lsquo;Gog&rsquo;, the &lsquo;prince of
Meshech and Tubal&rsquo;, i. e. of the Moschi and Tibareni, part of the
invading hordes. The best short account of the Cimmerian invasion
is Busolt, ii. 461-4, who does not accept H.'s combination.</p></div>

<p>Arion's date is the end of the seventh century. Meyer (ii. 373)
makes him as mythical as Orpheus or Marsyas, and Crusius (in
P. W. <foreign rend="ital">s. v.</foreign> 840) suggests that his name simply = &lsquo;prizewinner,&rsquo; but
his reality may be admitted, although the only poem attributed to
him (Ael. H. A. xii. 45; Bergk, P. L. iii. 80, describing the miracle)
is a forgery. H. is wrong in attributing the <foreign lang="greek">διθύραμβος</foreign> to him; the

<p>Perhaps Arion elaborated the dithyramb and arranged it antistrophically

χοροί</foreign> is ascribed to him by the older authorities, e. g. Hellanicus
(fr. 85; F. H. G. i. 57; but others assigned them to Lasus (ib.)).
If this be so, the fact underlying H.'s view as to the origin of the
dithyramb at Corinth would be that the choric Dionysus song
developed in north Peloponnese (Crusius in P. W. ii. 841; cf. <ref target="c.5.67" targOrder="U">v. 67 n.</ref>
for such choruses at Sicyon). So Pindar (Olym. xiii. 19) attributes
the dithyramb to Corinth, although the scholiast to this passage
says he attributed it elsewhere to Naxos and to Thebes; all these
places were connected with Dionysus. Its proper subject was

dolphin stories are told, of Hesiod's murdered body, and of Enalus

heard it at Taenarum, in connexion with the Arion monument (&sect; 8),

<p>The order of the words <foreign lang="greek">ἄλλοι τε οἱ</foreign> (not <foreign lang="greek">οἵ τε ἄλλοι</foreign>) shows H. did
not consider Solon a <foreign lang="greek">σοφιστής</foreign>; he uses the word (ii. 49. 1) of the
followers of Melampus and (iv. 95. 2) of Pythagoras. The word
here has, of course, no bad sense, though the causal participle

Laert. i. 1. 40) said that all the Seven Sages except Thales met at
the court of Croesus. H. knows nothing of this fiction.</p>
<p>The truth of his story as to Solon and Croesus was early doubted,
and it is now universally given up, on chronological grounds,
though Plutarch (Sol. 27) declined to surrender a story &lsquo;so famous
and so becoming to the character of Solon&rsquo;, because of <foreign lang="greek">χρονικοί</foreign>
<pb n="67"/>
<foreign lang="greek">τινες λεγόμενοι κανόνες</foreign>. Solon's legislation is put in 594 B. C. (or
perhaps in 591, <foreign lang="greek">Ἀθ. Πολ</foreign>. 14. 1), while Croesus came to the throne in
560 (or later); hence the Athenian's travels belong to the generation 
before Croesus. Of the travels there is no reason to doubt;
they probably were mentioned in Solon's poems (cf. v. 113. 2, the
praise of Philocyprus at Soli). A similar chronological mistake
occurs when H. makes Solon borrow a law from Amasis of Egypt
(cf. 30. 1; ii. 177. 2 n.). Early attempts (e. g. by Clinton) to save
the credit of H. are refuted by Grote (iii. 150-1).</p>
<p>Were the general chronology of H. for the sixth century less
weak (cf. App. XIV. 6), the story of this meeting might be defended
by adopting the later form of the tradition (Diog. Laert. i. 2. 50-1),
that Solon's travels were after the usurpation of Pisistratus, i. e.
after 560; D. L. improves on H. by making Solon say that Croesus
in all his glory was not arrayed like a pheasant and a peacock.
This date is given in a fourth century (?) philosophical dialogue
(Oxyrhynchus Papyri, iv. 72 seq.), which also synchronizes the
tyrannies of Pisistratus and Periander (cf. v. 95 nn.); but this only
proves that H.'s mistakes had gained wide acceptance. It is best
to look upon the tale as a piece of popular philosophy, in which
Croesus and Solon are introduced as illustrations, on ethical and
not on historical grounds.</p>
<p>The fact that H. tells us nothing of the laws of Solon is a good
instance of the danger of the &lsquo;argumentum ex silentio&rsquo;; it is oversubtle 
to suppose, as some have done, that H.'s informants suppressed 
the constitutional work of Solon, in order to exalt the
credit of the Alcmaeonid Cleisthenes as the founder of Athenian
democracy. The explanation of the omission is probably that H.
has no interest in constitutional history.</p>

<p>Other instances in H. beside the story of Croesus are that of
Polycrates and the whole account of Xerxes (iii. 39 seq.). It is one of
the main motives of his history (cf. Intr. pp. 49-50), as being the cause
of the changes of fortune (i. 207. 2) which he has to record. Since
the Greeks conceived their gods in their own likeness, it was natural
that they should make them tyrants; cf. <foreign lang="greek">φιλέει ὁ θεὸς τὰ ὑπερέχοντα
κολούειν</foreign> (vii. 10 <foreign lang="greek">ε</foreign>) with the <foreign lang="greek">τοὺς ὑπερόχους τῶν ἀστῶν φονεύειν</foreign> of the

<p>The name Atys is that of the Phrygio-Lydian deity, Attes or
Attis, clearly connected with the Syrian Ate (whose female double
is Atargatis; cf. Meyer, i. 487): the cult itself is probably of
Hittite origin and is closely connected with that of Adonis
(Thammuz; cf. <ref target="c.2.79.2" targOrder="U">ii. 79. 2 n.</ref>). Frazer (G. B.<hi rend="sup">2</hi> ii. 130-7) describes the
cult, and says that Attis is &lsquo;a deity of vegetation whose divine life
manifested itself in the pine tree and the spring violets&rsquo; (used in his
ritual). According to one form of the legend Attes was killed by
a boar, according to the other form (current in Pessinus) by selfmutilation 
(<bibl n="Paus. 7.17.10">Paus. vii. 17. 10-12</bibl>); this latter story is immortalized
in the Attis of Catullus. Attes is both son and lover of the great
mother-goddess, Cybele. For the worship of the mother and the
son in Asia Minor cf. Ramsay, C. and B. pp. 87, 264. The swine,

become by false interpretation the enemy of the God (Farnell,

point of view, is that H. (or his informants) has introduced a cultmyth 
into history; it has received a Greek colouring, for the steps
taken to avert calamity are the means of bringing it to pass. (Cf.
the myth of Oedipus.) The fact underlying the story seems to be
that Croesus had a son, Atys, who died young. For Atys' son,

Gk. literature in the fragment of the Aethiopis of Arctinus, where
Achilles is purified for the murder of Thersites. The old view was
(Grote, i. 25) that the idea of purification was not Greek and was
introduced from abroad; the usual modern view (Harrison, Prol. to
Study of Gk. Rel.) is that the chthonian worships, with which rites of
purification were connected, were pre-Homeric, i. e. pre-Achaean,

<p>A Dorian himself, H. identifies the Dorians with the Hellenes.
Hellas was originally a district in Thessaly, closely connected with
Phthia and ruled by Achilles (<bibl n="Hom. Il. 9.395">Il. ix. 395</bibl>), whose followers are
&lsquo;Myrmidons and Hellenes&rsquo; (<bibl n="Hom. Il. 2.684">Il. ii. 684</bibl>). But in the Catalogue
(ii. 530) it is also used as a general name, <foreign lang="greek">Πανέλληνες</foreign> (cf. <foreign lang="greek">καθ̓
Ἑλλάδα καὶ μέσον Ἄργος</foreign>, <bibl n="Hom. Od. 1.344">Od. i. 344</bibl> <foreign rend="ital">et pass.</foreign>&mdash;a verse condemned by
Aristarchus as an interpolation). &lsquo;Hellas&rsquo; was already used in a
general sense by Archilochus and Hesiod (Strabo, 370), i. e. in the
seventh century, and had become established in this sense before
580 B. C., when two &lsquo;Hellanodicae&rsquo; (cf. I. G. A. 112) were appointed
for the Olympic games; but the date depends on the reading in
<bibl n="Paus. 5.9.4">Paus. v. 9. 4</bibl>, 5, which is a little uncertain (cf. Frazer, P. i. 584;
iii. 489). Thucydides (i. 3) describes the transition from the special
to the general sense; this was probably due to the influence of the
myth of Achilles; as the Greeks, by contrast with the barbarians,
became conscious of their own similarity, it was natural they should
assume the name of the people whose chief was the hero of the
national epic and the type of heroic manhood. The adoption of the
name may be connected with the spread of Dorian influence (cf. <foreign lang="greek">Ζεὺς
Ἑλλάνιος</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">Ἀθανὰ Ἑλλανία</foreign> in the <foreign lang="greek">ῥήτρα</foreign> of Lycurgus, <bibl n="Plut. Lyc. 6">Plut. Lyc. 6</bibl>).</p>
<p>The origin of &lsquo;Hellenes&rsquo; is uncertain; it may be connected with
the <foreign lang="greek">Σελλοί</foreign>, the priests of Zeus at Dodona (<bibl n="Hom. Il. 16.234">Il. xvi. 234</bibl>, where Achilles
prays to this god). This is partially confirmed by Aristotle (Meteor.
i. 14, 352 A), who says that &lsquo;ancient Hellas&rsquo; was <foreign lang="greek">περὶ Δωδώνην</foreign>. For
the whole subject cf. Busolt, i. 196 seq. Bury has an ingenious theory
that the name received its first great extension in connexion with the
Achaean colonies in Magna Graecia (J. H. S. xv. 236); but his proof
is by no means complete.</p>
<p>This chapter (with c. 145, and viii. 43 and 73) is interesting as
showing that the story of the Dorian Invasion was fully developed
in H.'s time: he assumes its main points and even refers to details,
e. g. vi. 52, ix. 26. 3. The questions as to it may be summed up
under two heads:&mdash;
<pb n="77"/></p>
<div type="subsection" n="1">
<head>I. Evidence for reality of Dorian Invasion.</head>
<p>The oldest evidence for it is Tyrtaeus, fr. <hi rend="bold">2</hi> (in Str. 362)&mdash;
<quote lang="greek"><l>*zeu\s *(hraklei/dais th/nde de/dwke po/lin:</l>

<p>(Cf. <bibl n="Pind. P. 1">Pind. Pyth. i. 63</bibl> seq.) Beloch (R. M. xlv) argues that the story
is an invention, based on mistaken etymologies (e.g. of &lsquo;Naupactus&rsquo;)
and unhistorical combinations, to explain the difference between
Homeric Greece and Historic Greece. His arguments are briefly
these: (1) The evidence is late; there is nothing as to the migration
in Homer (but Homer is equally silent as to Greek migrations to Asia
Minor which are pretty generally accepted). (2) Race names are
very late (<bibl n="Thuc. 1.3">Thuc. i. 3</bibl>; but this argument confuses name and fact:
races exist as distinct, though their general names may be late).
(3) There was no real gap between &lsquo;Mycenaean&rsquo; and historic
times, e. g. a Dorian column is found in the Lion Gate at Mycenae.
The transition was gradual, but the Greeks, not understanding such
a process, invented a catastrophe. (This argument is not admitted
by archaeologists generally; it makes the Mycenaean culture too
late; cf. Busolt, i. 116 n.)</p>
<p>Arguments for the historic reality of the invasion are (cf. generally
Meyer, ii. 47): (1) Modern archaeological research tends to vindicate 
the accuracy of Greek myths in their general outlines. (2) If
tradition is ever good evidence, it would be so for an event of such
importance. (3) Tradition is confirmed by the existence of subject
classes (probably subject races) in many parts of the Peloponnese.
(4) The Dorians always looked on themselves as being new-comers
in the Peloponnese. (5) The tradition explains such facts as resemblance 
of Dorian and Aeolian dialects (Busolt, i. 195) and the connexion 
of the Lacedaemonians with Doris, which is of great importance 
in historic times (<bibl n="Thuc. 1.107.2">Thuc. i. 107. 2</bibl>).</p>
<p>It must be frankly admitted, however, that we know nothing of
the details of the Invasion.</p></div>
<div type="subsection" n="2">
<head>II. Main points as to Dorian Invasion.</head>
<p>(1) <hi rend="ital">As to its origin.</hi> It was part of a general movement from the
North, connected with the Phrygian migration (vii. 73), and perhaps
(but remotely) with the invasions of Egypt under the Nineteenth
Dynasty (cf. App. X. 8).</p>
<p>(2) <hi rend="ital">As to its course.</hi> (<foreign rend="ital">a</foreign>) The invaders were of mixed race; all
probability (cf. the invasion of the Cimbri and Teutones) confirms
tradition on this.</p>
<p>(<foreign rend="ital">b</foreign>) Doris was a stage in the progress of part of the invaders.</p>
<p>(<foreign rend="ital">c</foreign>) Some of the conquerors came by sea (cf. the local tradition
<pb n="78"/>
as to Solygeius (<bibl n="Thuc. 4.42.2">Thuc. iv. 42. 2</bibl>) and the Temeneion near Argos
(Strabo, 368)).</p>
<p>(<foreign rend="ital">d</foreign>) The conquest was gradual, and may have been assisted by
the discontented elements in the population of the Peloponnese.</p>
<p>(3) <hi rend="ital">As to its ultimate results.</hi> It was part of a series of movements. 
Thucydides (i. 2. 3) connects it, though not causally, with
the conquest of Boeotia; and it may have led to the migration to
Asia Minor (c. 145).</p></div></div3>
<div3 id="c.1.56.3" type="section" n="3">
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">τὸ μέν</lemma>: obviously the Pelasgic race, although this sense is inconsistent 
with what H. says of Pelasgians in Asia Minor (146. 1) or
of those in Attica (vi. 137); he writes too absolutely, having in view
only the contrast between the mass of the Athenians, who were
<foreign lang="greek">οὐ μετανάσται</foreign> (vii. 161. 3), and the much-wandering Dorians. These
are placed first in Phthiotis, because this was the traditional home
of Deucalion, the Greek Noah, the grandfather of Aeolus, Xuthus, and
Dorus. H. may be following the post-Homeric epic, &lsquo;Aegimius.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Histiaeotis was in north-west Thessaly; H. transfers it to the
north-east (the district really of Thessaliotis (57. 1)), probably in
accordance with Cretan tradition (for Dorians in Crete cf. <bibl n="Hom. Od. 19.177">Od.
xix. 177</bibl>). The invaders of Crete must have originally lived on the
sea coast.</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">Καδμείων</lemma>. For the Cadmeans cf. <ref target="c.5.61.2" targOrder="U">v. 61. 2 n.</ref>; as there it is said
that the Cadmeans fled to the Illyrian Encheleis, their migration
must have been to north-west; hence it is obvious that the legend
placed the Dorians in north-west Thessaly (not north-east).</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">Πίνδῳ</lemma>. P. is one of the towns of the Dorian Tetrapolis, the
others being Erineus (cf. viii. 43 and Tyrtaeus, <foreign rend="ital">u. s.</foreign>), Boeum, and
Cytinium (Strabo, 427); it lay on a river of the same name on the
south-east of Mount Oeta; for it cf. <cit><bibl n="Pind. P. 1">Pind. Pyth. i. 65</bibl> <quote lang="greek">e)/sxon d'
*)amu/klas o)/lbioi *pindo/qen o)rnu/menoi</quote></cit>. Others (less probably) take
Pindus to be the mountain chain, i. e. H. would bring his Dorians
from north-east to north-west Thessaly and then later (<foreign lang="greek">ἐνθεῦτεν
αὖθις</foreign>) to their home in Doris.</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">Μακεδνόν</lemma>. Stein doubts whether H. means to connect the Dorians
with the Macedonians (cf. viii. 43), arguing that H., if he had believed
this, would have explained the unusual form (<foreign lang="greek">Μακεδνόν</foreign>) by the
common one (<foreign lang="greek">Μακεδών</foreign>). It seems, however, as if H. must have
been thinking of the claim of the Macedonian kings to be Argives
(cf. v. 22. 2; viii. 137); but this would prove nothing as to connexion
of the races. He may be referring to some unknown tradition,
connecting the Dorians in north-west Thessaly with their Macedonian 
neighbours to the north; e. g. Myres (J. H. S. xxvii. 178)
shows that in the Homeric Catalogue the strip of coast between
Mount Olympus and the Axius is unaccounted for; he argues that
the Dorians (unknown to Homer except in <bibl n="Hom. Od. 19.177">Od. xix. 177</bibl>) had already
reached this.</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">Δρυοπίδα</lemma>. D. was the original name of the lower part of the
<pb n="79"/>
Pindus valley, which in historic times was Doris (viii. 31; cf. Strabo,
434). The Dryopians originally dwelt on both sides of Mount Oeta,
and south as far as Parnassus; they are said to have been expelled
from the coast by the Malians, and by Heracles from the Pindus
valley (<bibl n="Apollod. 2.7.7">Apollod. ii. 7. 7</bibl>). Heracles was especially honoured by the
Malians (vii. 176. 3), and in the east of Central Greece generally
(Meyer, ii. 166). Here the Dorians learned his worship, and made
his son Hyllus to be adopted by king Aegimius, and so to be the
ancestor of the Spartan kings. The expelled Dryopes settled at
Hermione and Asine in the Peloponnese (viii. 73. 2), at Styra (viii.
46. 4), and Carystus in Euboea (<bibl n="Thuc. 7.57.4">Thuc. vii. 57. 4</bibl>); also in Cythnus
(viii. 46. 4) and in Ionia (146. 1). For an account of the Dryopes,
based in part on cult usage, cf. <bibl n="Paus. 4.34.6">Paus. iv. 34. 6</bibl>.</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">οὕτως</lemma>: i. e. they get their Dorian name when they conquer the
Peloponnese. This is probably wrong; &lsquo;it is native in the upper
Cephissus valley&rsquo; (Meyer, ii. 47).</p></div3></div>
<div id="c.1.57" type="chapter" n="57">
<p>For H.'s Pelasgian theories and for the relation of Pelasgi to
Hellenes cf. App. XV. He here tries to infer the original language
of the whole people from survivals in his own day; his method is
scientific, whatever may be thought of his results.</p>
<div3 id="c.1.57.1" type="section" n="1">
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">Κρηστῶνα</lemma>. If this is read, Creston is a town in Thrace, north of
Chalcidice, on the high ground between the Axius and the Strymon;
this district is called <foreign lang="greek">Κρηστωνική</foreign> (vii. 124. 1; cf. <cit><bibl n="Thuc. 2.99.6">Thuc. ii. 99. 6</bibl> <quote lang="greek">*grhstwni/a</quote></cit>). 
This reading is open to objections: (1) Creston is not
definitely mentioned <hi rend="ital">as a town</hi> elsewhere except in St. Byz., who is
quoting H. (2) H. calls the inhabitants of the district <foreign lang="greek">Κρηστωναῖοι</foreign>
(v. 3. 2), not <foreign lang="greek">Κρηστωνιῆται</foreign> as here. (3) The only Pelasgians in this
district are in the Athos peninsula (<bibl n="Thuc. 4.109.4">Thuc. iv. 109. 4</bibl>), and these are
definitely called &lsquo;the Tyrsenians who formerly settled in Lemnos
and Athens&rsquo;; but H. distinguishes the people here from the
Tyrsenians and from the Pelasgians &lsquo;who lived with the Athenians&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Hence Niebuhr conjectured <foreign lang="greek">Κροτῶνα</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">Κροτωνιῆται</foreign> in &sect; 3, i. e.
Cortona in Etruria, originally an Umbrian town, which H. distinguishes 
from the famous Croton in South Italy by the words <foreign lang="greek">ὑπὲρ</foreign> T.
This conjecture has been widely accepted (e. g. by Meyer, F. i. 234); 
the reasons are:</p>
<p>(1) <foreign lang="greek">Τυρσηνοί</foreign> everywhere in H. means &lsquo;the Etruscans&rsquo;.</p>
<p>(2) Dion. Halic. i. 29, quoting this passage, <foreign lang="greek">καὶ γὰρ δὴ ... ἐν
φυλακῇ</foreign> (3), reads <foreign lang="greek">Κροτωνιῆται</foreign>, and (i. 18 seq.) describes the migration 
of the Pelasgians to Umbria, where they made Cortona their
chief town (cf. Hell. Fr. 1 for the same tradition; but Hell. identifies
the Pelasgians and the Etruscans).</p>
<p>(3) The reading <foreign lang="greek">Κρηστῶνα</foreign>, it is suggested, is a later correction,
based on an inaccurate remembrance of <bibl n="Thuc. 4.109">Thuc. iv. 109</bibl>.</p>
<p>For the objections to this conjecture cf. Myres, J. H. S. xxvii.
195 seq.; he argues 1) H. is unfamiliar with Italy, and would not
compare an Italian town with Aegean peoples; 2) he knows this
<pb n="80"/>
part of the Aegean coast-line well; 3) the passage of Thucydides
really confirms H. It may be added that the MSS. agree in giving
<foreign lang="greek">Κρηστῶνα</foreign>. For H.'s familiarity with North Italy cf. 196. 1.</p>
<p>Thessaliotis lay west of Olympus and Ossa (cf. 56. 3 for Dorians
there); it was more often called &lsquo;Pelasgiotis&rsquo;.</p></div3>
<div3 id="c.1.57.2" type="section" n="2">
<p>Placie and Scylace lay east of Cyzicus on the Propontis (here
called &lsquo;Hellespont&rsquo;; cf. <ref target="c.4.38.2" targOrder="U">iv. 38. 2 n.</ref>). For the expulsion of
&lsquo;Pelasgians&rsquo; from Attica cf. <ref target="c.6.137" targOrder="U">vi. 137 n.</ref>, from Lemnos, vi. 140, and
App. XV, &sect; 5.</p></div3>
<div3 id="c.1.57.3" type="section" n="3">
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">χαρακτῆρα</lemma>. H. uses this word of the four Ionian dialects (142. 4);
from this parallel Thirlwall (i. 53) argued that H. meant here that
&lsquo;the Pelasgian language ... sounded to him a strange jargon, as
did the dialect of Ephesus to a Milesian, and as the Bolognese does
to a Florentine&rsquo;. This is ingenious, but the Pelasgian question
cannot be settled so easily.</p></div3></div>
<div id="c.1.58" type="chapter" n="58">
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ἀποσχισθέν</lemma>. The sense of this word is shown in iv. 56. 1, where
H. uses it of a river separating from another; so in 143. 2, of the
&lsquo;separation&rsquo; of the Ionians of Asia Minor from the rest of the
Ionians. Obviously, therefore, H. thought his &lsquo;barbarian&rsquo; Pelasgi
closely akin to the Hellenes. In 60. 3 H. says <foreign lang="greek">τὸ Ἑλληνικὸν ἀπεκρίθη
τοῦ βαρβάρου ἔθνεος</foreign>, i. e. marked itself off as somewhat superior.
Thucydides (i. 3. 2) carries the process a stage further; the development 
is not &lsquo;spontaneous&rsquo;, but the result of &lsquo;contact with the
<foreign lang="greek">φύσις</foreign> of the genuine Hellene&rsquo;; T. s' &lsquo;explanation of the transmissibility

Anaxandridas that <foreign lang="greek">τυραννίδας κατέλυσαν</foreign>; it goes on to mention
Hippias of Athens and Aeschines of Sicyon, apparently as put
down by these two (cf. Plut. de Mal. H. 21, and App. XVI, &sect; 10);
but the fragment breaks off suddenly. This tradition may well be
true in the main, though the chronology is inaccurate. For his connexion 
with the Lycurgean discipline cf. c. 65 n. He was reckoned
as one of the Seven Sages (cf. 27. 2 n.), and Plut. (Mor. 35 F) says
a collection of his pithy sayings was extant. Cf. vii. 235. 2 for his

opposition to <foreign lang="greek">ἔργῳ</foreign>, &lsquo;nominally&rsquo; he was for others, really for himself; 
but this is forced. Myres (A. and C. p. 165) says: &lsquo;the

from the Acropolis in spring can &lsquo;recognize the abrupt change from
emerald green to purple and brown, which tells where <foreign lang="greek">πεδίον</foreign> and
cornland end, and the goats of the <foreign lang="greek">ὑπεράκρια</foreign> begin&rsquo;.</p>
<p>The rise of these factions was the natural result of the Solonian
changes, which had broken down the traditional rule of the Eupatridae. 
The local divisions, on which the factions were largely
based, are reflected in the myth of the four sons of Pandion (Strabo,
392); but no doubt the main struggle was between the old landed
aristocracy and the rising mercantile class.</p>
<p>The <foreign lang="greek">παραλία</foreign> is the southern half of Attica, the triangle terminating 
in Sunium, the <foreign lang="greek">πεδίον</foreign> is the south-west of Attica, the basin
of the Cephissus and the Thriasian plain. Cf. <cit><bibl n="Thuc. 2.55.1">Thuc. ii. 55. 1</bibl> <quote lang="greek">oi(

silver mines&rsquo;. Ure (Origin of the Tyrannis, J. H. S. xxvi. 136)
suggests that the <foreign lang="greek">Διάκριοι</foreign> are not local, but are &lsquo;the mining population 
of Attica&rsquo; supporting &lsquo;the great mine-owner, Pisistratus&rsquo;. But,
not to speak of the evidence of Thucydides (<foreign rend="ital">u. s.</foreign>), there is no reason
to think that any large section of the Athenian population was employed 
in the mines at this time, even if free men ever worked there,
which is very doubtful; Solon, fr. 13. 49-50, quoted by Ure, refers
to manufactures not to mines.</p>
<p>H. differs from A. P. 13. 4 in making the third faction later than
the rest (it certainly would be organized later); he also gives its
name differently, <foreign lang="greek">ὑπεράκριοι</foreign>, not <foreign lang="greek">διάκριοι</foreign> (cf. <bibl n="Plut. Sol. 29">Plut. Sol. 29</bibl> for the latter
form).</p>

of Pericles, whose second son was called &lsquo;Paralus&rsquo;. Lycurgus was
an Eteobutad; to this aristocratic faction belonged the Philaidae;
cf. vi. 35 seq. for the story of their chief, Miltiades.</p>
<p>The faction of Pisistratus was in east and north-east Attica; his
own deme, <foreign lang="greek">Φιλαΐδαι</foreign> (<bibl n="Plut. Sol. 10">Plut. Sol. 10</bibl>), lay near Brauron some twenty
miles south of Marathon; cf. c. 62 for his strength in this region.
Near Brauron was discovered the <foreign lang="greek">στήλη</foreign> of an Aristion, who may
well be (Bury, pp. 192-3) the man of that name who proposed (A. P.
14. 1) the tyrant's bodyguard.</p></div3>

<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">δῆθεν</lemma> shows the statement is false; cf. 73. 5. The <foreign lang="greek">πολυθρύλητον

tyranny.</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">στρατηγίῃ</lemma>. H. probably uses this word in a non-technical sense,
but even if he meant it to be technical, it would prove nothing; he
is often anachronistic in his constitutional details; cf. <ref target="c.6.109" targOrder="U">vi. 109 n.</ref>
There is no evidence for the existence of the <foreign lang="greek">στρατηγοί</foreign> before Cleisthenes, 
except in the more than suspicious &lsquo;Constitution of Draco&rsquo;
(A. P. 4); if they existed, they were mere subordinates of the Polemarch. 
For the tyrant owing his rise to distinction in war cf. Ar.
Pol. v. 5. 6-8 (1305 A) with Newman's note. For the chronology of
the wars with Megara cf. Busolt, ii. 217 seq. Some (e. g. Sayce)
have supposed that H. makes here a mistake similar to that as to
Croesus and Solon (cf. c. 29 nn.), introducing Pisistratus into a war
that really belongs to the previous generation. Others (e. g. Beloch,
i. 327) make Pisistratus the conqueror of Salamis, not Solon; but
apart from Solon's own poems (frags. 2 and 3) all tradition gives
the conquest to the older man. It is more natural therefore to
suppose that the Megarian war, victoriously ended by Solon (<bibl n="Plut. Sol. 10">Plut.
Sol. 10</bibl>), had been renewed during the confusion at Athens that
followed his legislation (cf. A. P. 13), or perhaps even before his
legislation, as Plutarch (c. 12) definitely states, and that the struggle
with Megara was finally ended by Pisistratus; Justin, ii. 8, describes
the capture of Nisaea by him, though without naming the town.</p>
<p>The inscription discovered in 1884 may perhaps refer to the settlement 
of Salamis after the conquest by Pisistratus; but others date
it at the end of the sixth century (cf. Hicks, pp. 6-7; Busolt, ii.
444 n. 2).</p></div3>

<p>The story of the sham Athene is one of the most curious in H.;
he is shocked by it, and introduces sarcastic touches (e.g. <foreign lang="greek">σχῆμα
οἷόν τι ἔμελλε</foreign>) into it; but he completely believes it. Grote has an
excellent note (iv. 32) on the contrast between the views of the
sixth and of the fifth century, implied in H.'s criticism here; he
compares the contrast of views as to a combat of champions in
H. i. 82 and <bibl n="Thuc. 5.41">Thuc. v. 41</bibl>. As H. had met possibly the sons and
certainly the grandsons of men who had seen the restoration, and
as he carefully sifted his traditions as to the Pisistratidae (cf.
<ref target="c.5.55.1" targOrder="U">v. 55. 1 n.</ref>), it is safer to accept the story, as e. g. Grote, Curtius,
Busolt (ii. 321), and others do. Cf. vi. 105. 3 for Athenian acceptance 
of the supernatural (Pan and Philippides). Somewhat similar
acts are that of Telines (vii. 153) and the share of St. Catherine in
the return of Gregory XI to Rome in 1376. Beloch, however (Rh.
Mus. 45, 1890, whom Meyer, F. ii. 248, follows), rejects the whole
story as a &lsquo;poetic variation of the historic tradition of the victory at
Pallene&rsquo;. The argument is as follows: the victory was gained at
the temple of Athene Pallenis (c. 62. 3); hence Athene was metaphorically 
said to have restored Pisistratus. The metaphorical
version grew into a myth, perhaps with the assistance of a commemorative 
monument&mdash;this suggestion had been made by Stein
before Beloch&mdash;and then the fiction found a place in history, side by
side with the real fact. Beloch concludes that Pisistratus was only
restored <emph>once</emph> and expelled <emph>once</emph>, and that the intrigue with Megacles
belongs to the first usurpation.</p>
<p>It argues almost greater credulity to suppose that history and
myth could become thus inextricably mixed in the course of two
generations than to accept the story of Phya. It may be noted
that there is independent fourth-century evidence for the story in
A. P. 14. 4 and in Cleidemus (Athen. 609 C; F. H. G. i. 364), who
makes Phya wife of Hipparchus.</p>

(this is implied here) and was restored by Pisistratus (64. 2). If
we may trust Polyaenus (i. 23) he had assisted Polycrates to obtain
the tyranny of Samos, thus forming a link between the two great
Ionian tyrants. He seems to combine the two characters of democratic

<p>H. gives two notes of time as to the Pisistratid rule, in this
passage and in v. 65. 3 (that it lasted thirty-six years): Aristotle
(Pol. v. 12. 5, 1315 b 32) gives it thirty-five years, and to Pisistratus
himself seventeen; A. P. 17. 1 gives him nineteen years. There
are numerous other data in A. P. cc. 14-17, but they are hopelessly
confused; see Sandys on A. P. 14. 3 for a discussion of the subject.</p>
<p>The ultra-sceptical view is that of Beloch (i. 328), that the traditional 
dates are merely based on calculations of generations, one
for Pisistratus himself and a half for his sons, i. e. 33+17 = 50
years in all, and that one-half of his rule is given to exile. Rejecting 
this argument as a not very probable guess, we may take the
following dates as approximate: First tyranny, 560-559, archonship
of Comeas (this traditional date is accepted even by Beloch). First
exile, 555. Second tyranny, 550. Second exile, 549. Third tyranny,

<p>1. The evidence for him is late; apart from Simonides (Plut.
<pb n="86"/>
Lyc. 1) H. is our oldest witness; the fragments of Tyrtaeus never
mention him; yet it is equally hard to believe either that Tyrtaeus
would have said nothing of Lycurgus, had he ever existed, or that
any mention of him by Tyrtaeus, had there been one, would have
failed to be quoted when the subject was so much discussed.</p>
<p>2. The statements as to Lycurgus are contradictory (cf. 65. 4 for
variations of date); and his work was attributed by Hellanicus to
Eurysthenes and Procles (Fr. 91; F. H. G. i. 57).</p>
<p>3. His name (i. e. &lsquo;Wolfheart&rsquo;, Meyer, <foreign rend="ital">u. s.</foreign> 281, or &lsquo;LightWorker&rsquo;, 
Gilbert) is suspicious, as are also those of his father
(Eunomus or Prytanis, Plut. 1), and of his son (Eucosmus, <bibl n="Paus. 3.16.5">Paus. iii.
16. 5</bibl>).</p>
<p>4. He was worshipped as a god at Sparta (<foreign rend="ital">v. i.</foreign>), and Meyer
(ii. 277) denies that we find mortals deified in Greece before
Alexander; but this is doubtful.</p>
<p>5. Greek legends tended to ascribe all institutions to some lawgiver; 
cf. Solon, Zaleucus, &amp;c. &lsquo;The omnipotence of law&rsquo; is a
&lsquo;strange Greek superstition&rsquo;; &lsquo;they have no sufficient conception of
the way in which things are stronger than men, and the passive
resistance of circumstances stronger than the insight and will of an
individual&rsquo; (Oncken, Arist. Staats.-Lehre, i. 244-5).</p>
<p>Meyer (F. i. 279) goes so far as to suggest that the legend of
Lycurgus as founder grew up &lsquo;gradually after the Persian wars,
when the Spartans became conscious of the peculiar character of
their native institutions&rsquo;. He is &lsquo;borrowed from the original population, 
like the cults of Helen, the Dioscuri, and Agamemnon&rsquo;
(ib. p. 282). Hence Lyc. is a &lsquo;heroized divinity&rsquo;; Gilbert makes
him a form of Apollo <foreign lang="greek">Αύκειος</foreign>, Meyer (ib. 282, following Wilamowitz)
and Busolt of Zeus <foreign lang="greek">Λυκαῖος</foreign> (the &lsquo;Wolf-Zeus&rsquo;), an Arcadian god.

<p>1. Because of the analogy of similar legends; Charlemagne,
Roland, and Archbishop Turpin are historical persons, however
much their story was embellished in the Chansons de Geste (cf. the
discussion as to the historical existence of King Arthur, E. B. ii<hi rend="sup">9</hi>. 651).</p>
<p>2. The peculiar character of Spartan institutions is best explained
by the dominating personality of some individual, who did not invent 
them, but who systematized them and rendered them permanent. 
Holm (i. 188) well compares the part played by the Doge
Gradenigo in settling the Venetian constitution, Reich the foundation
by great personalities of the religious orders in the Roman Church.</p>
<p><hi rend="bold">III. Lycurgus a historical fiction.</hi></p>
<p>A further difficulty arises from the archaeological discoveries of
the British School at Sparta since 1906: these show that the city
was a centre of art down to after 600 B.C., and then almost suddenly 
ceases to be so. It is possible that the Lycurgean <foreign lang="greek">ἀγωγή</foreign>
actually dates from this period, and was the work of a reformer
<pb n="87"/>
(perhaps of Chilon, cf. 59. 2 n.), who attributed his drastic innovations
to a supposed ancient founder, or that at any rate an old and weakly
enforced discipline was reintroduced in a stricter form. (For this
latter view cf. Dickins in Class. Quart. v. 241.) Such a view would
account for the absence of genuine tradition as to Lycurgus,
while it satisfies the main argument for his existence, viz. that a
strong personality is needed to explain so peculiar a development.</p>
<p>If, however, we accept the personality of Lycurgus (Frazer, v. 606,
goes so far as to say &lsquo;It should never have been called in question&rsquo;),
it must be admitted that we know nothing of him; H.'s account
is not real history; it is only valuable as the fifth century official
Lacedaemonian account of history. (See Note D, p. 449.)</p></div>

original humanity.</p></div3>
<div3 id="c.1.65.4" type="section" n="4">
<p>It is worth while to tabulate the more important differences
between the Herodotean and the other accounts of Lycurgus:</p>
<p>1. H. denies that he derived his institutions from Delphi; but
this was the usual fourth century account, e. g. <bibl n="Xen. Const. Lac. 8.5">Xen. Rep. Lac. viii.
5</bibl> and <bibl n="Plat. Laws 624a">Plat. Leg. 624</bibl>; cf. 691 E. Meyer (F. i. 231 seq.) ingeniously
ascribes this later view to King Pausanias (408-395 B. C.), and
maintains that the verses of Tyrtaeus (<bibl n="Plut. Lyc. 6">Plut. Lyc. 6</bibl>) which assert it
are a later forgery.</p>
<p>2. H. makes Lycurgus guardian of Leobotes, his nephew, i. e.
<pb n="88"/>
he is an Agiad and his date is about 1000 B.C. But Simonides
(<bibl n="Plut. Lyc. 1">Plut. Lyc. 1</bibl>) makes him a Eurypontid and uncle of Charilaus (king
884 B. C.); so too Ar. Pol. ii. 10. 2, 1271 B. Plut. (ib.) also quotes
Aristotle for a third date, i. e. Lycurgus is put in the eighth century,
and made to organize &lsquo;the Olympic Truce&rsquo; (on the strength of the
inscription on &lsquo;the quoit at Olympia&rsquo;). No wonder Timaeus thought
there were two Lycurgi.</p>
<p>3. H. makes him legislate as regent, Ephorus (Strabo, 482) at a
time when Charilaus was actually king.</p>
<p>4. H. gives him the whole Spartan constitution; but <foreign rend="ital">v. i.</foreign> for
other dates for the Ephorate and Gerousia.</p>
<p>It may be added that the one point on which traditions agree,
viz. that he legislated as uncle of the king, was an obvious guess;
for his name was not on the royal list, and yet men felt he must
have been a Heracleid.</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">κόσμον</lemma>. The well-known Spartan <foreign lang="greek">ἀγωγή</foreign> is implied; H. gives
this to Lycurgus as a matter of course.</p>
<p>For a comparison of the institutions of Sparta and of Crete cf.
Ar. Pol. ii. 10 (1271 B seq.). Ephorus (Strabo, 481-2) argued
elaborately for the priority of Crete; but his view as to the
similarity of the two constitutions is criticized by Polybius (vi. 45-6);
there is not sufficient evidence to decide the question. The institutions 
are in each case the expression of &lsquo;the warrior life of a
conquering primitive people&rsquo; (Oncken) surrounded by enemies and
hostile subjects.</p></div3>
<div3 id="c.1.65.5" type="section" n="5">

his return (<bibl n="Plut. Lyc. 29">Plut. Lyc. 29</bibl>); this is probably borrowed from the
story as to Solon (c. 29. 2). So, too, the statement that he travelled
is considered by some to be an invention copied from the genuine
travels of the Athenian.</p>
<p>The <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ἐνωμοτίη</lemma>, i. e. &lsquo;sworn brotherhood&rsquo;, was the smallest tactical 
unit of the army, containing in 418 B.C. about thirty-two men

<p>The <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">συσσίτια</lemma> were originally military organizations, the band of
warriors united by the common meal.</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ἐφόρους</lemma>. Three views are taken as to H.'s statements about the
Ephors and the Gerousia:</p>
<p>(1) That both statements are right; Ephors and Gerousia were
part of the primitive constitution, and so associated with Lycurgus.
Cf. Xen. Rep. Lac. c. 8 for Ephors, c. 10 for Gerousia; Isocrates,
Panath. 165-6. Meyer (F. i. 246) accepts this view; holding that
<pb n="89"/>
Lycurgus has no historical reality, he identifies his supposed
institutions with the primitive constitution.</p>
<p>(2) That the first is right and the second wrong. Clearly the
<foreign lang="greek">γέροντες</foreign> are the old council of chiefs and pre-Lycurgean; but
the Ephors may be definite officers, created by Lycurgus to
superintend the <foreign lang="greek">ἀγωγή</foreign>.</p>
<p>(3) That both statements are wrong. The Ephorate is assigned
to a date later than Lycurgus, i. e. the reign of Theopompus: for
(<foreign rend="ital">a</foreign>) Aristotle (Pol. v. 11. 2, 1313 A) tells the story of his answer that he
left the kingship <foreign lang="greek">ελάττων</foreign> but <foreign lang="greek">πολυχρονιωτέρα</foreign> (cf. Plat. Leg. 692;
<bibl n="Plut. Lyc. 7">Plut. Lyc. 7</bibl>, Cleom. 10). (<foreign rend="ital">b</foreign>) The list of ephors begins 755-754 B.C.,
i. e. in the reign of Theopompus (but this date, if it be historical at
all, might refer to an alteration in the power of an old office).
Meyer (F. i. 250) argues that the post-Lycurgean date for the
Ephorate is due to King Pausanias (cf. 65. 4 n.) and the constitutional
struggles at Sparta early in the fourth century. Owing to the
authority of Aristotle (<foreign rend="ital">u. s.</foreign>), it displaced the earlier view and was
generally adopted.</p>
<p>All we can say for certain is that (1) the Ephorate is found in the
colonies of Thera, Cyrene, and the Tarentine Heraclea, and so may
have been an early institution in Sparta, their reputed <foreign lang="greek">μητρόπολις</foreign> (but
cf. iv. 145 nn.); (2) that the office was closely connected with the
<foreign lang="greek">ἀγωγή</foreign>. For the whole subject of the Ephorate cf. Busolt, i. 555 seq.</p></div3></div>

Athens (circ. 470 B.C.; <bibl n="Plut. Cim. 8">Plut. Cim. 8</bibl>). The present translation is the

<p>Two ideas underlie the Lacedaemonian policy:</p>

<p>(1) They are placed on the south-west of the Caspian, though not
touching it (Strabo, 514; in 509 S. puts them in Media), but had
originally a greater extension to the south-west; so Xanthus, fr. 3
(F. H. G. i. 36) places L. Urmiah (L. Matianus) among them.</p>
<p>(2) This wider sense is the usual one in H.; the Matieni (iii. 94. 1),
are grouped with the Saspeires (south-east of Trapezus) and the
Alarodii (in valley of Araxes) in the eighteenth satrapy; so the
Araxes rises <foreign lang="greek">ἐκ Ματιηνῶν</foreign> (202. 3).</p>

= &lsquo;Matienian Mountains&rsquo; (189. 1), and in v. 49. 6, 52. 4-5 Matiene
fills the whole space between Armenia and Susiana, and is crossed
by the Royal Road in thirty-four stages; i. e. it includes what H.
elsewhere calls &lsquo;Assyria&rsquo;, and = modern Turkish and Persian
Kurdistan. But H. is inconsistent: for in v. 52. 4 he makes the

Greater Zab rise in Armenia, though its source, being south-east of
that of the Araxes, should be in Matiene.</p>
<p>(4) Quite different is the meaning in the passage here and in
vii. 72. 2, which put the Matieni on the bend of the Halys, near the
Paphlagonians.</p>
<p>Reinach conjectures they were once a widespread race, reaching
from the Halys to near the Caspian; but they were cut in two by
Armenian immigration, and so survived at two ends of their former
home; perhaps they may = the &lsquo;Mitani&rsquo; of Tell-El-Amarna tablets.

<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">πέντε</lemma>: this estimate is repeated ii. 34. 2, where Sinope is given as
the northern limit; but the distance from Sinope to the Mediterranean 
is about 350 miles, while Asia Minor is 300 miles across where
narrowest. Moreover, the route across Asia Minor is through difficult 
country. Similarly Pliny (<bibl n="Plin. Nat. 6.7">N. H. vi. 7</bibl>) gives the distance as
&lsquo;200 miles&rsquo;. Some suppose that H. has confused with the
ordinary time for the journey the &lsquo;record&rsquo; of Persian couriers (cf. viii.
98. 2 for their relays). Pheidippides (vi. 106. 1) is credited with about
140 miles in two days, and Rawlinson (<foreign rend="ital">ad hunc loc.</foreign>) says a modern
Persian courier covers 50 miles a day. But H. is speaking simply of
an <foreign lang="greek">εὔζωνος</foreign>, i. e. <foreign rend="ital">expeditus</foreign>, and he elsewhere calculates a day's journey
at 200 stadia, i.e. about 23 miles (iv. 101. 3). We can explain the
mistake easily if we suppose that H. misunderstood his informant;
it was &lsquo;about five days' journey&rsquo; from Sinope to the northern
boundary of the Persian Cilicia (iii. 90. 3); H. took the distance as
referring to the southern boundary. Meyer (ii. 287) thinks the
mistake proves that there was a direct road across Asia Minor here.

had, however, begun their aggressions on Argive territory before
this, for H. (vii. 235. 2) implies that Cythera was theirs soon after
600 B. C. The conquest of the east coast may well have been gradual.
The chronologers speak of a Lacedaemonian victory in Thyrea
under Polydorus in 718 B. C., and Pausanias (iii. 2. 2) puts the
conquest of Cynuria down to Echestratus (1059-1025); but these
are probably inventions. The Argive chronology seems to have
been artificially constructed in periods of fifty years, reckoning back
from the Battle of Mantinea in 418; we have 718 as here, and 668,

bring out the coincidence of the &lsquo;fourteen days&rsquo; and the &lsquo;fourteen
years&rsquo;.</p>
<p>For the date of the capture of Sardis cf. Busolt, ii. 459-60. The
usual date, 546 B.C., is that of Eusebius and most of the chronologers;
the Parian marble, however, made it 541, and this date seems to
have been that given by Xanthus: between these two dates it is
impossible to decide. Duncker (iv. 326) put it in 549, as he thought
it must have preceded (cf. 90. 4) the burning of the Delphic temple
(548, 50. 3 n.), but this conjecture has not been generally accepted.</p>
<p>As to the fate of Croesus we have two contradictory traditions:</p>
<p>I. <hi rend="ital">That he perished.</hi> Bacchyl. iii. 23-63 (Ode to Hiero, 468 B.C.;
Jebb, pp. 195-7, 256-61) makes the pyre voluntary; Apollo carries
Croesus off to the land of the Hyperboreans. This is confirmed,
as to the voluntary nature of the act, by the Louvre amphora
(No. 194, figured J. H. S. xviii. 268, where it is dated circ. 500, and
in Bury, p. 228). The authority for this tradition is therefore slightly
the older.</p>
<p>II. <hi rend="ital">That he was spared.</hi> We have this in three main forms:
(<foreign rend="ital">a</foreign>) That of H., supported by Ephorus (<bibl n="Diod. 9.34">Diod. ix. 34</bibl>; cf. also Nic.
Dam. fr. 68 (F. H. G. iii. 407), who adds embellishments of his
own). (<foreign rend="ital">b</foreign>) <bibl n="Xen. Cyrop. 7.2">Xen. Cyr. vii. 2</bibl> makes Croesus spared to be the adviser
of Cyrus, but omits all marvels. (<foreign rend="ital">c</foreign>) Ctesias (c. 4, p. 64) says nothing
of the pyre, but makes Croesus saved by other marvels, and adds
that Cyrus gave him the town of Barene (near Ecbatana).</p>
<p>There is, apart from the miraculous elements, the further objection 
to the story that Cyrus, as a fire-worshipper, would not have
polluted the sacred element (cf. iii. 16. 2). It may be argued that,
not to speak of the possibility of mad freaks like those of Cambyses,
Cyrus' beliefs sat lightly on him (cf. the Cylinder Inscription, R. P.<hi rend="sup">2</hi>
v. 166-8, for his behaviour to the Babylonian gods, and Tac. Ann.
iii. 62). But the objection, though not itself decisive, is serious.</p>
<p>To return to the main difficulty: it is hard to believe that Croesus
perished (as Maspero holds, p. 656), in defiance of the independent
evidence of Ctesias and of H. The latter also tells stories of Croesus
later (cc. 155, 207, iii. 14, 36) which could hardly have gained currency
as to a dead man; they seem, moreover, to come from sources
different from those of the Lydian history. The explanation then
of Bacchylides' story may be that he gives, as Jebb shows, a Delian
version of the facts. Croesus was, so to speak, canonized as a model
of piety (this is implied in his being represented on a vase at all,
C. R. 1898, p. 85), and so a myth had grown up around him; cf. for
his religious character <bibl n="Pind. P. 1">Pind. Pyth. i. 94</bibl>, his <foreign lang="greek">φιλόφρων ἀρετά</foreign>.</p>
<p>We may then reject the evidence of Bacchylides, and assume that
Croesus survived; but it is difficult to decide the further points:</p>
<p>(1) Meyer, i<hi rend="sup">1</hi>. 503, thinks his pyre was a solemn act of selfdevotion; 
cf. for instances of voluntary burnings vii. 107 (Boges),
vii. 167 (Hamilcar), 1 Kings 16. 18 (Zimri), and the legend of
<pb n="99"/>
Sardanapallus, the last king of Nineveh (F. H. G. ii. 505). This is
the most probable view; it is supported by the oldest evidence, and
consistent with Cyrus' religious beliefs.</p>
<p>(2) N&ouml;ldeke (E. B.<hi rend="sup">9</hi> xviii. 566) accepts the pyre as the act of

<p>(3) A less probable view is that the whole pyre story is an
invention, due to the confusion of myth with history. This view
makes Croesus to be confused with the sun-god, Sandon, who

an advance on the early idea that the gods themselves were ruled

<p>H. here winds up his Lydian history. This chapter shows
Croesus in a new light, as a cruel Oriental prince (&sect; 4), and also
gives a non-Delphian account of his oracular success (contrast
c. 49). It clearly comes from another source. As it is not likely
to be a later addition, it is probably a fragment of H.'s original
material, which he has not worked into harmony with his narrative.</p>
<p>The temple of Ismenian Apollo (cf. viii. 134. 1; v. 59) was just
outside the city of Thebes, on the hill of St. Luke (<bibl n="Paus. 9.10.2">Paus. ix. 10. 2</bibl>
and Frazer, v. 40). Tripods were especially dedicated at it (<cit><bibl n="Pind. P. 11">Pind.
Pyth. xi. 4</bibl> <quote lang="greek">tripo/dwn qhsauro/n</quote></cit>). Divination at it was by inspection
of fire and ashes (cf. <bibl n="Soph. Ant. 1005-11">Soph. Ant. 1005-11</bibl>). Every eight years it
was the scene of the Daphnephoria, familiar from Leighton's great
picture. Golden &lsquo;cows&rsquo; were perhaps dedicated (as a symbol of
fertility) to Artemis, as representing the great &lsquo;Mother Goddess&rsquo;
(cf. App. I, &sect; 2).</p>
<p>For the Artemision cf. Hogarth, Excavations at Ephesus, 1908,
especially pp. 5-8, 245-6. The earliest shrine was probably at
Ortygia, under Mount Solmissus, to the south of Ephesus; this was
no doubt earlier than the Greek settlement (cf. <bibl n="Paus. 7.2.6">Paus. vii. 2. 6</bibl>, who
rejects the statement of Pindar that it was founded by the
Amazons; but <foreign lang="greek">παρθένοι</foreign> were always associated with the cult);
the earliest, near the city itself, dated from about 700; this was
destroyed by the Cimmerians circ. 660 B.C. The next two temples
followed rapidly, and then the famous one, which owed so much
to Croesus, was begun about 550. It seems not to have been
finished till about 430, and was destroyed by the arson of Herostratus 
in 356. Pliny (<bibl n="Plin. Nat. 37.26">N. H. xxxvii. 98</bibl>) states that the Hellenistic
temple which followed had 127 columns, &lsquo;a singulis regibus factae&rsquo;
(obviously in contrast to <foreign lang="greek">αἱ πολλαί</foreign> here). Hogarth (pp. 327 seq.)
points out that the &lsquo;many-breasted&rsquo; Artemis as a coin type seems
to belong to Roman times, not to be archaic.</p>
<p>Croesus' name can still be read on an Ephesian column-base in
the B. M. (Cat. i. 29; Hicks, p. 7).</p>
<p>Athena's temple at Delphi stood near the entrance to Apollo's;
hence the epithet &lsquo;of the fore-shrine&rsquo;, which is confirmed by inscriptions 
(Ditt. i. 186). The same epithet is used of Athena and Hermes,
in reference to the shrine of the Ismenian Apollo (<bibl n="Paus. 9.10.2">Paus. ix. 10. 2</bibl>).</p>
<p>For A. <foreign lang="greek">Προναία</foreign> at Delphi cf. <ref target="c.8.37.2" targOrder="U">viii. 37. 2 n.</ref>, <bibl n="Aesch. Eum. 21">Aesch. Eum. 21</bibl>, and

with an ethical significance (Farnell, G. C. i. 306).</p></div3>

the story that they were treacherously handed over to Xerxes by the

similarity of weight and form, and on the supposed lack of Croesusinscriptions 
(but cf. 51. 5 n.) at Delphi, C. Niebuhr founds the wild
theory that Croesus never gave gifts to Delphi at all, but that the
Branchidae offerings were feloniously transferred thither, about the
time of the Ionic Revolt (Mitt. der Vorder-As. Gesell. 1899, pp. 27-8).

the second century A. D., as to a woman of considerable position,
<foreign lang="greek">παλλακεύσασα καὶ κατὰ χρησμόν</foreign>, and no doubt such religious prostitution 
had been more common in early times. But there is no good
evidence that it was ever universal in Lydia; and the custom itself
may be paralleled in countries of quite different religions, e. g. in
Japan. L. Oliphant (Lord Elgin's Mission (1857-9) ii. 496 says:
&lsquo;No disgrace attaches to women who have been brought up in this
manner (i.e. as courtesans), and they generally make good marriages.&rsquo;

as to the invention of coinage is usually accepted as in the main
accurate (G. F. Hill, G. and R. C. p. 7, Hist. Gk. Coins, 1-2, 18-20;
Head, H. N. 643). Pollux ix. 83 quotes Xenophanes (fl. circ. 540) for
the same statement, but he quotes also four divergent views. Bars
and rings of metal of uniform weight had been used in Egypt and
Babylon, but these needed frequent reweighing; coinage begins
when some authority issuing coins guarantees the value by a stamp.
The invention was natural for the Lydians, who, as &lsquo;the Phoenicians 
of the land&rsquo;, held the outlets of the great Eastern trade-routes.
So the Aeginetans, the &lsquo;pedlars of Greece Proper&rsquo;, were the
earliest coiners there. P. Gardner, however (B. A. P. iii. 110 seq.),
thinks the earliest coins were probably of Asiatic Greek origin,
perhaps struck privately by temples or bankers.</p>
<p>The earliest Lydian coins date from the reign of Gyges; cf.
<foreign lang="greek">Γυγάδας χρυσός</foreign>, Poll. iii. 87, vii. 98; both passages imply that
Gyges struck coins of gold of peculiar purity; but the earliest
coins were really of electrum (cf. 50. 2 n.); they were oval in
shape, with a type on one side and punch-mark on the other.
B. V. Head (in Hogarth, E. E.) considers that eleven of the seventyeight 
Lydian coins found at Ephesus in the temple deposit are
at latest of the time of Gyges; but he thinks they were issued
privately and not by the king; the earliest royal Lydian coins
were those of Alyattes, whose name perhaps can be read on some
of them (H. N. 645).</p>
<p>Croesus introduced a gold and silver coinage, stamped with the
confronting heads of a lion and a bull. The Aeginetans had
anticipated him in silver (Hill, G. C. p. 20 and Pl. 1); but the statements 
of Ephorus, that Pheidon first coined silver in Aegina
(Strabo, 376) and that he invented gold and silver coinage (Strabo,
358), are probably merely embellishments of H.'s statement as to
his measures (vi. 127. 3 n.).</p>
<p>H. then may well be right as to the priority of the Lydians, but
<pb n="103"/>
he omits the early electron coins, in view of the more famous
issues of Croesus, and he is wrong in saying the Lydians were
the first to coin &lsquo;silver&rsquo;. For the standards cf. Hill, G. C. p. 18.</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">κάπηλοι</lemma>. This statement as to &lsquo;retail trade&rsquo; is, taken literally,
false; such trade was familiar in Egypt and Babylon much earlier;
but the Lydians were proverbially a nation of shopkeepers; cf. the
proverb <foreign lang="greek">Λυδὸς καπηλεύει</foreign> (P. G. ii. 510). Radet, pp. 295 f., gives a
brilliant picture of the wealth and vice of Sardis.</p></div3>

with contempt in the early days of criticism (cf. Mommsen, R. H.
i. 128 seq.), and the Etruscans were brought into Italy by land
from the north. Modern archaeology is now accumulating evidence
which confirms Greek tradition; it tends to show that native
Italian civilization in the north developed without interruption
from abroad, while Etruscan civilization in Central Italy was
introduced by sea (like that of Carthage), and resembles that of the
later Aegean periods, e.g. in its Cyclopean walls. (Cf. A. and A.

The colours of the seven circles are no doubt connected with the

mainly produced by glazed bricks (cf. the frescoes in the Louvre

the situation of the <foreign lang="greek">Παρητακηνοί</foreign> iii. 92. 1 n.). Ammianus (xxiii. 6. 32

speaks of them (&sect; 35) as &lsquo;inhabiting towns without walls&rsquo; in Media,
where they live &lsquo;protected by religious awe&rsquo;. But the local tribe
had an especially religious development (cf. the tribe of Levi in
Palestine), and the priesthood was confined to its members; so
among the Parsees to this day only the son of a Dastur can be
a Dastur (Darmstetter, S. B. E. iv. p. xlvii). Perhaps some of the
tribes were non-Aryan.</p></div>

<p>The conquest of Persia by the Medes is disputed, because it is

Achaemenids as far back as Teispes I (perhaps circ. 675), and Cyrus
calls his three immediate ancestors &lsquo;great king&rsquo; (App. IV, &sect; 1);
but this does not disprove H.'s statement, for apart from the possibility 
of filial flattery, in any case Persia must have been dependent
on Media in the time of the next king, Cyaxares; and the reference
in Ez. 38. 5 to Persia as an ally of Gog (circ. 580 B.C.) is too late and
too vague to prove anything. All we can say is that H.'s statement

humbled (648), and Elam wiped out (circ. 640). But the mistake

<p>For the Cimmerian-Scythian invasions in general cf. c. 15 nn.
H.'s chief mistakes here are that&mdash;</p>
<p>(1) He confuses the <emph>original</emph> migration with the later raids. The
Scyths were already in the earlier part of the seventh century settled
south of the Caucasus round Lake Urmiah. It is probable, however,
there were new bands of invaders from the north-east (cf. 104 nn.).
<pb n="106"/></p>
<p>(2) It is probable the Scythian attack on the Medes was not
accidental (<foreign rend="ital">v. i.</foreign>).</p>
<p>(3) He makes too definite the &lsquo;rule of the Scyths&rsquo;; as he himself
says, the &lsquo;28 years&rsquo; (106. 1; iv. 1. 3) included the whole time of their
wanderings.</p>
<p>For these later Scythian raids cf. Zeph. i (circ. 630-620 B. C.);
Jer. i. 13-14, &lsquo;I see a seething pot and its face is towards the
north&rsquo;; and Maspero, iii. 472 seq. Rawlinson (i. 399) quite underestimates 
their importance.</p>
<p>Protothyes is probably the Bartatua of the monuments, to whom
Esarhaddon gave his daughter in marriage. If the Assyrians really
called in the northern barbarians as allies, they paid in the end
dearly for the temporary relief, while the Medes suffered little, as
they were protected by their mountains; it was like the inviting of
Germans by the Sequani (Caes. B. G. i. 31). The name of Madyes,
too, is confirmed by the monuments; Strabo (61) couples him with
Sesostris and others as a leader of <foreign lang="greek">οἱ ἐπὶ πολὺ ἐκτοπισμοί</foreign>.</p></div3></div>

probable estimate. H.'s distances are not actual measurements, but
are only estimates based on the usual time taken for the journeys.
Here, on the Black Sea coast, a great detour would be necessary.</p>
<p>For the Saspeires north-west of Media and south of the modern
Georgia, cf. <ref target="c.3.94" targOrder="U">iii. 94 n.</ref> H.'s words here and in iv. 37 seem to point to
the fact that one of the great roads of the Persian Empire ran from
Ecbatana, past Lake Urmiah, into the upper valley of the Araxes,

the railway runs; probably H. means this second road. Stein,

actual route of part of the invaders, but H. clearly did not know it.</p></div3></div>

<p>The Pasargadae (cf. iv. 167. 1) gave their name to the capital
under Cyrus and Cambyses. It is identified with Murgh&acirc;b, in the
mountains to the north-east of Persepolis. That city was founded
by Darius, as Pasargadae was too out-of-the-way for a capital.
<pb n="110"/>
The name, &lsquo;Persepolis,&rsquo; however, does not occur till Macedonian
times.</p>
<p>For the identification of Pasargadae and Murgh&acirc;b cf. Perrot et
Chipiez, v. 443-5. The view of Oppert, that Pasargadae is to be
placed south-east of Shiraz, is impossible, as it removes the site
too far from Persepolis.</p>
<p>At Murgh&acirc;b is a building known as &lsquo;the tomb of the Mother of
Solomon&rsquo;, which is usually identified with the tomb of Cyrus (for a
defence of this traditional view cf. Curzon, Persia, ii. 74 seq.; for the
tomb itself, P. et C. v. 597-607, with picture). The tomb is in seven
tiers, with a chamber on the top, and answers to the description of
Cyrus' tomb in Arrian (Anab. vi. 29. 4-8). On one of the pillars of
the palace at Murgh&acirc;b is a figure which once bore an inscription,
&lsquo;I am Cyrus the king, the Achaemenian.&rsquo; Difficulties have been
raised as to this figure, because the head-dress is Egyptian, and the
four wings and the fringed garment are usually called Assyrian (cf.
135. In. for Persian borrowing). But E. Herzfeld (Klio, viii. 63-4)
says the dress is Elamite, and so suitable to Cyrus; and Curzon
(<foreign rend="ital">u. s.</foreign>) ingeniously shows that the description of Arrian implies that
the body of Cyrus was buried in Egyptian fashion, i. e. like a
mummy; he refers doubtfully to iii. 2, the story of Nitetis, as
explaining how this could be. The identification, therefore, of the
figure with that of the great Cyrus may be accepted.</p>

<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ἀγάλματα κτλ</lemma>. This passage is accurate in the general sense; there
were no cult-statues in Persia (but <foreign rend="ital">v. i.</foreign>), and the Persians worshipped
in the open air; Dinon, a fourth-century writer (fr. 9, F. H. G. ii. 91),
affirms this, adding <foreign lang="greek">θεῶν ἀγάλματα μόνα τὸ πῦρ καὶ τὸ ὕδωρ νομίζοντες</foreign>,
They had, however, huge altars on the hill-tops (cf. Maspero, iii.
591, for picture of those at Nakhsh-I-Roustem), and there were
<pb n="112"/>
others in temples (cf. further in App. VIII, &sect; 4), on which the everburning 
fire was maintained. H. here gives the strict theory of the
religion, but there were inconsistencies in practice. For a similar
belief and a similar inconsistency in Germany cf. Tac. Germ. c. 9
contrasted with cc. 7, 40; we might add that there is a similar reasonable 
inconsistency in Christianity. H. is on the whole confirmed by
the usage of the Parsees, among whom the word for fire-temple
(D&acirc;dg&acirc;h) seems to mean also the place for any object (e.g. for the
dead or the dog). Spiegel, Avesta, vol. ii, p. lxiv (1859).</p>

was borrowed from Assyria (cf. 135. 1), which perhaps had in turn
borrowed it from the winged sun-orb of Egypt.</p></div3>

himself the firm stones of the heavens (as his robe)&rsquo; (Yasna, 30. 5;
xxxi. 31); &lsquo;the sun and the star are his eyes&rsquo; (ib. 68. 22, p. 324); but
the strict creed had spiritualized him, and distinguished him from
his attributes, cf. Yast 13. 1, 2; xxiii. 180; Ahuramazda speaks,
&lsquo;I maintain that sky, there above, shining and seen afar, and
encompassing this earth all round.&rsquo; But &lsquo;many features, though

<div3 id="c.1.131.3" type="section" n="3">
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">τῇ Οὐρανίῃ</lemma>. This passage is important in three ways:</p>
<p>(1) It illustrates Persian borrowing from foreigners (135. 1); they
had mixed with their dualistic creed many alien elements. The
worship of the Oriental love-goddess Anaitis was combined with the
old Iranian worship of Ardv&icirc; S&ucirc;ra by Artaxerxes Longimanus (465-425) 
(Berosus, fr. 16, F. H. G. ii. 508; he calls him <foreign lang="greek">τοῦ Δαρείου τοῦ
Ὤχου</foreign>, but this must be a mistake). The king set up her statues for
worship in Ecbatana and Susa, though previously the Persians
<foreign lang="greek">ἀγάλματα θεῶν οὐ ξύλα καὶ λίθους ὑπειλήφασιν ὥσπερ Ἕλληνες, οὐδὲ μὴν
ἴβιδας καὶ ἰχνεύμονας, καθάπερ Αἰγύπτιοι, ἀλλὰ πῦρ τε καὶ ὕδωρ ὡς
φιλόσοφοι</foreign>. For the worship of Anaitis, which was especially established 
in Armenia, cf. Strabo, 532. For the quaint story of her
worship in Skye cf. Boswell's Johnson, v. 218 (B. Hill's edition).
For Ardv&icirc; S&ucirc;ra, originally &lsquo;the holy water spring&rsquo;, cf. Yast 5; xxiii.
52 seq.</p>
<p>(2) H. makes a strange mistake in confusing this worship with that
of Mithra, the god of heavenly light, &lsquo;who foremost in golden array
takes hold of the beautiful summits&rsquo; (Yast 10. 4; xxiii. 123).
Mithra, at first only closely connected with the sun, was later
<pb n="113"/>
identified with him (cf. the frequent inscription &lsquo;Deo invicto Soli
Mithrae&rsquo;). His worship became most important in the later
developments of the Persian religion; Artaxerxes II is the first to
invoke him and Anaitis, along with Orrnazd. His feast was a solemn
festival, at which the Persian king was expected to get drunk
(Duris, fr. 13, F. H. G. ii. 473). For Mithraism in Roman times,
when it was a formidable rival to Christianity, cf. Dill, Roman
Society from Nero, pp. 585 seq.; it was the special religion of the
legions (cf. R. Kipling's fine poem in Puck of Pook's Hill). H. seems
to have been misled by the likeness of the names &lsquo;Mylitta&rsquo; and
&lsquo;Mithra&rsquo;, and perhaps by the fact that they were both heavenly
divinities (<foreign rend="ital">v. i.</foreign> for Mylitta).</p>
<p>(3) The passage shows the close connexion of Aphrodite with the
Babylonian Mylitta, the Assyrian Ishtar, the Phoenician Astarte;
whether there was actual borrowing, or whether independent cults
were assimilated, it is impossible to say; probably both were the
case (<foreign rend="ital">v. i.</foreign>). Ishtar was the queen of the gods, at once warrior
goddess and goddess of generation, the destroyer of life and its
renewer. From Assyria her worship spread to Phoenicia (cf. 105.
2 n. for her temple at Ashkelon), and thence to Cyprus (for her temple
at Paphos cf. Tac. Hist. ii. 2-3; 105. 3 n.). Her shrine at Cythera was
founded by Phoenicians (105. 2 n.), and was the oldest in Greece
(cf. her epithet <foreign lang="greek">Κυθέρεια</foreign> in <bibl n="Hom. Od. 8.288">Od. viii. 288</bibl>). For the rites at her
temple in Babylon cf. c. 199 n.; for impure ritual in Greece (at
Corinth only) Strabo, 378, and Athen. 573. She was identified at
once with the evening star, &lsquo;the star of love,&rsquo; and with the moon
(cf. Milton, P. L. i. 439, &lsquo;Astarte, queen of heaven, with crescent
horns&rsquo;); this later identification was probably due to a confusion
with Isis and Hathor, who are represented as supporting on their
horned heads the solar disk; these symbols were mistakenly
interpreted as the crescent and the full moon. That the Greeks
were conscious of the partially foreign origin of Aphrodite is shown
by her epithets <foreign lang="greek">Κύπρις</foreign> (<bibl n="Hom. Il. 5.330">Il. v. 330</bibl>), <foreign lang="greek">Κυπρογενής</foreign> (Hesiod), &amp;c.; for
these cf. <bibl n="Hom. Od. 8.362">Od. viii. 362</bibl>.</p>
<p>There may have been an original native goddess in Greece who
was identified with the Oriental goddess; so at Mycenae are found
naked female figures with hands on breasts, and in some cases with
a dove (cf. Schuchhardt's Schliemann, figs. 180-2), which may well
be independent of direct Oriental influence. The Greeks took over
from the East her title of <foreign lang="greek">Οὐρανία</foreign> without understanding it: hence
they attempted to distinguish Aphrodite O., the goddess of pure love,
from A. <foreign lang="greek">πάνδημος</foreign> (<bibl n="Paus. 9.16.4">Paus. ix. 16. 4</bibl>; cf. Xen. Symp. 8. 9-10 for the
supposed contrast in their worships); but this is a later and artificial 
explanation. (For the evidence cf. Driver, Hastings' Dict.,
s. v. Ashtoreth, and more fully Farnell, C. G. S. ii. 618 seq.)</p>
<p>The name Mylitta is probably the &lsquo;bilit&rsquo; or &lsquo;belit&rsquo; of the Assyrian
inscriptions = &lsquo;lady&rsquo;, i. e. the feminine of Baal or Bel = &lsquo;lord&rsquo;.
<pb n="114"/></p>
<p>Aliat (cf. iii. 8. 3) = Al Il&acirc;t, &lsquo;the goddess.&rsquo; What was originally
a common noun became a proper name; so &lsquo;Astarte&rsquo;, properly an
epithet signifying fruitfulness (Deut. vii. 13), became the name of
a goddess.</p></div3></div>

water (&lsquo;zasthra&rsquo;, S. B. E. iv, p. 69) was sometimes poured (cf.
vii. 54. 2 (Xerxes at the Hellespont), 188. 2 n.); the fillet (<foreign lang="greek">ἐστεφανωμένος</foreign>)

with the burnt offering, as bread goes with meats in a meal (cf. Lev.

wished his countrymen to develop that arm of their forces; hence
Cyrus' supposed development is merely an object-lesson to the

<p>H. is at his weakest as a linguist (cf. explanation of royal names,
vi. 98. 3 n.); yet he seems to have valued himself on this score. He
makes two remarks on Persian names, which are both inaccurate:</p>
<p>(1) That they all have a certain meaning. <foreign lang="greek">σῶμα</foreign> is variously
taken (<foreign rend="ital">a</foreign>) by Stein, in a general sense, &lsquo;individuals (32. 8) and
their honourable nature&rsquo;; (<foreign rend="ital">b</foreign>) by Macaulay, &lsquo;their bodily shape&rsquo;
(which is simpler). Whichever sense be given, H. is too absolute;
nor is he consistent; cf. vi. 98. Some Persian names referred to
deities (cf. Mithradates, &lsquo;given by Mithra&rsquo;); others to personal
appearance (Otanes, &lsquo;fair of body&rsquo;); others (e.g. Darius, &lsquo;possessor&rsquo;)
to position, &amp;c.</p>
<p>(2) That all names end in S. This, in the first place, ignores all
feminine names. Even of men's names, it is only true of the
Greek forms; in Persian, <foreign rend="ital">s</foreign> (sh) was retained after <foreign rend="ital">i</foreign> or <foreign rend="ital">u</foreign>, e.g.
Darayavaush = Darius, but not otherwise, e.g. Vist&acirc;&ccedil;ha (Hystaspes),
where, however, the final <foreign rend="ital">a</foreign> was not written.</p>
<p>For the interesting statement as to the Greek alphabet cf. Roberts,
Gk. Epig. p. 8 seq. The Phoenicians had four signs for sibilants,
each of which was borrowed in part by Greece:</p>
<p>(1) The hard Samech (No. 15 in the Phoenician alphabet; sign &lt;*&gt;),
probably = &lsquo;Sigma&rsquo;. Others, however, make &lsquo;<foreign lang="greek">σίγμα</foreign>&rsquo; (&lsquo;the hissing
letter&rsquo;) a genuine Greek word (from <foreign lang="greek">σίζω</foreign>).</p>
<p>(2) The lingual Tsade (No. 18; sign &lt;*&gt;).</p>
<p>(3) The palatal Shin (No. 21; sign &lt;*&gt;).</p>
<p>(4) There was also the soft Zazin (No. 7; sign &lt;*&gt;).</p>
<p>Of these the name Tsade survives in Zeta, while &lsquo;Samech&rsquo; was
transferred to the place of &lsquo;Shin&rsquo;. The sign of Samech and its
place in the alphabet after &lsquo;N&rsquo;, were left to the later Xi.</p>
<p>For &lsquo;San&rsquo; cf. Pind. fr. 79. H. probably means by &lsquo;San&rsquo; the M of

<p>&lsquo;Ionians&rsquo; was the general name of the Greeks in the East
(for the whole question of the Ionians cf. especially Busolt, i. 277
seq., and Meyer, F. i. 127 seq.); cf. Persian &lsquo;Yauna&rsquo; in the B. I.,

<quote lang="greek">*)iao/nwn gh=n oi)/xetai pe/rsai qe/lwn</quote></cit>. It was this stock that first came in
contact with Orientals. So &lsquo;Frank&rsquo; was used in the East of all
Crusaders. As to the origin of the name &lsquo;Ionian&rsquo;, two views are
held:</p>
<p>(1) That it developed in Asia Minor, and was gradually extended
<pb n="119"/>
to the islands and Attica. &lsquo;The central part of the Aegean formed in
language, commerce, and civilization a closely connected whole,
whose unity found its clearest expression in the great fair at
Delos&rsquo; (Meyer, <foreign rend="ital">u. s.</foreign> 133), though its original home was the Asiatic
mainland.</p>
<p>(2) That it was brought to Asia from Europe by the most
important tribe among the immigrants, which was connected with
part of the population of Attica.</p>
<p>This latter in the main is H.'s view (c. 147), and may be accepted
for the following reasons (see Note F, p. 450):</p>
<p>(<foreign rend="ital">a</foreign>) The four Ionian tribes are found in Attica (v. 66. 2 n.), and are
proved by inscriptions to have existed in Delos and in Teos; as we
have inscriptions also as to them in Cyzicus and in Perinthus, we
may infer their existence in Miletus and in Samos (Busolt, i. 279).</p>
<p>(<foreign rend="ital">b</foreign>) The festival of the Apaturia is found in Athens and in the
Ionic cities of Asia Minor (not in the Orientalized Ephesus and
Colophon (147. 2)). But the Athenian cult of Apollo <foreign lang="greek">πατρῷος</foreign> (in
spite of Plato, Euthyd. 302 C) is not found in Ionia (Farnell, G. C.
iv. 161).</p>
<p>(<foreign rend="ital">c</foreign>) Attica is Ionic very early. Cf. <bibl n="Hom. Il. 13.685">Il. xiii. 685</bibl>, and Solon
(<foreign lang="greek">Ἀθ. Πολ</foreign>. 5) calls it <foreign lang="greek">πρεσβυτάτην γαῖαν Ἰαονίας</foreign>. It was as head of
the Ionians that Athens took part in the Amphictyonic Council.</p>
<p>At the same time it is possible that there was a survival of preIonic 
population in Attica. Ion in the legend comes from abroad
(cf. viii. 44. 2), from the later Achaia, originally called Aegialus (<bibl n="Paus. 7.1.1">Paus.
vii. 1. 1</bibl>; H. vii. 94); Euripides (in the Ion) gives him a native
mother, Creusa. For the strife of races in Attic myth cf. 78. 3 n.
The peculiar feature in Attica, however, is that the two races amalgamated 
before history begins.</p>
<p>As to the first view, viz. that &lsquo;Ionian&rsquo; rose in Asia Minor, three
theories may be briefly mentioned:</p>
<p>(1) Curtius' famous paradox (Die Ionier vor der Ion. Wanderung,
1855) was that the Ionians came into Greece from Asia Minor. This
is accepted by Holm (i. c. 7), but it contradicts all tradition; and the
fact that the Ionians always were confined to the coast points
clearly to their having reached it by sea.</p>
<p>(2) Meyer maintained (<foreign rend="ital">u. s.</foreign> p. 150) that the settlement of Ionia
took place in Mycenaean times. But the almost complete absence
in Ionia of the &lsquo;stirrup vases&rsquo; and of the gems, so characteristic of
Mycenaean civilization, is against this (Busolt, i. 277 n.).</p>
<p>(3) Bury (E. H. R. 1900, p. 288 seq.) thinks the name &lsquo;Ionian&rsquo;
was borrowed by immigrants from a pre-Greek population in Asia
Minor; cf. the possible identification of the &lsquo;Yaunna&rsquo;, allies of the
Hittites against Rameses II in the thirteenth century B.C. (App.
x. 8), with &lsquo;Ionians&rsquo;. But there is no sufficient evidence for this view.</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">καλλίστῳ</lemma>. Cf. the view in <bibl n="Aristot. Pol. 7.1327b">Arist. Pol. vii. 7. 2-3, 1327 b</bibl> that the
Greek race owed to equable climate the fact that it was at once
<pb n="120"/>
<foreign lang="greek">ἔνθυμον</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">διανοητικόν</foreign>, a mean between the reckless Northerners
and the cowardly Easterns. Hippocrates (de Aer. 12) claims for
Asia <foreign lang="greek">παντὸς ἰσομοιρίη</foreign> in natural advantages. The <foreign lang="greek">κρῆσις τῶν ὠρέων</foreign>
gives <foreign lang="greek">μετριότης</foreign>; but he goes on to admit that courage and endurance
cannot be expected in a region so favoured.</p></div3>

<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">τρόπους τέσσερας</lemma>. H. is probably more trustworthy in his linguistic

<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ἀσθενέστατον</lemma>. H. is accused of anti-Ionian bias (cf. v. 69. 1; vi. 13.

limits his statement here to the second half of the sixth century
(<foreign lang="greek">τότε</foreign>), of which it is true, if we except Samos; the greatness of Miletus
in trade and in politics was already largely a thing of the past.</p>
<p>Meyer (F. i. 129 seq.) denies that in the fifth century there was
any inferiority attached to the name &lsquo;Ionian&rsquo;; he says (p. 131)
that H. is simply trying to explain why the Athenians, who are the
representatives of the Ionian <emph>race</emph> (cf. Solon in <foreign lang="greek">Ἀθ. Πολ</foreign>. quoted on
c. 142), are never called so as a <foreign rend="ital">people.</foreign> It is clear, however, that
there was some contempt in &lsquo;Ionians&rsquo; in the fifth century [cf. iv.
142; <bibl n="Thuc. 5.9.1">Thuc. v. 9. 1</bibl> (Brasidas), vi. 77. 1 (Hermocrates), viii. 25. 5,
with Hauvette, R. E. G. 1888, 257 seq.], no doubt because, as
Hermocrates says, they had been subject to barbarians, and
because of their increasing Oriental admixture; so the Ionian
dress is imposed on the Athenian ladies as a punishment (v. 87. 3).
The name too was being specialized for the inhabitants of the
Lydian and north Carian seaboard [cf. the &lsquo;Ionian&rsquo; circle in the
Athenian Empire, and the inscription as to Tanagra (<bibl n="Paus. 5.10.4">Paus. v. 10. 4</bibl>),
which distinguishes Athenians from Ionians.</p>
<p>Athens was playing a double and inconsistent part; on the one
hand she was championing Ionism (ix. 106. 3; <bibl n="Thuc. 3.86.3">Thuc. iii. 86. 3-4</bibl>,
vi. 82); on the other she was enslaving her Ionian kinsmen; but
it must be remembered that the Ionic Apaturia was always celebrated 
at Athens (c. 147. 2 n.), and that the Athenians retained the
&lsquo;Ionic&rsquo; tribes, at least for religious purposes.</p></div3></div>

<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">διὰ ταύτην τὴν αἰτίην</lemma>. H. no doubt tells the Halicarnassian story.
At best it was an occasion, not the cause of exclusion, which was
no doubt due to the Carian and Ionian admixture at Halicarnassus.
(Cf. Hicks, p. 41, and Introd. p. 2.) That town was the furthest
point to the north of Dorian colonization, which crossed the Aegean
by way of Crete, probably in the tenth century, and spread up the
coast till it met the tide of Ionic migration.</p>
<p>Lindus, Ialysus, and Camirus were the three cities in Rhodes,

<div id="c.1.145" type="chapter" n="145">
<p>Here as elsewhere (cf. 56. 3 n.) H. accepts the usual tradition
of the Dorian migration and its results. That the colonization of
Ionia was connected with that early &lsquo;wandering of the nations&rsquo;
is probable; that it took place all at once, as H. implies, is most
unlikely. Whether any great mass of the colonists came from the
north of Peloponnese, as is stated here and also by Strabo (383,
though with variations), is very uncertain.</p>
<p>The arguments for this last point are (1) the common number,
twelve states; (2) the supposed connexion of Poseidon of Helice
(<bibl n="Hom. Il. 8.203">Il. viii. 203</bibl>) with P. Heliconius (but see 148 n.); (3) the fact that Attica
is a very natural pier of embarcation for dispossessed tribes. On the
other hand, (1) and (2) may well have led to the invention of the tradition; 
and the noble genealogies of Ionia were traced back to Pylos
(Strabo, 634, quoting Mimnermus) and not to Athens. This last
point, however, is consistent with the tradition, which made Melanthus 
of Pylos king at Athens. On the whole, the balance of probability 
is for the traditional view, but it is possible that there was
direct emigration from Argolis to Ionia: cf. the prominence of

Probably the reference is to some forgotten story, connecting
Dodona (cf. <bibl n="Aesch. PB 829">Aesch. P. V. 829</bibl>) with the migration to the East.
Pausanias (vii. 4. 2) makes Ionians from Epidaurus (not Dorians)
settle in Samos. The <foreign lang="greek">ἄλλα ἔθνεα</foreign> are probably not Lydians and

fact that Phocaea was founded by a part of the Phocians, who left
their home by a voluntary migration, not from external compulsion;
in this it resembled the later colonies, and not its contemporary
foundations. The Arcadians are called &lsquo;Pelasgi&rsquo;, because they were

directed against Ionian pride of birth; even the purest-blooded of
them had foreign wives and foreign rulers (147. 1); but the claims

<p>Pausanias (vii. 2. 6) tells the same tale shortly. H. here seems
to be incorporating in his argument a piece of very early custom.
Among some savage tribes, e.g. the Caribs in North America, the
wife neither eats with the husband nor calls him by his name
(cf. Frazer, iv. 116). The myth of Cupid and Psyche preserves in
a curious form this primitive separation of husband and wife.
There may have been some strange survival of this at Miletus, but
it can hardly have been as absolute as H. states.</p></div3></div>

settlers and native princes.</p>
<p>For the Pylian families at Athens cf. Busolt, i. 287, n. 3, who
thinks (following T&ouml;ppfer, Att. Geneal. 225 seq.) that the story of
their migration to Asia <foreign rend="ital">via</foreign> Attica is an Athenian invention; he
argues that Peloponnesian wanderers would have gone directly by

the family had again migrated. For Pylians at Athens cf. v. 65. 3,

of government in the eighth century or even later (cf. Busolt, ii. 455,
n. 6, for its disappearance), and authority passed into the hands of
an oligarchy claiming descent from the founder. Strabo (633) says
that even in his own day the Codridae at Ephesus were called
&lsquo;kings&rsquo; and had honorary privileges.</p></div3>

<p>The Apaturia (see T&ouml;ppfer in P.-W. <foreign rend="ital">s. v.</foreign>) was the festival (in
the month Pyanepsion) of the Phratries at Athens, at which new
members were enrolled; cf. Schol. Aristoph. Ach. 146, where its
three days are described, and <bibl n="Xen. Hell. 1.7.8">Xen. Hell. i. 7. 8</bibl> (its fatal influence on
the trial of the generals in 406 B.C.). Various deities were connected
with it, especially Zeus Phratrios and Athena Phratria. The derivation
from the <foreign lang="greek">ἀπάτη</foreign> of Melanthus is an etymological legend; it really =
<foreign lang="greek">ὁμοπατόρια</foreign>, the gathering of &lsquo;fathers&rsquo; (cf. <foreign lang="greek">ἄκοιτις</foreign>). We can trace the
festival widely, e.g. in the Aegean, at Cyzicus, and at Olbia; but the
only inscription found as to it comes from the Crimea (? Phanagoria),
I. G. A. 350.</p>
<p>No doubt the cause of the absence of the Apaturia at Ephesus was
the Orientalized character of that city; it was divided into five tribes,
which are independent of the four Ionic tribes (c. 142 n.), except that
one of its five had a sub-division &lsquo;Argadis&rsquo;. Its worship of Artemis
too was full of Eastern elements (cf. Strabo, 641). So Ephesus takes
little part in Ionic revolt (vi. 8 n.; 16. 2).</p>

<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">Ἑλικώνιος</lemma> would naturally mean &lsquo;of Helicon&rsquo;, and Farnell (C. G. S.

in contact with the Minyae. There was a <foreign lang="greek">Ἵππου κρήνη</foreign>, a fountain of
the Poseidon horse, Pegasus, near its top (<bibl n="Paus. 9.31.3">Paus. ix. 31. 3</bibl>). If
Farnell's view is right, the worship of Poseidon at Helice in Achaia

Thucydides (iii. 104) pointedly ignores this festival when he speaks

<p>For the Aeolian migration cf. Busolt, i. 272 seq. It was tradition<pb n="124"/>
ally four generations earlier than the Ionian (Strabo, 582), and like
it was connected with the Dorian invasion. It was, however, an
even more gradual movement, and neither in conduct nor in results
had it the unity which is attributed (no doubt in exaggeration) to the
Ionian migration. There is no reason to doubt the tradition that connects 
the Aeolians especially with Thessaly and Boeotia (<bibl n="Thuc. 3.2.3">Thuc. iii.
2. 3</bibl>; vii. 57. 5; viii. 5. 2, 100. 3); this is supported by the likeness

<foreign lang="greek">πίνω</foreign>, feminine endings in <foreign lang="greek">ις</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">ω</foreign>; Busolt, i. 195, n. 2). The name
Aeolis is used in four senses:</p>
<p>(1) A district in south-west Thessaly (Apoll. i. 7. 3; F. H. G.

<p>(4) All the settlements in the northern half of the west coast of
Asia Minor, about thirty in number. Cyme and Lesbos were the
<foreign lang="greek">μητροπόλεις</foreign> (Strabo, 622).</p>
<p>The name &lsquo;Aeolian&rsquo; (first used in Hes. W. and D. 636&mdash;of Cyme)
perhaps arose in Asia Minor, and was transferred back to Greece proper; 
it seems to be used of all &lsquo;colonies&rsquo; which were neither Dorian nor
Ionian. The name may be connected with <foreign lang="greek">αἰόλος</foreign>, &lsquo;glancing, changeful.&rsquo;</p>

ship-of-war in the sixth century, although Thucydides (i. 13. 2-3)
says that the Corinthians were building triremes by 700 B.C. (this
is his meaning, in spite of Torr, A. S. p. 4, n. 8). The Samian
and the Phocaean navies were mainly composed of penteconters;
they had, however, a few triremes (<bibl n="Thuc. 1.14.1">Thuc. i. 14. 1</bibl>). H.'s details as
to Samos (contrast iii. 39. 3 and 44. 2) confirm this view, that the
navies of the period were mixed. Thucydides further seems to
suggest that large fleets of triremes were first formed in Sicily and at
Corcyra. The lighter penteconter would be used in preference for
a long voyage or for a piratical raid. In the penteconter there were
twenty-five oars a side; but the principle of superimposed banks may
<pb n="128"/>
be as old as the Homeric Catalogue (<bibl n="Hom. Il. 2.510">Il. ii. 510</bibl>&mdash;the Boeotian ships
have 120 men each; cf. <bibl n="Thuc. 1.10.4">Thuc. i. 10. 4</bibl>). For its use in Phoenician
warships as early as 700 B.C. cf. Torr, p. 4, and figs. 10 and 11.</p></div3>

wisdom for which he was ranked among the Seven Sages (27. 2 n.);
he alone of these was also a philosopher. His proposal was to
secure united action by a genuine federal government (cf. Freeman,

<div3 id="c.1.171.1" type="section" n="1">
<p>Of the Carians and Leleges may well be quoted the words of
Strabo (322), when, after describing the wide diffusion of the Leleges,
he says (speaking of north-west Greece): &lsquo;Now that most of the
land has become desolate, and the settlements and especially the
cities have disappeared, even if a man could give a definite account,
he would do nothing useful, owing to the uncertainty (<foreign lang="greek">ἀδοξία</foreign>) and
to the fact that the peoples have disappeared, a movement which
began long since.&rsquo; The best English accounts are those of Myres
and Paton, J. H. S. xvi. 264 seq., and (of the Leleges) of Holm,
i. 63-4, 72. The following are the most important points as to the
two races:</p>
<p><hi rend="bold">I. In Asia Minor.</hi></p>
<p>(1) In Homer (<bibl n="Hom. Il. 10.428">Il. x. 428-9</bibl>) Dolon places them both with the
Lycians, Mysians, and Phrygians among the allies of Troy. In the
Catalogue (ii. 867) the Carians are <foreign lang="greek">βαρβαρόφωνοι</foreign>, and inhabit Miletus.</p>
<p>(2) Leleges are placed by Homer at Pedasus in the Troad (<bibl n="Hom. Il. 21.86-7">Il. xxi.
86-7</bibl>), but do not occur in &lsquo;the Catalogue&rsquo;.</p>
<p>(3) Strabo (321, 611) tells us that ancient &lsquo;tombs and forts&rsquo; in
Caria were called &lsquo;Lelegian&rsquo;.</p>
<p>(4) Philippus, a Carian writer of the third century B. C., makes
the Leleges serfs of the Carians; Plutarch (Qu. Gr. 46; Mor. 302)
says that the survivors of the Leleges were serfs at Tralles.</p>
<p>We may conclude they were genuine tribes on the Anatolian
coast, of whom the Carians were the later comers and the
conquerors. The two races were often identified, especially as the
<pb n="131"/>
Carians seem to have adopted the speech of their subjects; for two
races in Caria cf. 171. 6.</p>
<p><hi rend="bold">II. In Greece proper.</hi></p>
<p>(1) Carians are traced at Megara (citadel called &lsquo;Caria&rsquo;, <bibl n="Paus. 1.40.6">Paus.
i. 40. 6</bibl>), in the Argolid at Epidaurus and Hermione (Strabo, 374,
quoting Aristotle), at Athens (Isagoras, H. v. 66. 1). But the last
instance proves nothing, and the first may be connected with the
later military importance of the Carians.</p>
<p>(2) Leleges are mentioned continually as early inhabitants, e.g. by
Strabo, 321-2 (quoting Arist.), in Acarnania, Aetolia, Boeotia, &amp;c.
This is probably invention based (<foreign rend="ital">a</foreign>) on the fact that the Leleges,
like the Pelasgians, are merely a prehistoric stop-gap; where
nothing was known they were put in; (<foreign rend="ital">b</foreign>) on resemblances of placenames 
in Caria and in central Greece (Busolt, i. 185. 4 n.), e.g. Abae
in Caria and in Phocis.</p>
<p>We may conclude that there is no sufficient evidence for the
presence of Carians and Leleges in Greece proper.</p>
<p>III. But it is not unlikely that the primitive population of Greece
and of Anatolia was really akin; we find place-names ending in
-<foreign lang="greek">νθος</foreign>, -<foreign rend="ital">nda</foreign> (and perhaps -<foreign lang="greek">ασσος, -ασα</foreign>) common to both regions, and
a number of words &lsquo;earthy of the soil&rsquo;, e.g. <foreign lang="greek">βόλινθος</foreign>, with a similar
termination (cf. Conway's list, B. S. A. viii. 155). We may also
compare the primitive cist-graves of Assarlik in Caria with the
pre-Mycenaean graves in the Cyclades. So the double axe was a
symbol of the Carians, but perhaps they and the Cretans borrowed
it equally from some earlier people. (For this view generally cf.
Mackenzie, B. S. A. xii, p. 217 seq.) The double axe seems to be
the symbol also of the Hittite god, Tesub.</p>
<p><hi rend="bold">IV. The races in the islands.</hi></p>
<p>Greek theory made the Carians native in the islands (171. 2;
<bibl n="Thuc. 1.4.1">Thuc. i. 4. 1</bibl>, 8. 1, though with differing details). Thucydides
seeks to confirm this by archaeological evidence; but the weapons
found in the island-graves do not resemble the Carian weapons
of c. 171. Probably, therefore, the native tradition is right (171. 5),
that they were originally a mainland people, and the Greek tradition 
is a mere inference from the Thalassocracy of Minos. There
were Carians in the islands, however, in the ninth and eighth
centuries (<foreign rend="ital">v. i.</foreign>).</p>
<p>V. The theory once maintained that the Carians were the authors
of the Mycenaean culture (e.g. by K&ouml;hler and D&uuml;mmler) must be
abandoned, in view of the facts that hardly any Mycenaean remains
are found in Caria, and those found show the culture in its decadence
(J. H. S. xvi. 265).</p>
<p>VI. For the affinities of the Carians with the Indo-European
races cf. App. I, &sect; 4. The Carians seem to have been the advanced
guard of the tribes that invaded Anatolia from the north at the end
of the second millennium B. C. Conway (<foreign rend="ital">u. s.</foreign> 156) thinks the Carian
<pb n="132"/>
names may belong to the Indo-European family of speech. If this
be denied (with Kretschmer), we may suppose the conquerors
adopted the language of the conquered earlier population.</p>
<p>It is to this later conquering element we must attribute: (1) The
Carian Thalassocracy (Myres, J. H. S. xxvi. 107-9). There were
Carians in the islands at the time of the Greek settlement (171. 5).
(2) The characteristic Carian weapons (171. 4 n.). (3) The Carian
mercenaries of the seventh century (ii. 152. 5).</p></div3>
<div3 id="c.1.171.4" type="section" n="4">
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">τριξὰ ἐξευρήματα</lemma>. This passage is of great importance for our
knowledge of Greek armour. The difference between the weapons
of Homeric and those of later times is well known; H. here
attributes three changes to the Carians, who were prominent as
mercenaries in the seventh and sixth centuries (cf. Helbig, Hom.
Ep., p. 344; Archil. fr. 24; and ii. 152, 154, v. 111. 1). The statement 
is repeated by Strabo (661), who says (662) the Carians <foreign lang="greek">καθ’ ὅλην
ἐπλανήθησαν τὴν Ἑλλάδα, μισθοῦ στρατεύοντες</foreign>. Pliny (<bibl n="Plin. Nat. 7.56">N. H. vii. 200</bibl>)
also credits the Carians with greaves. H. has grasped the difference
between the huge body-covering shield (<foreign lang="greek">ἠύτε πύργος</foreign>) [Lang, Homer
and his Age, 110 f. compares the shields in the Bayeux Tapestry
and refutes the theory that they were only used in a chariot] and
the round shield of manageable size, borne on the left arm. Some
(e.g. Tsountas, p. 193) think he is wrong as to the &lsquo;badges&rsquo;, and
refer to the &lsquo;stars&rsquo; on Mycenaean shields and the well-known shield
of Achilles of Il. 18. Curtius, however (Ges. Abh. ii. 89), accepts
the statement of H., who is probably referring to some particular
form of badge, which was specially Carian.</p>
<p>With regard to <foreign lang="greek">λόφος</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">ὄχανον</foreign> Strabo (661) quotes from Alcaeus
<foreign lang="greek">λόφον σείων Καρικόν</foreign>, and from Anacreon, <foreign lang="greek">Καρικοεργὲς ὄχανον</foreign>.</p>
<p>The <foreign lang="greek">λόφος</foreign> is frequent in Homer (<bibl n="Hom. Il. 6.469">Il. vi. 469</bibl>, Hector's boy <foreign lang="greek">ἐκλίνθη . . .
ταρβήσας χαλκόν τε ἰδε λόφον ἱππιοχαίτην</foreign>), as H. must have known.
Hence he may be referring to the later form of crest which fits right
on the helmet, as opposed to the earlier form which was raised on
a <foreign lang="greek">κύμβαχος</foreign> (<bibl n="Hom. Il. 15.536">Il. xv. 536</bibl>); the two forms of crests are seen in the
Euphorbus plate (Brunn, Griech. Kunstg. (1893), fig. 114). With the
later form comes in the more frequent use of cheek-pieces to the helmet, 
which, by hiding the face, would make &lsquo;badges&rsquo; more necessary.</p>
<p>The <foreign lang="greek">ὄχανον</foreign> (or <foreign lang="greek">ὀχάνη</foreign>) is used by the Schardana on the Egyptian
monuments of the thirteenth century (Helbig, Hom. Ep., fig. 124, at
Ipsambul); the &lsquo;shield-band&rsquo;, therefore, may have been borrowed by
the Carians from an earlier Anatolian race. The &lsquo;band&rsquo; (of metal,
wood, or leather) was placed across the diameter of the shield from
rim to rim (cf. picture in D. of A., s. v. &lsquo;Clipeus&rsquo;); the shield also
had a grip (<foreign lang="greek">πόρπαξ</foreign>) of leather running round inside the rim.
Hence <foreign lang="greek">πόρπαξ</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">ὄχανον</foreign> are used as convertible (Schol. to Arist.
Eq. 849). They were, however, properly distinct; the conservative 
Spartans used only the <foreign lang="greek">πόρπαξ</foreign> till the third century (<bibl n="Plut. Cleom. 11">Plut.
Cleom. 11</bibl>).
<pb n="133"/></p>
<p>The <foreign lang="greek">ὄχανα</foreign> may be the Homeric <foreign lang="greek">κανόνες</foreign> (<bibl n="Hom. Il. 13.407">Il. xiii. 407</bibl>; Helb.,
pp. 324-57), but it is more probable these latter are the <foreign lang="greek">ῥάβδοι</foreign> of
Hesych. (s. v.), the stiffening rods in the centre of the leather shield.
Cf. Leaf, Iliad, vol. i, App. B, for this and other points as to
Homeric armour.</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">περικείμενοι</lemma>. We have a shield hung from the left shoulder (cf. <cit><bibl n="Hom. Il. 16.106">Il.
xvi. 106</bibl> <quote lang="greek">o( d' a)ristero\n w)=mon e)/kamnen &verbar; e)/mpedon ai)e\n e)/xwn sa/kos</quote></cit>) represented 
in the famous hunting scene on the dagger-blade from the
fourth grave at Mycenae (Helbig, fig. 125); Reichel (Hom. Waff.,
p. 10) elaborately explains the working of the shield. In <bibl n="Hom. Il. 5.795">Il. v. 795-7</bibl>
(cf. <bibl n="Hom. Il. 5.98">Il. v. 98</bibl>), however, Diomede has his shield <foreign lang="greek">τελαμών</foreign> on his right
shoulder.</p>
<p>This early shield also had a &lsquo;grip&rsquo;, which H. takes for granted;
this omission hardly justifies Helbig's criticism, &lsquo;H. either did not
understand the old use or has expressed himself obscurely&rsquo; (p. 323).</p>
<p>To <foreign lang="greek">περικείμενοι</foreign> supply <foreign lang="greek">τελαμῶνας</foreign>. The reason for placing the
&lsquo;shield belt&rsquo; on the left shoulder was that the sword belt had to be
on the right one (<bibl n="Hom. Il. 14.404">Il. xiv. 404-5</bibl>), as the sword itself was on the left

<p>The Lycians are as great a racial and linguistic puzzle as the
Carians. Their language is usually thought to be Indo-European,
on account of the resemblance of its inflexions to those of Greek;
but it has not yet been satisfactorily explained, and its connexion
with Greek is very doubtful, Meyer i. 476.</p>
<p>The name &lsquo;Lycian&rsquo; may be explained: (1) As that of a conquered 
Anatolian tribe. Cf. the Luka of the great Egyptian invasions 
(App. X. 8), and the sea-roving Lukki of the Tell El-Amarna
Tablets. (2) Or, more probably, as a Greek name derived from a
confusion of Apollo <foreign lang="greek">Λύκειος</foreign> (the wolf god) with the deity of Patara
(Farnell, G. C. iv. 113). The geographical position of the Lycians
on the sea-coasts seems to confirm the tradition of their origin as
immigrants <foreign lang="greek">ἐκ Κρήτης</foreign>. They borrowed much from Greece, includ<pb n="134"/>
ing partially their alphabet, but retained their nationality and
political individuality (for the Lycian League cf. Freeman, F. G.
p. 208 seq.). Their abundant coinage is evidence of great prosperity

<p>Milyas (iii. 90. 1) is in historic times the high ground north-east
of Lycia, as far as Pisidia (Strabo, 631). As no Lycian remains are
found here, it was inhabited probably by a distinct people (cf.

be based on various ideas, e.g. the fact that &lsquo;paternity is a matter
of inference, maternity of observation&rsquo; (Maine), on the closer connexion

polygamy. It is confirmed for Lycia by <bibl n="Hom. Il. 6.196-206">Il. vi. 196-206</bibl>; Sarpedon,

This is against the order of names in 153. 4, and also against
probability (cf. also 190. 1 n.); the passage here obviously gives no
chronological evidence. That Cyrus, however, extended his rule
to the Jaxartes is likely in itself, and is confirmed by the list of
satrapies in the B. I. (App. VII, &sect; 1). It is confirmed too by the

<p>For ancient Babylon the main authority is the East India House
inscription of Nebuchadnezzar, 619 lines long (quoted as E. I. H.
from R. P.<hi rend="sup">2</hi> iii. 104 seq.). The best English account is that of
Pinches, in the Enc. Bib. (s. v. Babylon). H. is our oldest Greek
witness; Sayce (Introd. p. 28 seq.) denies that he ever visited
<pb n="136"/>
Babylonia, but this view has not been generally accepted. Cf.
Baumstark in P. W. (about 1896) s. v. Babylon, &lsquo;that [H.'s statements] 
really rest on his own observation, should never have been
disputed. But it is also indisputable that in them what the writer
has himself seen and what he was told by his oriental guides, is
mixed up in a suspicious way&rsquo; (ii. 2689). F. H. Weissbach, however, 
Das Stadtbild von Babylon (1904, Der Alte Orient V), produces 
a plan of Babylon based on recent German excavations (still
going on), which differs entirely from the account of H. or of any
other Greek writer; Weissbach (p. 15) indeed claims the support
of Berosus, who says (F. H. G. ii. 507) that Nebuchadnezzar <foreign lang="greek">ὑπερεβάλετο 
τρεῖς μὲν τῆς ἔνδον πόλεως περιβόλους, τρεῖς δὲ τῆς ἔξω</foreign>, but
there is no trace of <foreign lang="greek">περίβολοι</foreign> on W.'s plan. This plan, not to

Minaean inscriptions (from South Arabia, which go back to ninth
century B. C.). Hence in his <foreign lang="greek">Ἀσσύριοι λόγοι</foreign> (cf. App. II, &sect; 6) H. includes 
both the Assyrian and the Babylonian Empire (cc. 106,
184). The confusion was natural, owing to (1) H.'s ignorance,
especially of Assyria. (2) The identity of their religion and culture.
(3) The fact that Babylon was often a vassal of Nineveh. But the

<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">εἴκοσι καὶ ἑκατόν</lemma>. There are four main questions as to the walls
of Babylon:</p>
<p><hi rend="bold">I. Are the two walls, outer and inner, mentioned by H., the
Imgur Bel and Nimitti Bel of E. I. H. viii. 43-6?</hi> Their identity
is accepted by Baumstark (<foreign rend="ital">u. s.</foreign>), Maspero (iii. 563), and others,
but denied by the recent excavators, e. g. Weissbach (p. 12). This
point does not affect H.'s narrative.</p>
<p><hi rend="bold">II. Had H. seen either or both walls?</hi></p>
<p>(1) Berosus (F. H. G. ii. 508) says that Cyrus &lsquo;arranged to
destroy the outer walls&rsquo;, because Babylon was &lsquo;troublesome and
<pb n="137"/>
hard to take&rsquo;. But this statement seems inconsistent with the
fact that he entered the city peaceably as a deliverer (App.
IV, &sect; 1).</p>
<p>(2) H. himself says (iii. 159. 1) that Darius <foreign lang="greek">τὸ τεῖχος περιεῖλε καὶ
τὰς πύλας πάσας ἀπέσπασε</foreign>. This is usually explained as referring
to the outer wall, and meaning that this had ceased to exist before
H.'s visit. H. then either would be describing the outer wall from
hearsay (Baumstark), or (as Lehmann, Klio, i. 274; cf. H. iii. 150. 1 n.)
incorporating whole passages from Hecataeus (cf. the tenses of
<foreign lang="greek">ἐνεστᾶσι</foreign> 179. 3, and <foreign lang="greek">κεῖται</foreign> 181. 5). But there is no good evidence
that Hecataeus had ever been in Babylon, or that H. copied him
(Introd. &sect; 20), and either alternative seriously prejudices the credit
of H.</p>
<p>(3) It is more natural to suppose, as the words <foreign lang="greek">πύλας ... ἀπέσπασε</foreign>
in fact imply, that Darius simply dismantled the outer wall. He
left Babylon in the state which Scott (in Quentin Durward)
describes at Li&eacute;ge. To remove such enormous masses of brickwork 
entirely would have been at once difficult and needless.
H. throws in touches which rest mainly on hearsay (e. g. 179. 3,
the presence of the &lsquo;brazen&rsquo; gates), but he had seen enough of the
wall to warrant him describing it as existing.</p>
<p><hi rend="bold">III. The extent of the walls.</hi></p>
<p>(1) H.'s figure of 480 stades is supported by the statement of
Philostratus, supposed to be derived from Hellanicus (see P. W.
ii. 2693).</p>
<p>Oppert's attempt to trace the line of this great square on the
modern site is now given up; Weissbach (p. 30) says it is fifty
times too big; but Nikel [Herodot und die Keilschriftforschung
(1896), pp. 25-7] points out that the extent of the ruins (roughly
fifteen miles by twelve) corresponds to H.'s figures, which are
accepted by Baumstark and Lehmann (<foreign rend="ital">u. s.</foreign>). If this is right, the
outer wall included the neighbouring town of Borsippa (cf. 181. 2 n.),
which had also a wall of its own. Many, however, maintain Borsippa 
was quite separate from Babylon, following Berosus (F. H. G.
ii. 508). The recent excavations render somewhat doubtful the
enormous size of Babylon; but as Lehmann points out (<foreign rend="ital">u. s.</foreign>), even
if their results were more certain than they are, the literary tradition 
is very strong, and walls of brick might disappear, leaving
little or no trace (cf. 179. 1 n.).</p>
<p>(2) The figures of other Greek writers are smaller, e.g. Ctesias
(Ass. fr. 5, p. 397) gives 360 stades, Strabo (738) 365 stades,
Cleitarchus (in <bibl n="Diod. 2.7">Diod. ii. 7</bibl>; he was one of the historians of Alexander)
the same; B&auml;hr (Ctesias, pp. 401-4) collects all the evidence. These
are taken as being the extent of the inner wall, which (Abydenus,
F. H. G. iv. 284) lasted down to the time of Alexander.</p>
<p>Of course all this vast area was not inhabited. At any rate
H. is only giving the estimate he had received; he could not have
<pb n="138"/>
measured even one side (contrast ii. 127. 1). For the size of Babylon
cf. <cit><bibl n="Aristot. Pol. 3.1276a">Arist. Pol. iii. 3. 5 (1276 A)</bibl> <quote lang="greek">h(/tis e)/xei perigrafh\n ma=llon e)/qnous h)\

th=s po/lews</quote></cit>.</p>
<p><hi rend="bold">IV. The height of the walls.</hi></p>
<p>H.'s estimate, about 335 feet by 85, to some extent agrees with
that of Ctesias, who gives 50 fathoms (i.e. 300 feet, <bibl n="Diod. 2.7">Diod. ii. 7</bibl>).
Nebuchadnezzar describes his wall as &lsquo;mountains high&rsquo; (E. I. H.
viii. 51; cf. Jer. li. 53), and Xenophon makes the ruined wall of
Nineveh (with its base, <foreign lang="greek">κρηπίς</foreign>) 150 feet high and 50 feet wide
(Anab. iii. 4. 10-11; perhaps he is including the mound on which
it stood). Strabo (738, with whom <bibl n="Diod. 2.7">Diod. ii. 7</bibl> and Q. Curt. v. 1
agree), however, makes the wall of Babylon only 32 feet thick and
75 high (90 in the towers). H. probably follows the exaggerated
figures of his guide. Maspero (iii. 563), who gives a picture of
a conjectural restoration, makes the height of Nimitti Bel, the main
wall, 30 metres, i. e. not quite 100 feet), and says it &lsquo;resembled
rather a chain of mountains with battlements and towers than a
boulevard of man's handiwork&rsquo;. H.'s wall is not broad enough
for stability in proportion to its height, and it is possible that he
even underestimated its thickness; that of Khorsabad, which is
much lower, is nearly 80 feet thick.</p>
<p>He is quite right in saying that there was a walled ditch (178. 3;
179. 2) in front of the outer wall, and that inside there was a second
wall &lsquo;of less extent&rsquo; (181. 1 <foreign lang="greek">στεινότερον</foreign>). For the walls generally
cf. E. I. H. col. 8. To sum up, it may be said that H. gives a
striking impressionist picture of this great scheme of fortification,
but that it is incorrect in details.</p>

<p>For the &lsquo;royal&rsquo; and the &lsquo;ordinary cubit&rsquo; cf. F. Hultsch, Metrologie 
(1882), especially pp. 46, 388. H. illustrates the Oriental
measures from the Greek; but to us the process is reversed, as we
know the Oriental measures, from measurements of Babylonian
bricks and buildings, better than the Greek. The &lsquo;royal cubit&rsquo;
(which was practically the same as the Egyptian royal cubit,
though a fraction longer, ib. p. 552) is calculated at from 532 (or
533) to 525 millimetres; the Greek cubit, therefore, being in the
relation of 8 to 9 (the &lsquo;finger&rsquo; is 7/10 of an inch), was from 473 to
466.6 millimetres. Stein, however, says the relation is 7 to 8, not
8 to 9, basing this on the length of the Attic ell, i. e. 462 millimetres. 
The Samian cubit was the same as the Egyptian ell
(ii. 168. 1); of this there were two kinds, the &lsquo;royal&rsquo;, about 527 millimetres 
(Hultsch, p. 355), the smaller about 450. That the Samian
corresponded to the former, i. e. the longer ell, has been finally
proved by the measurements at the Samian Heraeum (ib. p. 551).

<p>Babylonia, owing to the absence of building stone, was the
special home of brick-work. Crude bricks were used inside the

inferior in hardness to Roman, and to good modern, brick. Hence
the wall was liable to be destroyed by water (cf. the tradition

<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">τὰ βασιλήια</lemma>. The question of the palaces and temples of Babylon
is one of the most disputed in H. The following facts may be taken
as fairly certain:</p>
<p>(1) That there were three palaces: (<foreign rend="ital">a</foreign>) That on the right bank
built by Nebuchadnezzar, in which Alexander died. (<foreign lang="greek">τὰ πέραν
βασίλεια</foreign>, <bibl n="Plut. Alex. 76">Plut. Alex. 76</bibl>; Arr. Anab. vii. 25. These authorities are
specially important as quoting <foreign lang="greek">αἱ βασίλειοι ἐφημερίδες</foreign> as to
Alexander's last days.) (<foreign rend="ital">b</foreign>) That on the left bank, close to the
temple of Merodach (cf. E. I. H. viii. 31 seq.). (<foreign rend="ital">c</foreign>) Another built by
Nebuchadnezzar to the north. As this was built in fifteen days
(E. I. H. cols. 8 and 9, and Berosus, F. H. G. ii. 507) it was less
important.</p>
<p>(2) That there were two pre-eminent temples, that of Bel Merodach 
or Marduk in Babylon proper, on the left bank of the river
(the &lsquo;Esagila&rsquo;), and that of Bel Nebo in Borsippa, on the right bank
of the river (the &lsquo;Ezida&rsquo;).</p>
<p>(3) That one palace (viz. 1 <foreign rend="ital">b</foreign> above) has been proved to be identical
with the mound of El Qasr, and the &lsquo;Esagila&rsquo; temple (less certainly)
with Tell Amran.</p>
<p>(4) That Xerxes destroyed the great temple of Bel-Marduk in
the centre of Babylon (Arr. Anab. vii. 17. 2); Strabo (738) calls it
<foreign lang="greek">ὁ τοῦ Βήλου τάφος</foreign>, but this is obviously the terraced tower, the
ziggurat, the most important part of the Esagila.</p>
<p>There are, the, two main difficulties in the account of H.:</p>
<p>(1) He mentions only <emph>one</emph> palace and <emph>one</emph> temple, although in this
there is a lower shrine <foreign lang="greek">κάτω νηός</foreign> (183. 1), distinct from the great
ziggurat of c. 181.</p>
<p>(2) He claims to have seen the temple; but if, as is probable,
Xerxes had destroyed the Esagila, he could not have seen it.</p>
<p>Three explanations may be given (disregarding that of Sayce, that
H. had never been in Babylon):</p>
<p>(1) Baumstark in P. W. thinks the &lsquo;palace&rsquo; of H. is that on the
right bank, and that he does not mention the palace on the left
bank, because he considers it part of the Esagila temple; it actually
was close to it (<foreign rend="ital">v. s.</foreign>). How H. could describe a temple which had
probably ceased to exist, Baumstark does not explain; presumably
this is one of the &lsquo;suspicious confusions&rsquo; of which he speaks.</p>
<p>(2) Hommel (in Hastings, D. B. s. v. Babel) says that Arrian and
Strabo were mistaken. Because Xerxes removed the statue from
Esagila (cf. 183. 3), they thought he had destroyed the temple.
<pb n="141"/>
This explanation is possible; a brick building dismantled about
480 B.C. would speedily fall into decay, and though H. might have
seen it in fair repair circ. 450 B.C., it might well need rebuilding, as
Alexander proposed, in 323 (Strabo, Arrian, <foreign rend="ital">u. s.</foreign>).</p>
<p>(3) The most probable explanation, however, is that of Lehmann
(Klio, i. 273-5), that by the &lsquo;temple of Belus&rsquo; H. means the Nebo
temple in Borsippa. H. distinctly says his temple was on the other
side of the river (<foreign lang="greek">ἐν τῷ ἑτέρῳ</foreign>) from the palace; and as both Marduk
and Nebo were called Bel (&lsquo;Lord&rsquo;), H. may well have confused
them, and transferred the story of the statue to the Nebo temple.
In fact it is not unlikely that the priests told him falsely that the
perished statue had been in their temple, though it had never
belonged to them. It will be seen (184 n.) that H. had special
knowledge of the Nebo temple, and that he carefully avoids saying
where the statue had stood; he leaves it <foreign lang="greek">ἐν τῷ τεμένεϊ</foreign> (183. 2).</p>
<p>The Borsippa temple is the best preserved of the ruins of
Babylon, because of the imperishable material, blue slag, of which
its uppermost story was formed. The present mound, Birs-Nimrud,
is 153 feet high; its circumference is given variously, by Rich,
762 yards; by Rawlinson, 694 (ii. 582); H. gives 811 (four stades, &sect; 3)
for the lowest story, or rather for the brick platform on which it was
raised. It may be noted that H. does not give the absurd height
(606 feet) which Strabo (738) gives to the <foreign lang="greek">τάφος Βήλου</foreign>. The <foreign lang="greek">ἱρόν</foreign>,
which is eight stades round (<foreign lang="greek">δύο σταδίων πάντῃ</foreign>), is the sacred <foreign lang="greek">τέμενος</foreign>
in which the tower stood.</p>
<p>It will be noticed that H. says nothing (in this agreeing with
E. I. H.) of the famous hanging gardens attributed to Nebuchadnezzar 
by Berosus (F. H. G. ii. 507); cf. 185. 1 n.</p></div3>
<div3 id="c.1.181.3" type="section" n="3">
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">πύργος</lemma>. For the eight stories cf. the Cyrus tomb at Murghab
(125. 3 n.). H. is undoubtedly describing a tower with one story
set upon another, each decreasing in size, and thus the ziggurat is
usually restored (cf. Rawlinson, ii. 583-4, for picture). But Meyer,
i. 380 n., says it was a rounded cone, with a sloping way winding
about it to the top; he follows E. Herzfeld (Samarra, 1907), who
gives a beautiful picture of the still-existing minaret of the Samarra
mosque, which, he claims, embodies the idea of the old ziggurat.
The form is certainly very primitive, and Herzfeld maintains that the
sun-burned bricks were not strong enough for such a tower as H.
describes. The Babylonians had, however, kiln-baked bricks as
well, and there is no sufficient reason for describing H.'s view as
mistaken.</p></div3>

Deir el Bahari support the story (cf. <ref target="c.2.143.4" targOrder="U">ii. 143. 4 n.</ref>). It is possible,
<pb n="142"/>
however, that H. may be misled by Egyptian titles; connected with
the temple of Amon were his &lsquo;singing women&rsquo;, chief among whom
was &lsquo;the wife of the god&rsquo;. These are to be distinguished from the
<foreign lang="greek">ἱερόδουλοι</foreign>, and were often women of good position, e.g. Psammetichus
I made his daughter &lsquo;wife of the god&rsquo;; cf. Erman, Egypt, 295-6. If
these are referred to, H. is wrong is saying (182. 2) they were unmarried. 
Frazer (Kingship, p. 170) considers H.'s evidence very
important, as bearing on the supposed &lsquo;divine&rsquo; origin of kings; he
thinks the human bride was one of the &lsquo;brides of Marduk&rsquo; referred
to in the code of Hammurabi.</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">Χαλδαῖοι</lemma>. The original home of this people was on the Persian
Gulf (the &lsquo;Chaldeans&rsquo; of <bibl n="Xen. Anab. 5.5.17">Xen. Anab. v. 5. 17</bibl> are a different tribe
near Armenia, though Rawlinson, <foreign rend="ital">ad loc.</foreign>, thinks them the same);
thence they pushed north, amalgamating with the earlier inhabitants.
Their prince, Merodach Baladan II, ascended the throne of Babylon
in 721 B.C.; the rivalry between his house and race and the priests
of the older races was one of the great causes of the weakness of
Babylonia (cf. 185. 1 and App. II, &sect; 5). By a curious change of
meaning, the Greeks later called the wise priestly class &lsquo;Chaldeans&rsquo;,
and so a tribal name became a caste name (cf. &lsquo;Magi&rsquo; 101 n.). For
this use, which is not native, cf. Daniel (<foreign rend="ital">pass.</foreign>), Strabo 739, &amp;c., and

the same as the one destroyed (&sect; 2); probably it was not. Lehmann
(B. W. f&uuml;r K. P. 1900, 964 n. 6) considers that H. is here borrowing
from Hecataeus (cf. 178. 2 n.); he quotes <foreign lang="greek">χρόνον ἐκεῖνον</foreign> (&sect; 2) in
proof (but <foreign rend="ital">v. i.</foreign>). H. here records an important fact (as Lehmann
points out), though he does not understand it. The god's statue was
the symbol of the independent existence of Babylon, and the king at
the beginning of the year (in the month Nisan) solemnly grasped the
hand of Bel-Marduk, thus acknowledging his supremacy. A conqueror 
by doing this conciliated the prejudices of the Babylonians,
owning himself a native king. So in our earliest important Cassite
inscription (before 1000 B.C.) a Cassite king records that he brought
the statue of Marduk back to Babylon, and becomes &lsquo;king of Babylon&rsquo; 
(Winckler, Der Alte O. vi, 1904, pp. 23-4). So too Cyrus, in the
Cyrus Cylinder (App. IV, &sect; 1 and R. P.<hi rend="sup">2</hi> v. 167), professes that he
rules by the grace of Marduk. Xerxes, giving up this policy of
conciliation, removed the statue, and so &lsquo;destroyed the personal
union between Babylon and Persia&rsquo;; Sennacherib had done the
<pb n="143"/>
same, but his successors had restored the temple and statue of the
god. It is to be noted that Xerxes' title changes at the same time;
in 485 B.C. he is &lsquo;King of Babylon and the lands&rsquo;, afterwards he is
&lsquo;King of Persia and Media&rsquo; (Meyer, iii. 80). Apparently the change
of policy was provoked by Babylonian rebellions which began at the
end of the reign of Darius (so Darius is said &lsquo;to have intended&rsquo;
(<foreign lang="greek">ἐπιβουλεύσας</foreign>) to take the statue; cf. Klio, vii. 447-8, for new inscriptions

<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">Σεμίραμις</lemma>. For this queen cf. inscriptions of &lsquo;Kalach&rsquo; (B. M. G.

the Assyrian Ramm&acirc;nnirari III (812-783 B.C.), and seems to have
introduced the worship of Nebo into Nineveh; hence H. no doubt
heard of her name at the Nebo temple. Her real date almost
corresponds to the &lsquo;five generations&rsquo; of H., i.e. 167 years before
Nebuchadnezzar's accession, 605 B.C. (<foreign rend="ital">v. i.</foreign>) = 772. It is noticeable
that H. gives none of the wild Greek fables as to the mythical
Semiramis (cf. <bibl n="Diod. 2.5">Diod. ii. 5</bibl> seq., following Ctesias), which make her
a sort of Assyrian Catherine II, distinguished equally in war and
for sensuality. No doubt in these stories is reflected the double
character of the goddess Ishtar (cf. 105. 2 n.). Berosus censures
the Greeks (F. H. G. ii. 507) for saying that she founded Nineveh.
For Semiramis cf. Lehmann in Klio, i. 256 seq.</p>
<p>The <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">χώματα</lemma> and the accompanying canals were a well-known
feature of Babylonia from the time of Hammurabi (cf. App. II, &sect; 1)
onwards; they were needed at once to control the floods of the
river (Strabo, 740 seq., a very interesting passage), and for the
irrigation which was essential to the life of the country; it was the
filling up of these canals which has turned one of the most thickly
populated regions of the Old World into the waste of to-day. Their
defensive use (cf. 185. 1 n.) was only secondary. The remains of
thirty or forty canals are still passed in a day's journey (Nikel, p. 9).
For Alexander's care of the canals cf. Strabo, 740-1. For canals
in Babylonia generally cf. Winckler, Hist. of Bab. (tr. by Craig,
1907), pp. 135-9.</p>
<p>No such queen as Nitocris is found either in the Babylonian
inscriptions or in Berosus; H. perhaps misheard the name, and
assimilated it, when he wrote, to the Egyptian name with which he
was more familiar; Lehmann (<foreign rend="ital">u. s.</foreign>) sees in it the consonants of the
Persian form of Nebuchadnezzar, i.e. &lsquo;Nabukadracara&rsquo;, sounded
&lsquo;tracara&rsquo;. Others, however, think that it was not the ignorance of
H., but his informants' prejudice (cf. 181. 5 n.) which is responsible
for the suppression of all mention of this great king; they consider that
in the priestly tradition the works of Nebuchadnezzar were attributed
to his wife, who was a Median princess, Amuita, the daughter of
<pb n="144"/>
Astyages (Berosus, F. H. G. ii. 505); this marriage is probably
referred to i. 74. 4 n. She is said to have suggested the famous
&lsquo;hanging gardens&rsquo;, from a longing for her Median mountain home
(cf. 181. 4 n.). H. confuses her with the mother of the last king,
Nabonidus (&lsquo;Labynetus,&rsquo; 188. 1); this lady seems from the &lsquo;annalistic
tablet&rsquo; to have been an important person (R. P.<hi rend="sup">2</hi> v. 160). Hence in
H. the works of the great Chaldaean king are given to one composite
queen.</p></div3></div>

100 feet high (<bibl n="Xen. Anab. 1.7.15">Xen. Anab. i. 7. 15</bibl>), from the Euphrates to the
Tigris, at the point where the two rivers approached each other

It is usual, however, to omit <foreign lang="greek">ἐς</foreign>, in which case H. means that a
traveller on the Euphrates passed the same village three times in
three days; in this land of marvels he accepted this statement
from some waggish fellow-traveller, who hoaxed him. H. probably
travelled straight by boat from Thapsacus to Babylon (cf. Grote,
<foreign rend="ital">u. s.</foreign>), and the villages he passed were no doubt as much alike as
castles on the Rhine to-day. Matzat (p. 445), however, very ingeniously 
tries to prove that H.'s statement is possible. The river runs
thus <figure/>, each bend being fourteen to eighteen miles
long (+ = site of Ardericca; 1, 2, 3 = the position of the boat on
three following days). He finds a confirmation of these windings

making a mistake, or he is calculating by the time spent on his
journey down stream; he writes as if his boat had made the circuit
of the reservoir (<foreign lang="greek">περίοδος</foreign>, &sect; 6), which can hardly have been the fact.
Abydenus (fr. 9, F. H. G. iv. 283) makes it 40 parasangs, i.e. 1,200
stades, in circumference and 20 fathoms deep. There is no trace
of this reservoir now, but an inscription of Hammurabi says, &lsquo;I set
a marsh around and dug a canal and made a protecting quay&rsquo; (at

Sippara).&rsquo; This work was renewed by the father of Nebuchadnezzar
(V. Scheil, Sippara, 1902, pp. 23, 65). It was intended for irrigation
(cf. the reservoir at Assuan), but no doubt could also be used to
flood the country against an invader. This must be the meaning of
<foreign lang="greek">ὄρυγμα πᾶν ἕλος</foreign> (&sect; 6), but H. has quite failed to understand his
informant, and so his own account is most obscure. He seems to
confuse the canals, along which his boat may well have travelled,

army turned the defensive works on the north of Babylon, by
lowering the water in the Tigris and the Gyndes. (Cf. Caes. B. C.
i. 61 for a similar operation on the Sicoris in 49 B. C.) There was
one battle (R. P. v<hi rend="sup">2</hi>. 162) near Opis, as H. says (190. 1), and it was
immediately followed by a revolt in Akkad (i. e. N. Babylonia).
Meantime Gobryas, marching down the left bank of the Gyndes
with a portion of the army, took Babylon by treachery, while the
main defensive force was resisting Cyrus. In the same way Pr&aacute;&scaron;ek
(i. 229) accepts the story of c. 191 as describing the preparations to
intimidate the capital, and force a capitulation.</p>
<p>Even if these views be correct, the story told to H. was completely 
misleading; the city was taken by treachery (App. IV, &sect; 6).
But it is more likely that H. is partly right (as thus suggested) than
that the whole narrative is an invention borrowed from the irrigation<pb n="147"/>

form it takes is religious in colouring; &lsquo;white horses&rsquo; were sacred

chiefly in the winter and spring, and then as a rule not in large
quantities. Willcocks' table (Irrigation of Mesopotamia, 1910, p. 68)
shows that from May to October the land is practically rainless, in the
other six months the rainfall is about eight inches, fairly evenly
distributed. So far as rain is concerned the country is not a desert
like Egypt, but rather a &lsquo;steppe region capable of sustaining
millions of sheep&rsquo; (p. 10). Grote (iii. 295) lays stress on the accuracy
of H. in contrasting the light rains here with practically rainless
Upper Egypt (iii. 10 n.). H. is quite right in saying that while the
scanty spring rain (<foreign lang="greek">τοῦτο</foreign>) &lsquo;causes the corn to sprout, the crop
ripens from irrigation&rsquo;. His description of this is accurate, if we
remember that he is contrasting the natural (<foreign lang="greek">αὐτοῦ τοῦ ποταμοῦ</foreign>) Nile

flowers, and thus fertilization is effected. H. wrongly thinks the

<p>H.'s account of the Araxes is a characteristic specimen of his
geographical knowledge (and ignorance). He mentions it (1) here,
where it rises among the Matieni (cf. 72. 2 n.) and (<foreign lang="greek">α</foreign>) falls with one
mouth into the Caspian, (<foreign lang="greek">β</foreign>) loses thirty-nine others in marshes;
(2) in iv. 40. 1, flowing east, it forms with the Caspian the north
boundary of his Asia; (3) iv. 11. 1 the Scythians are driven across
it by the Massagetae into Cimmeria.</p>
<p>He is combining four rivers: No. 1 (<foreign lang="greek">α</foreign>) is the Aras, which unites
with the Kur and flows into the S.W. Caspian; in H.'s day the
Aras flowed into the Caspian direct (Hermes, 1884, p. 169); No. 2,
and perhaps No. 1 (<foreign lang="greek">β</foreign>), are a confused account of the two great rivers
of Central Asia, the Oxus and the Jaxartes, which flow north-west into
the Aral Sea; probably at this period the Oxus also flowed into the
Caspian. H. has inverted their direction and combined them,
misled by his information (right in itself) that some of the rivers of
Central Asia lose themselves in swamps (cf. E. B.<hi rend="sup">11</hi> ii. 735). The
East of the world was to H. unknown sandy desert (iii. 98. 2). No. 3
is the Volga. It is quite possible that the &lsquo;marshes and shoals&rsquo; may
be a confused account of the great Volga delta, and not of the
Central Asian rivers, as suggested above.</p>
<p>The name Araxes probably survives in &lsquo;Aroxolani&rsquo; (Jornandes, c.
74), i.e. &lsquo;the Alani of the Araxes&rsquo;. &lsquo;Rha,&rsquo; Ptolemy's name for the Volga
(v. 9), is probably a different word. H.'s confusion may be pardoned
when we find Aristotle (350 A, Meteor. i. 13. 15) making the Tanais
a branch of the Araxes (which he rightly makes to rise in Mount
Paropamisus). So Alexander and his army thought the Jaxartes to
be the Tanais (<bibl n="Plin. Nat. 6.16.49">Plin. N. H. vi. 16. 49</bibl>); Arrian (iii. 30. 7, 8) corrects
this mistake, but makes the Jaxartes rise in the Caucasus. Even
in our own day the head-waters of the Congo were thought by
Livingstone to be the source of the Nile (cf. ii. 33. 1. n.).</p></div3>

between Mesopotamia and the Caspian basin.</p>

<p>H.'s knowledge of the Caspian is one of his geographical triumphs;
subsequent writers, except Aristotle, to the time of Ptolemy (second
century A. D.) thought that it was a gulf of the Northern Sea, as the
Persian Gulf is of the Southern; Alexander (Arr. Anab. vii. 16. 2)

Ptolemy mediaeval cartographers returned to the old blunder

there is no evidence for the borrowing, and it is not likely in itself.

<p>Memphis, Heliopolis, and Thebes represent the three chief forms

or <foreign rend="ital">Tumu</foreign> (the Sun) at Heliopolis, and <foreign rend="ital">Amen-Ra</foreign> at Thebes.</p>
<p><hi rend="bold">Memphis</hi> perhaps was founded by Merpeba, the sixth king of
the First Dynasty, who was combined with Mena the first king (King
and Hall, pp. 91-3). Its age was proverbial in Egypt. Even when,
<pb n="157"/>
under the &lsquo;new Kingdom&rsquo;, Thebes became the capital, M. was
a second capital. Its ruins were largely used for building Cairo,
about fourteen miles to the south of which town it lies, on the left
bank of the Nile, under the rubbish heaps of Bedrash&emacr;n.</p>
<p><hi rend="bold">Thebes.</hi> The usual Egyptian name of the town was <foreign rend="ital">Nu</foreign>, &lsquo;the
town&rsquo; i.e. of Amen-Ra (cf. Hebrew <foreign rend="ital">No</foreign>, Jer. xlvi. 25, and <foreign rend="ital">NoAmon</foreign>, 
Nahum iii. 8); the Greek name is from the less common
Apet. Thebes first became a royal residence under the eleventh
Dynasty. It remained important till the seventh century B.C., when
it was sacked by the Assyrians; from this it never recovered. Its
most important temple was that of Amen-Ra at Karnak; H. (c. 143
nn.) calls it a temple of Zeus.</p>
<p><hi rend="bold">Heliopolis.</hi> Its sacred name was House of Ra, i.e. the Sun-God;
it is the Hebrew <foreign rend="ital">On.</foreign> Its ruins are near Matarieh, which is six miles
NNE. of Cairo, and about four miles E. of the Nile; when H.
speaks (9. 1) of the <foreign lang="greek">ἀνάπλοος</foreign> from Heliopolis to Thebes, he is writing
loosely. Heliopolis was important as a religious, and not as a
political, centre. H. rightly speaks of its inhabitants as &lsquo;most skilled
in tradition&rsquo; (<foreign lang="greek">λογιώτατοι</foreign>); from it were said to have come the
teachers of Pythagoras, Solon, and Plato. Strabo (806) describes
it as a seat of learning, though in his day it was only a show-place.</p></div3>

<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ἴσον . . . ἐπίστασθαι</lemma>. The meaning of these words has been much
disputed.</p>
<p>(1) It is clear that <foreign lang="greek">αὐτῶν</foreign> refers to divine <emph>things</emph>, not merely
to the divine <emph>names</emph> (as B&auml;hr); H. did not think all men knew
equally the names of the gods.</p>
<p>(2) Wiedemann's explanation, too, must be rejected. He argues
that H. means that, since all men agree as to the gods, it is only
necessary to mention their names (which differ in different races), and
then men will understand each other. But this statement again is
not true; H. does not think all men's knowledge of divine things is
equal; on the contrary, he thinks Greek knowledge much inferior to
that in Egypt (cf. e.g. 43. 2 as to Heracles). (3) The usual explanation
(e.g. Stein's) is that <foreign lang="greek">ἴσον</foreign> = just as much, i.e. &lsquo;just as little&rsquo;; since
men really know nothing of divine things (cf. ix. 65) they should not
laugh at each other's beliefs. This pessimistic view would be quite
in accordance with H.'s general attitude (cf. Introd. &sect; 36), and may
be compared to Xenophanes' sentiment (fr. 14, R. and P. p. 80) <foreign lang="greek">οὐδέ
τισἔσται εἰδὼς ἀμφὶ θεῶν</foreign>. (4) But this explanation does not take account
of the character of the passages where H. lays stress on his silence
(<foreign rend="ital">v.i.</foreign>); in view of these Sourdille (R. pp. 2-26), who discusses the
whole subject at length, maintains that the reference is to the &lsquo;mysteries&rsquo;. 
Since these, H. thinks, are virtually the same in all countries
(cf. 81. 2, 123. 2, 3), to describe the Egyptian mysteries would be to
reveal the secrets of the Greek ones. Hence H. is careful only to
<pb n="158"/>
touch on them (cf. 65. 2 <foreign lang="greek">αὐτῶν ἐπιψαύσας, ἀναγκαίῃ καταλαμβανόμενος</foreign>); 
he will describe details, but not relate the <foreign lang="greek">ἱρὸς λόγος</foreign> which
explained them. The following are the passages in Bk. II where
H. is religiously silent: 46. 2 (the goat-footed Pan), 47. 2 (the sacrifice

<p><hi rend="bold"><foreign lang="greek">τὸν ἐνιαυτόν</foreign>. I. The Problem of the Calendar.</hi> The difficulty of
all calendars is to reconcile a lunar and a solar system of reckoning; by
the former the year consists of 354 days, by the latter of about 365 1/4.
(The exact figures are:              days   hours    min.  sec.
  a lunation ...    ...    ...   ...  29     12      44     3
  a lunar year      ...    ...   ... 354      8      48    36
  a solar year      ...    ...   ... 365      5      48    48.)</p>
<p>The calendar had to be regulated (1) in order to secure the
proper recurrence of feasts (hence month-names are often taken
from festivals; cf. Curtius, G. H. ii. 23 f. for the connexion of Delphi
and the calendar). (2) To regulate civil procedure. Two problems
arise: (<foreign rend="ital">a</foreign>) to adjust the civil month to the motions of the moon; (<foreign rend="ital">b</foreign>)
to adjust the lunar month and the solar year.</p>
<p><hi rend="bold">II. Greek Solutions.</hi> The Greeks adopted a lunar reckoning,
making the months alternately of 30 and 29 days; this was arranged
by Solon (cf. <bibl n="Plut. Sol. 25">Plut. Sol. 25</bibl>, and L. and S. <foreign rend="ital">s. v.</foreign> <foreign lang="greek">ἕνος</foreign>). It is said that he
tried further to rectify the error thus arising from the shortness of
his year (which was only 30 x 6 + 29 x 6 = 354 days), by inserting
an intercalary month every other year (<foreign lang="greek">διὰ τρίτου ἔτεος</foreign>, for which
phrase cf. 37. 2 <foreign lang="greek">διὰ τρίτης ἡμέρης</foreign>, and iii. 97. 3). H. here and in i. 32. 3
definitely asserts that this was the Greek system in his day.</p>
<p>Others, however (e.g. Stein), argue that H. has misunderstood the
system; an intercalary month every other year would give 738 days
in two years, instead of 730 1/2. Hence they argue that the real
system in H.'s time was to introduce three (not four, as H.) intercalary 
months in every period of eight years; this would give a
fairly accurate result, i.e. 354 x 8 + 90 = 2922 = 8 x 365 1/4. This
seems really to have been the arrangement in H.'s own day; but the
date of its introduction is uncertain. Unger argues (I. M&uuml;ller,
Handb. der klass. Alt.-Wiss. i. 569-70) that the eight-year period
existed from quite early times, at any rate from the eighth century,
as is shown by myths and customs (Plut. Mor. 418), and (presumably)
that the three intercalary months in each period are also early; Solon
may have used this system. The calendar was further adjusted by
<pb n="159"/>
Meton in Periclean times, who introduced a nineteen-years' cycle.
For a brief account of the whole subject cf. Abbott, Outlines of Gk.
Hist. pp. 10 seq.</p>
<p><hi rend="bold">III. Egyptian Solutions.</hi> The Egyptians were the first people
who definitely adopted a solar year of twelve months with thirty
days in each; this began July 19 (according to the Julian calendar),
i.e. 1st of Thoth according to the Egyptian, which was about a month
in advance of the real solar year. On this day Sirius (Sothis) is first
visible in the morning, in the latitude of Memphis (cf. <foreign lang="greek">ἄστρων</foreign>).
This coincides with the beginning of the rise of the Nile (19. 2 n.).
Five days were added (<foreign lang="greek">ἐπαγόμεναι</foreign>) at the end of the year. So far
H. is right; but he quite fails to grasp the methods by which the
Egyptians tried to reconcile this year of 365 days with the real solar
year of 365 1/4 days (roughly) (cf. <foreign lang="greek">ὁ κύκλος . . . ἐς τὠυτὸ παραγίνεται</foreign>).
This is not surprising, as scholars are not agreed even now as to
their methods.</p>
<p>Brugsch says they had anticipated the Julian calendar, and to
every fourth year added an extra day, i.e. making it a leap year.
Certainly J. Caesar was said to have derived his calendar from
Egypt (Dio Cass. xliii. 26). This view seems to be a mistake.
Ptolemy Euergetes (238 B.C.), by the decree of Canopus, tried to
introduce this (i.e. the Julian) system, but in vain. The Egyptians,
however, recognized that their common year and the real year (the
&lsquo;Sothic year&rsquo;) did not agree, and that the &lsquo;common year&rsquo; grew later
and later; hence the calculation of the &lsquo;Sothic period&rsquo; (<foreign lang="greek">κυνικὸς
κύκλος</foreign>) of 1,460 years (= 1,461 &lsquo;common years&rsquo;), at the expiration of
which the mistake had rectified itself (1/4 day per year for 1,460 years
= a year of 365 days). The first &lsquo;Sothic period&rsquo; is said to begin
4241 B.C. (but cf. App. X, &sect; 2). Hence the date of the arrangement
of the calendar is fixed for this year, &lsquo;the first certain date in the
world's history&rsquo; (Meyer, i, &sect;&sect; 159, 195-7). Cf. also B. M. G. pp. 182
seq. for a short but clear account of the Egyptian calendar.</p>
<p>The five &lsquo;extra days&rsquo; can be traced on the monuments as far
back as the 6th Dynasty.</p></div3>

it was a practical measure, not strictly a measure of length (cp.
Germ. &lsquo;Stunde&rsquo;). Strabo (804) says that it varied from 30 to 120
stades. H. gives it a uniform value of 60 stades, and so is inaccurate
in his results; here he exaggerates, and makes Egypt, which has
really only about 2200 stades of sea-coast, to have &lsquo;3600&rsquo;. It is
noticeable that &lsquo;60 stades&rsquo; was the estimate of a <foreign lang="greek">σχοῖνος</foreign> from
Thebes to Syene (Artemidorus in Strabo, 804), which confirms
H.'s statement that he had been south of Thebes (29 nn.).</p>
<p>Lehmann (W. K. P. 1895, pp. 180-2), however, explains more
elaborately H.'s errors here and in cc. 9, 149. He argues (1) that the
<foreign lang="greek">σχοῖνος</foreign> = the parasang = 30 stades; (2) that H. has taken the figures
from his source&mdash;probably Hecataeus&mdash;and has wrongly doubled the
size of the <foreign lang="greek">σχοῖνος</foreign>; (3) that perhaps this mistake is due to the confusion 
of the smaller and the larger &lsquo;kaspu&rsquo;&mdash;Babylonian measures
<pb n="161"/>
of one and of two parasangs respectively. His proof may be given
in the following table:

<p>It is not certain, however, that measurements &lsquo;as the crow flies&rsquo;
were made before Eratosthenes (circ. 230 B.C.), and the fact that in
Egyptian land measurement &lsquo;all angles were treated as though they
were right angles&rsquo; (Lyons, Survey, p. 48) does not inspire confidence;
there is no evidence that Hecataeus or any other Greek before H.
had attempted to give measures for Egypt. H. certainly seems to
speak in c. 9 as if he were measuring along the river.</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">τοῦ Πλινθινήτεω</lemma>. Plinthine lay near the later Alexandria, on the
Mareotic Lake; H. (18. 2) mentions Marea as one of the border

<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">Σερβωνίδος</lemma>. This lake (now dry) lay parallel to the sea on the
east side of Egypt (cf. <ref target="c.3.5.3" targOrder="U">iii. 5. 3 n.</ref>). It was much feared for its
swampy shores, which were said to be covered with drifted sand,
and so to engulf the unwary (cf. Diod. i. 30; Milton, Paradise Lost,
ii. 592-4):

<p>The army of Darius Ochus in 350 B.C. was said to have perished
thus. It lay under Mount Casius, the real boundary of Egypt and
Syria (158. 4); this was a sand dune of no great height, the modern
R&acirc;s el Kasr&ucirc;n, crowned with a temple to Baal (cf. the Baal-Zephon

Egypt ceases and Nubia begins. Others refer these phrases to the
<emph>breadth</emph>, not the length of the land, meaning that beyond the Nile
Valley on east and west lie Arabia and Libya, <foreign rend="ital">not Egypt.</foreign></p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">καὶ δέκα</lemma>: these words are inserted without MS. authority to
make H. consistent. It is calculated that he gives the whole
distance from Heliopolis to the frontier as 13 2/3 days; for from
Heliopolis to Thebes, reckoning 540 stades a day, is 9 days (9. 2);
from Thebes to Elephantine is 3 1/3 days more [&lsquo;1,800 stades&rsquo;, 9. 2];
from Elephantine to the frontier is 12 <foreign lang="greek">σχοῖνοι</foreign>, which, according to his
usual method of calculation (6. 1 n., i.e. 9 <foreign lang="greek">σχοῖνοι</foreign> to the day's
journey), make 1 1/3 days; i.e. 9 + 3 1/3 + 1 1/3 = 13 2/3 in all. This change of
reading also would explain H.'s strange statement (below) that Egypt
becomes &lsquo;broad again&rsquo;; he would mean the same as in 29. 3, i. e.
that where Egypt and Aethiopia join, at the island of Tachompso,
there is a &lsquo;smooth plain&rsquo;. Of course this is not accurate geographically, 
but H. does not pretend to have seen the country
beyond Elephantine (29. 2).
<pb n="163"/></p>
<p>It is usual to alter the reading; but the mistake (of omitting
<foreign lang="greek">δέκα</foreign>) is as old as Aristides (ii. 343), i.e. as the second century A.D.</p>
<p>If the reading be not altered, three explanations of H.'s mistake
are possible, not to mention the drastic measure of arguing that
he had never been up the Nile beyond the Fay&ucirc;m at all (c. 29 nn.):</p>
<p>I. That H. never left his boat, and hence was misled by a
merely temporary widening of the Nile valley; of these there are
several; we may compare for such a mistake his strange statement
as to Ardericca on the Euphrates (i. 185 n.). Measurements were
always difficult to ancient travellers; so Strabo (789), a trained
geographer, says that the maximum width of <foreign lang="greek">ἡ ποταμία Αἴγυπτος</foreign> is
300 stades, which is nearly three times too much.</p>
<p>II. Wiedemann argues that H. is misled by a theory of Hecataeus 
(?), that Egypt was like a double axe in shape <foreign lang="greek">ΔΔ</foreign> (cf.
Scylax, p. 106, G. G. M. i. 81). This theory was based on
symmetry, and there is supposed to be another fragment of it in
28. 3 (see n.), the statement that the Nile flowed north as well as
south. But (<foreign rend="ital">a</foreign>) Hecataeus could not have held this theory, for to
him only the Delta was Egypt (16. 1 n.); (<foreign rend="ital">b</foreign>) if Hecataeus had held
it, surely H. would have been eager to refute a view so absurd
(cf. c. 45 n.).</p>
<p>III. A new and very ingenious explanation of H.'s geography of
the Nile Valley has been given by Sourdille (H. E. pp. 112 seq.).</p>
<p>He maintains three points:</p>
<p>A. That the &lsquo;Arabian mountain&rsquo; is conceived of as running in
<foreign rend="ital">two directions, practically at right angles to each other</foreign>, starting
from the &lsquo;quarries&rsquo;. He translates 8. 2 <foreign lang="greek">ταύτῃ λῆγον κτλ</foreign>. &lsquo;The
mountain ceases on this side and makes a bend towards what I
have said&rsquo; (he means the <foreign lang="greek">Ἐρυθρὴ θάλασσα</foreign> in its northern extension,
i.e. the Red Sea proper); &lsquo;in its most extended part (i.e. that from
east to west) it would take, as I learned, two months&rsquo; journey from
east to west, and its eastern end would produce incense.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He argues:</p>
<p>(1) That as the &lsquo;Arabian mountain&rsquo; is described at first as
running north and south, its course after its &lsquo;bend&rsquo; (<foreign lang="greek">ἀνακαμπτει</foreign>)
must be different, i. e. east and west.</p>
<p>(2) <foreign lang="greek">μακρότατον</foreign> must refer to the &lsquo;length&rsquo; east and west of the
chain, not (as Stein) to its &lsquo;broadening&rsquo; out in the south.</p>
<p>(3) H. clearly distinguishes two parts of the &lsquo;Arabian mountain&rsquo;
in &sect; 2; he mentions one part of the <foreign lang="greek">τὸ πρὸς Λιβύης ὄρος</foreign> as running
south, <foreign lang="greek">τεταμένον τὸν αὐτὸν τρόπον καὶ τοῦ Ἀραβίου τὰ πρὸς μεσαμβρίην
φέροντα</foreign>; this implies that there was another part of the Arabian
mountain that did not &lsquo;run south&rsquo;. Sourdille points out that H.
always gives a direction as from east to west, even though (as
here) the starting-point is in the west; also that the mention of
the &lsquo;spice-bearing regions&rsquo; (8. 1) at once suggests Arabia (iii.
107. 1).
<pb n="164"/></p>
<p>For the geography generally of this part of the mountain chain,
cf. 73. 1 n. and 158. 2-3, where he mentions the &lsquo;gap&rsquo; in the
mountains, <foreign rend="ital">running east and west</foreign>, through which the canal of
Necho passed. This explanation is almost certainly right.</p>
<p>B. That the reading <foreign lang="greek">τεσσέρων</foreign> is right. Sourdille points out
that the Ethiopians (29. 4) hold <foreign lang="greek">τὰ ἀπὸ Ἐλεφαντίνης</foreign>; hence the
conjecture &lsquo;fourteen&rsquo; carries H. <foreign rend="ital">outside Egypt</foreign> (cf. 8. 3 n.). Retaining 
&lsquo;four&rsquo;, he thinks that <foreign lang="greek">τὸ ἐνθεῦτεν αὖτις εὐρέα</foreign> refers to the Fay&ucirc;m.
This really is only one day south of Heliopolis; but H. clearly
thought it much further south; for</p>
<p>(1) He obviously conceives it as bordering on the &lsquo;Thebaic
nome&rsquo; and as &lsquo;seven days&rsquo; voyage from the sea (4. 3).</p>
<p>(2) The branch of the Nile, the Bahr Y&ucirc;s&ucirc;f, which waters the
Fay&ucirc;m, finally leaves the Nile almost exactly &lsquo;four days' journey&rsquo;
above Heliopolis, near the modern Si&ucirc;t. If H. conceived this as
running west, instead of north and south, we can understand how
&lsquo;Egypt&rsquo; appeared to him to broaden out &lsquo;four days&rsquo; above Heliopolis 
(cf. 150. 1 n.). He certainly did not realize that it ran
parallel to the Nile, as a branch of it, for he says (17. 3) the Nile
above the Delta flows <foreign lang="greek">εἷς ἐών</foreign>.</p>
<p>(3) This seems confirmed by what H. says as to Egypt being
&lsquo;the gift of the Nile&rsquo; (5. 1). The priests told him this was so
as far as L. Moeris, i.e. as far as the source of the Bahr Y&ucirc;s&ucirc;f
mentioned above. H., however, tacitly corrects this by adding
&lsquo;the land above the lake for three days' journey&rsquo; as <foreign lang="greek">ἕτερον τοιοῦτον</foreign>,
i.e. he thinks the Nile deposit begins, <emph>not</emph> &lsquo;seven days from the
sea&rsquo;, but further up still where the Bahr Y&ucirc;s&ucirc;f <emph>first</emph> leaves the
Nile, near Farsh&ucirc;t, &lsquo;three days' journey&rsquo; above Si&ucirc;t. This
explanation is possible; it saves the veracity of H., but at the
expense of his geographical intelligence.</p>
<p>C. <hi rend="ital">That in this misunderstanding lies the explanation of H.'s
statement that the Nile overflows &lsquo;for two days' journey</hi>, more or
less, on each side&rsquo; (19. 1).</p>
<p>What the canals of the Nile do, that it does itself. The Bahr
Y&ucirc;s&ucirc;f on the west and the canal of Necho on the east have the
extension here mentioned, which is obviously wrong if attributed
to the Nile itself.</p>

at this rate the whole distance from the sea to Elephantine  <emph>up

c. 175 the voyage  <emph>down stream</emph> only to Sais takes twenty days.
<pb n="165"/></p>
<p>Two explanations may be given of the discrepancy: (1)
Wiedemann's (doubtfully) that H. went up stream by an unusually
fast boat, a fact which would partly explain his scanty knowledge
of Upper Egypt; the figure in c. 175 is that of a heavy-laden cargo
boat. (2) (More probably) the figure here is a mere calculation,
based on the supposed rate of &lsquo;nine schoenes a day&rsquo;; the figure in
c. 175 is that of an actual voyage. Sourdille (H. E. p. 109) thinks
the &lsquo;nine days&rsquo; the official estimate for a fast government boat
(cf. viii. 98 for the post system); H. has taken this as if it were the
normal speed. The journey from Heliopolis to Thebes by boat
usually now takes over twelve days (Stein).</p></div3>

and under its supposed name &lsquo;Saitic&rsquo;.</p>
<p>(3) Sourdille (H. E. 53) thinks that the Tanitic arm was called
&lsquo;Sanitic&rsquo;, and that H., not recognizing its connexion with the <foreign lang="greek">Τανίτης

and that the real question was&mdash;should they join Inaros in revolt or

winds (20. 2) and of the &lsquo;fresh wind&rsquo; (96. 3) up the Nile. He means
(cf. c. 27) that there are no breezes down the Nile, i. e. <emph>from</emph> the
south, whence the Nile flows; this is practically right. In five
months (from June to October) scientific observation shows that the
wind blows from this direction only about one day in twelve

<p>It is very near the truth. The Nile rises partly because of the
heavy rains on the Abyssinian plateau, partly from the melting
<pb n="170"/>
snow on the mountains round the Great Lakes; the former are
brought down by the Blue Nile, the latter by the White Nile,
which meet at Khartoum. H. rejects the theory because: (1) &lsquo;It
flows from the hottest lands to those of which most are colder&rsquo;, as
is shown by the warmth of the winds. (2) Upper Egypt was
rainless (cf. <ref target="c.3.10.3" targOrder="U">iii. 10. 3 n.</ref>), and Aethiopia must also be so; but snow
is always followed by rain within five days (&sect; 3). (3) The inhabitants 
are black from the heat (&sect; 3). (4) The birds do not migrate
from Aethiopia, as they would do were there winter there (&sect; 4).
H. tries to apply critical tests to a fact which seems to him insufficiently

(Tozer, A. G. p. 21), but (2) it suited the Greek notion of symmetry;
Delphi was the centre of the earth, and the Ocean supplied a natural
circumference. (3) Facts were supposed to confirm it; the Greeks
knew of water in the furthest west and south, and the Caspian was
supposed to be an arm on the North Ocean; cf. <ref target="c.1.202.4" targOrder="U">i. 202. 4 n.</ref> for
H.'s rejection of this view. Berger, pp. 36, 41, asserts that H. is wrong
in deriving the theory of the Ionian physicists from Homer; but
his assertion is neither proved nor probable. H. rightly rejects
the theory of the circumambient ocean as unsupported by evidence.

<p>H. now states &lsquo;more fully&rsquo; the theory sketched in c. 24 (<foreign lang="greek">ἐν
ἐλαχίστῳ δηλῶσαι</foreign>). The sun &lsquo;in the winter is blown out of his
course by the storms&rsquo; (24. 1) from the north, and so &lsquo;crosses over
the upper parts of Libya&rsquo;. Hence evaporation there is abundant
(&sect;&sect; 1-2) and so the Nile loses its water; the south and south-west
winds blowing from this quarter are wet, but part of the moisture
&lsquo;remains with&rsquo; the sun (&sect; 3, <foreign rend="ital">v. i.</foreign>). When &lsquo;the winter storms begin
to be less severe&rsquo; (&sect; 3), the sun returns to his normal course, and
then &lsquo;draws water from all rivers equally&rsquo;. Hence in the summer
the Nile is like all other rivers in the amount of evaporation from
<pb n="171"/>
it; but in the winter &lsquo;it alone suffers from the sun&rsquo;, and so its
course is &lsquo;lower than in the summer&rsquo; (&sect; 5). In fact, H. thinks
the normal height of the Nile is its summer flood, and the low
Nile of the winter is the exception.</p>
<p>This theory is referred to in Aristoph. Nub. 273, and is attacked

<p>The name &lsquo;Nile&rsquo; is probably Semitic = &lsquo;river&rsquo;, the native name
was H&amacr;pi; for an image of the river-god cf. B. M. G. p. 12. The
source of the Nile was an insoluble problem till the latter half of
the nineteenth century. H. wisely gives it up, but narrates a story
which he heard on good authority, but thinks was meant &lsquo;as a
joke&rsquo; (<foreign lang="greek">παίζειν</foreign>). His narrative is attacked in two ways.</p>
<p>(1) He is accused of believing the story which he definitely
rejects, e.g. by Strabo (819 <foreign lang="greek">Ἡρόδ. φλυαρεῖ ἥδυσμά τι τῷ λόγῳ τὴν
τερατείαν προσφέρων</foreign>. Cf. Mure, iv. 387). This charge simply proves
the carelessness of his critics.</p>
<p>(2) The second charge is more serious, and is as old as Aristides
(ii. 344-5): If H. had been on the spot, how could he repeat
a story so obviously false? Three answers may be given: (<foreign rend="ital">a</foreign>)
Stein thinks H. simply refers to the narrow bed of the river at
Syene; but this explanation cannot be got out of the text. (<foreign rend="ital">b</foreign>)
Perhaps Sourdille (H. E. 227 seq.) is right in saying that H. thought
<pb n="172"/>
the town on the island &lsquo;Elephantine&rsquo; and Syene opposite to be
only <emph>one town</emph>; this he called &lsquo;Elephantine&rsquo; and frequently mentions; 
Syene, on the other hand, he never mentions except here.
He may well therefore have thought Syene to be some place,
<foreign rend="ital">unvisited by him</foreign>, away to the south; <foreign rend="ital">hence the Saite's story might
be right</foreign>, and he gives it and criticizes it. (<foreign rend="ital">c</foreign>) Hauvette's (pp. 16, 17)
view, however, is preferable, that H. means <foreign lang="greek">παίζειν</foreign> to indicate definite
rejection of the story, which he still goes on to criticize. It may
be noted that H.'s account made so great an impression that Tacitus
(Ann. ii. 61) puts &lsquo;angustiae et profunda altitudo nullis inquirentium 
spatiis penetrabilis&rsquo; among the wonders of Egypt, to which
Germanicus &lsquo;gave his attention&rsquo;.</p>
<p>A further point arises&mdash;what did the Saite really mean? Probably 
&lsquo;he was speaking what (he meant to be) true&rsquo; (&sect; 5 <foreign lang="greek">γινόμενα</foreign>).
Three views may be mentioned: (1) Maspero thinks (E. M. iii.
382 seq.) that H. has taken as geography what was really mythology. 
In the Ritual of Embalmment the dead is addressed, &lsquo;He
(the Nile) gives thee the water which has come from Elephantine,
the Nile which has come from the two gulfs, the Nou which has
come from the two rocks.&rsquo; A bas-relief has been found at Philae
representing the Nile god in a cavern under a rock, pouring out
two Niles (cf. B. M. G. p. 8 for picture). Maspero further explains
&lsquo;Krophi&rsquo; and &lsquo;Mophi&rsquo; to be &lsquo;Qer H&amacr;pi&rsquo; (cavern of the Nile god)
and &lsquo;Mu-H&amacr;pi&rsquo; (water of the Nile god). He thinks that the priest
also said that there were two Niles, one of Egypt, and one of
Ethiopia; of these the former flowed along the right bank, the
latter along the left. H. misunderstood his informant, and supposed 
the &lsquo;Nile of Ethiopia&rsquo; meant the Nile flowing towards
Ethiopia, as opposed to the Nile of Egypt. (2) The B. M. G.
makes the two Niles the rivers of Upper and of Lower Egypt
respectively. (3) Breasted (pp. 55-6) says there was supposed to
be an underground Nile, by which the sun returned at night to the
east; some thought it came up again as the Indus; this was
connected with the real Nile at Elephantine, which was originally
the limit of Egyptian knowledge to the south.</p>
<p>Maspero's view is probably nearest to what the Saite said. It is
quite needless to see the influence of Hecataeus (cf. 8. 3 n.) in the story.</p>

Sayce (<foreign rend="ital">ad loc.</foreign> and Introd. p. 27; also in J. of P. xiv). His arguments
are (answers are added in brackets):
<pb n="173"/></p>
<p>(1) Elephantine is an island&mdash;not a town (it is both, cf. Artace
iv. 14. 2, and in Egyptian records is frequently called &lsquo;a town&rsquo;).</p>
<p>(2) H. makes Amasis bring stones from Elephantine (175. 3 n.);
the red granite quarries were really at Syene (cf. &lsquo;Syenite&rsquo;). (But
Egyptian sources also call granite &lsquo;stone from Elephantine&rsquo;.)</p>
<p>(3) H. could never have been at Thebes, or he would describe
the great buildings there. (The argument <foreign rend="ital">ex silentio</foreign> is always most
untrustworthy; cf. also 143. 2 n.)</p>
<p>(4) Had H. been at Elephantine he would have known more of
the Nile's course above it. (But cf. notes on following chapters,
which show that his knowledge was really considerable.)</p>
<p>Sayce's attack is usually held to fail completely.</p>
<p>Elephantine = &lsquo;Elephant town&rsquo;, because here the Nubians brought
their ivory for tribute (iii. 97. 3) or to exchange it for Egyptian
products.</p></div3>
<div3 id="c.2.29.2" type="section" n="2">
<p>H. is quite right in his description of the way in which a boat is
towed up the first cataract&mdash;&lsquo;from both sides&rsquo; (<foreign lang="greek">δια</foreign>-; <foreign lang="greek">ἀμφοτέρωθεν</foreign>
is really superfluous); he does not give the exaggerated difficulties
which later writers ascribe to the cataracts, e.g. that the dwellers
around were permanently deaf from the noise (Cicero, Som. Scip. 5).
&lsquo;The foaming rapids of the Great Cataract are now things of the
past&rsquo; (Baedeker, p. 335), owing to the Nile Dam built just above.</p></div3>
<div3 id="c.2.29.3" type="section" n="3">
<p>For the rest of this chapter cf. E. Sparig, Herodot's Angaben
&uuml;ber die Nill&auml;nder oberhalb Syene's, Halle, 1889. He seems
clearly right in identifying Tachompso with Djerar, an island
south of Dakkeh, some 78 (Murray, p. 519 and map) miles from
Syene; H. here, as usual, reckons the <foreign lang="greek">σχοῖνος</foreign> at 60 stades (cf. Strabo,
804, and 6. 1 n.), which gives about 80 miles for the distance.
This was the natural boundary of the two nations (&sect; 4); just
below Djerar was Hierasykaminos, the southern limit of Egypt under
the Ptolemies. H. makes no distinction between the first cataract,
which begins just below Philae, and the Nile above it.</p>
<p>Others, however (e.g. Wiedemann), wrongly identify Tachompso
with Philae; Strabo (818) calls Philae <foreign lang="greek">κοινὴ κατοικία Αἰθιόπων καὶ
Αἰγυπτίων. σχοῖνος</foreign> is then explained as the space a man could
tow before being relieved, i.e. about 500 yards; cf. Jerome (on Joel
iii. 18) &lsquo;In Nilo solent naves funibus trahere, certa habentes spatia,
quae appellant funiculos&rsquo;. But this identification of Tachompso
with Philae is not what H. says, and it leaves his &lsquo;four days&rsquo; quite
unexplained. The distance from Syene to Philae could really be
done in rather more than five hours, but perhaps the boatmen
demanded such a fee of H. that he imagined it must mean a four
days' journey. At all events he never went up the cataract.</p>
<p>There is no lake either at Philae or at Djerar; but the Nile widens
out above Philae, and at various places south of that island.</p></div3>
<div3 id="c.2.29.4" type="section" n="4">
<p>H. does not give the time spent on &lsquo;the lake&rsquo;, i.e. between Philae
and the second cataract at Wadi Halfa (where the boat was left
<pb n="174"/>
<foreign lang="greek">ἀποβάς</foreign>). If this be reckoned at four days, H.'s account gives
60 days from Syene to Meroe, i.e. 4 days for the rapids, 4 days for
the lake, 40 days' land journey, and 12 more by boat again. This
corresponds to the estimate of Timosthenes, admiral of Ptolemy
Philadelphus (60 days from Syene to Meroe, Pliny, <bibl n="Plin. Nat. 6.35">N. H. vi. 183</bibl>);
&lsquo;this is a very fair approximation to the truth&rsquo; (Bunbury, i. 302).</p></div3>

<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">σκόπελοι κτλ</lemma>.: the obstructions on the river, beginning with the
second cataract just above Halfa. The river in modern times is
usually left here by travellers; the railway from Halfa runs to Abu
Hammed, where the Nile turns south-west; the caravan route
went straight across the desert from Korosko, 90 miles below
Halfa.</p></div3>
<div3 id="c.2.29.6" type="section" n="6">
<p>The &lsquo;island&rsquo; of Meroe later was formed by the Nile and the
Atbara (Astaboras), just south of Berber, and ruins of pyramids
have been found in this region at Bakarawiya, south of the junction 
of the two rivers. H., however, probably means the town of
Napata, the northern capital of the Aethiopian kingdom, which lay
(near the modern Merawi, which preserves the name) some thirty
miles south-west of the fourth cataract, under the &lsquo;holy mountain&rsquo;,
Gebel Barkal. (So Sparig, and Hall in Murray, p. 552.)</p>
<p>H. had certainly never heard of the River Atbara (cf. iv. 50. 1),
and the southern site for Meroe seems inconsistent with (30. 1) the
statement that Meroe is only half way to the &lsquo;Deserters&rsquo;.</p>
<p>If, however, Meroe be Napata, then the &lsquo;twelve days' voyage&rsquo;
must be explained as <foreign rend="ital">not continuous</foreign>, as H. had been told, but made
up of two parts, one from just below Djerar (<foreign rend="ital">u. s.</foreign>) to Halfa, and one
from El Debba (south of Dongola) to Merawi.</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">Δία</lemma>. There is a temple of Amon (i.e. Zeus) at Napata, where
he was worshipped in a ram-headed shape. H. is quite right in
speaking of the theocratic character of the Ethiopian kingdom;
the oracle at Napata chose the king (cf. <bibl n="Diod. 3.5.6">Diod. iii. 5. 6</bibl> of the later
Meroe). As Ethiopia had been conquered by kings from Thebes,
the Theban deities naturally were more prominent there, and the
high priests of Amon, expelled by the 22nd dynasty from Thebes,
had retired to Ethiopia (Maspero, Annuaire des E. G. 1877, p. 126
seq., gives interesting details as to the working of the oracle).</p></div3></div>

<p>Eratosthenes (in Strabo 786) calls these deserters <foreign lang="greek">Σεμβρῖται</foreign>, i.e.

or in Sennaar (Bunbury), about 150 miles south of Khartoum, or
where the Sobat joins the White Nile, about 400 miles south of
Khartoum. It is in the last region that the Nile ceases to flow
west and north-west and turns north (cf. 31 n.).</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">Ἀσμάχ</lemma>. The translation &lsquo;left&rsquo; is a popular explanation, perhaps
given by an interpreter; the real meaning of the word was &lsquo;forgetting&rsquo;,

<p>The number 240,000 is doubtless much exaggerated.</p>
<p>Elephantine, Marea, Daphnae are the three gates of Egypt

L. Menzaleh, between the Delta and the Suez Canal; it lies on the
Pelusiac arm of the Nile (now a canal). (Petrie, E. E. F. iv. (1888)
47.) Here the earliest remains belong to the Ramesside age; but the
fort was founded by Psammetichus I, and the oldest finds in it were
mainly Greek (ib. p. 48); then from the sixth century Greek remains
disappear (p. 52). All this agrees with H.; cf. 107. 1 for Sesostris
(i. e. Rameses II; but cf. App. X. 5, 7) at Daphnae, and 154. 3 for the
planting the Greeks on the Pelusiac arm, and their subsequent
removal by Amasis. H., however, distinguishes Daphnae and &lsquo;the
Camps&rsquo;, whereas Petrie makes them the same; probably both are
right; one of the military &lsquo;camps&rsquo; lay outside the native town, but
continuous with it. Daphnae guarded &lsquo;the great highway into
Syria&rsquo; (Petrie <foreign rend="ital">u. s.</foreign>); cf. 141. 4 <foreign lang="greek">ταύτῃ εἰσὶν αἱ ἐσβολαί</foreign>.</p></div3>

that H. was in Egypt after 454 B.C. (cf. App. IX, &sect; 1). The garrison
at Marea was given up, because the Libyans to the west were
completely reduced (Stein, cf. iii. 91; iv. 167 seq.); this reason is
more probable than that of Krall, viz. that the defence of the west
was entrusted to native princes, e.g. Inaros and Thannyras (iii. 15).
Sourdille (H. E. p. 3) thinks that H. had been told generally that &lsquo;the
Persian garrison system was the same&rsquo; as the Egyptian, but says
nothing special as to Marea, because he had not verified the statement 
as to the garrison there personally, as he had done at
Elephantine and at Daphnae. This explanation seems over-subtle.</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ἐς Αἰθιοπίην</lemma>. One of the points attacked in the story is the implication

<p>(1) The usual view, e.g. Rawlinson's, is that H. means the Nile
was flowing from east to west at the furthest point at which he
knew of it, i.e. in the land of the Deserters.</p>
<p>(2) But this is not the natural sense of the passage, and it is
better to suppose that H. conceives the Nile as flowing from the
west in <foreign rend="ital">all its course</foreign> above Elephantine (Bunbury, i. 266, 303),
because</p>
<p>(<foreign rend="ital">a</foreign>) He compares it with the Danube, c. 33;</p>
<p>(<foreign rend="ital">b</foreign>) Europe is &lsquo;beyond comparison&rsquo; the broadest of his continents
(iv. 42. 1 n.); but this could hardly be the case, if Africa were more
than four mountains &lsquo;broad&rsquo; from north to south, as explanation (1)
would make it.</p>
<p>(<foreign rend="ital">c</foreign>) When Cambyses attacks the Ethiopians, at &lsquo;the end of the
world&rsquo;, &lsquo;on the sea to the south of Africa&rsquo; (iii. 17. 5), he does not
march up the Nile, but plunges into the deserts just south of
Thebes. Obviously, then, the Nile is here conceived as coming not
from the south but from the west. Some have tried to identify the
Ethiopians with the Deserters, but this is flatly contradictory to H.</p>
<p>H. is at any rate consistent in this mistake. Its origin is no
doubt the fact that the Nile from 21&deg; to 23&deg; S. Lat. flows north-west,
and almost down to Philae (which is about 24&deg;) is a little west in

in a &lsquo;well-equipped&rsquo; native expedition crossing the Sahara and
reaching the Niger, which at its nearest point comes within about

again in iv. 48-50 (where &lsquo;it is the greatest of all rivers that we

It is difficult to see how the Greeks reconciled it with their knowledge 
of the Rhone, but it is suggested that this was looked on as a
southern offshoot of the Danube. Older geographers had made the
Ister rise in the Rhipaean mountains, among the Hyperboreans;

Strabo (169-72) discusses the legends as to them; but Pomponius

that everything in Egypt is the reverse of what it is elsewhere
(&sect; 2). This point is borrowed by Sophocles (O. C. 337 seq.), who
makes Oedipus contrast his daughters and his sons.

<p>[For the relations between H. and Soph. cf. Introd. p. 7]. But
it must be added that there are no verbal similarities in the two
passages. The point is made by other Greek writers, e. g. Anaxandrides 
(Athen. 299), a comic poet circ. 370 B.C., draws an
elaborate contrast between Greece and Egypt; his illustrations
are from the treatment of animals, e.g. <foreign lang="greek">βοῦν προσκυνεῖς, ἐγὼ δὲ θύω
τοῖς θεοῖς</foreign>. It is even more exaggerated later, e.g. by Diod. i. 27 (as
to incestuous marriages). Nymphodorus (a third-century writer,
F. H. G. ii. 380) absurdly puts the topsyturvydom down to Sesostris,
who wished to make his subjects effeminate and so prevent their
demanding liberty.</p>
<p>As so large a part of the details furnished by H. are on religious
matters, it may be worth while to sum up here the main points in
which his account of Egyptian religion is defective or erroneous
(cf. Sourdille, R. pp. 367-401):</p>
<p>(1) It quite fails to bring out the importance of certain cults,
e.g. of Ptah, of R&acirc; (the Sun), of H&acirc;pi (the Nile), of Thoth
(Hermes, who is only mentioned c. 67, <foreign lang="greek">Ἑρμέω πόλις</foreign>), of H&acirc;thor
(Aphrodite).</p>
<p>(2) It has far too much uniformity. H. speaks as if all Egypt
had the same beliefs; &lsquo;but no people is so destitute of the systematic 
spirit as the Egyptians.&rsquo; But cf. 43. 2 n.</p>
<p>(3) The religion is made too Greek:</p>
<p>(<foreign rend="ital">a</foreign>) It is distinctly anthropomorphic; <foreign lang="greek">τὤγαλμα</foreign> is made everywhere 
the centre of the temple worship, and H. seems to have conceived 
of this as usually in human form (46. 2); correspondingly
the theriomorphic character of Egyptian religion is underestimated.</p>
<p>(<foreign rend="ital">b</foreign>) Greek ideas, e. g. of mysteries and oracles, are wrongly
introduced. (Some, however, maintain that the Egyptians really
had mysteries in the Greek sense of the word; cf. 171. 1 n.)</p>
<p>(4) The magic, which is so marked a feature of all Egyptian
religion, is ignored.</p>
<p>On the other hand, H.'s merits as an observer are now recognized. 
Erman, the leading German Egyptologist, writes (R. p. 175):
<pb n="180"/>
&lsquo;Where our Egyptian sources fail us, we receive for the first
time help from outside; about 450 B.C. H., an indefatigable and
careful observer, travelled in Egypt. He observed exactly those
things which are of special interest to us.&rsquo; He proceeds to
sketch later Egyptian religion, mainly from the data given by H.
(pp. 176-81).</p>

<p>H. is struck by the fact that he heard of no women in Egypt
in positions like that of Hera's priestess at Argos, and he (as often)
generalizes from a single point. But he himself knew that there
were women in the temples, cf.<ref target="c.1.182" targOrder="U">i. 182. 5 n.</ref>; ii. 54. 1. He is quite wrong
in his statement; two contrary instances may be quoted; women
under the Old Empire especially devoted themselves to Neith and
Hathor, while under the Saites, the &lsquo;consort of Amon&rsquo; was the
nominal ruler of Thebes.</p>
<p>Wiedemann has a more elaborate explanation. As the Egyptians
called all the dead, men and women alike, &lsquo;Osiris&rsquo;, and made them
male, he thinks that H. was told this, but misunderstood it, and,
transferring it from the other world to the present one, supposed
that no woman could appear before the gods as priestess. Wiedemann 
is very fond of charging H. with confusion; he seems to
estimate the historian's capacity by his own.</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">τρέφειν</lemma> <foreign lang="greek">κτλ.</foreign> Sons at Athens were, as usually in Greece, required

for neglecting this duty (Diog. Laert. i. 55). In Egypt the duty of
seeing to a parent's grave was certainly imposed on sons; the law
in c. 136 implies this. H. is supposed to be referring to the comparative 
independence of Egyptian women (B. M. G. p. 77), who were
<pb n="181"/>
able to incur obligations on their own account; struck by this
contrast to their dependent position in Greece, he states, in an
exaggerated way, that daughters alone had duties to their parents.

Plut. Mor. 352; de I. et O. 4), and it is probable, in view of the
extreme cleanliness of the Egyptians. He is too absolute in
saying that all Egyptians shaved (<foreign lang="greek">τέως ἐξυρημένοι</foreign>); in fact he
himself says (iii. 12. 3) that in few countries are bald men so rare
as in Egypt. Probably some classes, e.g. the priests of the New

(c. Ap. ii. 13) says only the priests. H. (104. 2, 3 nn.) is certainly
wrong in saying that only the Egyptians with the Ethiopians and
Colchians, who had learned it from them, practised the rite <foreign lang="greek">ἀπ’ ἀρχῆς</foreign>;
it was widespread among both Semitic and non-Semitic tribes. Its
primitive nature is shown by the use of &lsquo;flint knives&rsquo; (Exod. iv. 25;
Josh. v. 2, R. V.). Some scholars hold (with H.) that it was introduced 
on sanitary grounds (<foreign lang="greek">καθαρειότητος ἕνεκα</foreign>); but no doubt
originally it was a religious rite, by which a male was initiated as
a full member of the nation or clan (cf. Encyc. Biblica, s. v.). The

marized in Hastings (Enc. Rel. iii. 670-6); the majority of scholars
seem to interpret it as showing that the rite was general in Egypt;
some, however, think it refers only to the priests. It is curious that
only once do the monuments lay any stress on circumcision, i.e. in
describing the repulse of the uncircumcised &lsquo;peoples of the sea&rsquo; by
Merenptah; even here the interpretation is disputed.</p>

Roughly speaking, this is confirmed by the monuments, but only for
members of the lower classes. H. is much too absolute. So far as
men are concerned, he omits the cape introduced under the New
Empire, and he quite fails to notice that the <foreign lang="greek">κιθών</foreign> round the legs
was often worn double (Erman, E. pp. 205-7). As to the Egyptian
women, it is true that they, down to the eighteenth dynasty, wore
only one close-fitting dress; but in H.'s day two, and sometimes
three, garments were worn. The servants and the women in the
fields, however, wore only one (Erman, E. pp. 212-16). It is from
these that H. generalizes.</p></div3>

in drawing the individual signs they usually began on the left (cf.

as a whole, the natives of the formation of each special letter. He
does not mention the older forms of Greek inscriptions, which are
from right to left, or <foreign lang="greek">βουστροφηδόν</foreign>, though he must have seen them.</p>
<p>There were really three kinds of Egyptian writing: (1) The
hieroglyphic, in which the symbols are still recognizable pictures;
this was sometimes from left to right, and sometimes up and down
(like Chinese). (2) The hieratic, a shortened form of this; a few
symbols remain as before, most become purely conventional. (3)
The demotic, which developed still further out of the hieratic, and
was known by the Egyptians as &lsquo;the book script&rsquo;, while the two
first were &lsquo;the Gods' script&rsquo;. The enigmatic, which was invented
under the eighteenth dynasty, is only a way of writing hieroglyphs
in cipher. H. fails to distinguish between (1) and (2), as he well
might.</p>

But certainly the monuments (cf. Erman, E. pp. 198-9) show
an extensive cultivation of vines in Egypt, and certain kinds of its
wines were famous, e. g. the Mareotic (<bibl n="Hor. Carm. 1.37.14">Hor. Odes, i. 37. 14</bibl>). Cf.,
too, Gen. xl. 11; Ps. lxxviii. 47. Probably, therefore, H. is mistaken
in c. 77. Others, however (e. g. Brugsch), accept his statement,
and argue that the monuments belong to a period before H., and
that in his day Greek competition had killed vine-growing in
Egypt. This may be partially confirmed by the present state of

Laertius (viii. 24, 34), in speaking of this Pythagorean abstinence,

is that beans <foreign lang="greek">αἰδοίοις εἰσὶν ὅμοιοι</foreign>. The aversion to beans is supposed
by some to have been derived by Pythagoras from Egypt (cf.
123 nn.); but it is common in many primitive civilizations, e. g. in
India and in early Rome, where beans were supposed to tend to
unchastity, while on the other hand they were especially used in
funeral banquets; cf. Plut. Rom. Quaes. 95, the introduction to which

in iii. 28. 2, 3 (cf. <foreign lang="greek">ἄλλῳ λόγῳ</foreign>, &sect; 2) an account of his origin and marks.
It was from the time of the twenty-sixth dynasty that the Apis-cult
became especially important; under the Ptolemies, as Serapis, he
was the chief god in Egypt. The Greeks identified him with Epaphus, 
son of Zeus and Io (cf. <bibl n="Aesch. PB 850-1">Aesch. P. V. 850-1</bibl>); but, apart from
Aelian's contradiction (Hist. An. xi. 10), this is obviously mistaken.
An account of the Apis is given in Maspero, pp. 37-9. They were
buried in the Serapeum at Memphis, rediscovered by Mariette in
1851-2.</p>
<p>Any beast that bore the same marks, e.g. the &lsquo;black hair&rsquo;
(Plut. I. et O. 31; Mor. p. 363, says &lsquo;white or black&rsquo;), was holy
and could not be sacrificed. So red cattle were properly used as
offerings (cf. Numb. xix. 2, the &lsquo;red heifer&rsquo;); but great freedom
was allowed, as the monuments show. H.'s account is confused; he
seems to mean that no beast could be sacrificed that had black

<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ὁμοίως</lemma>. Various as were the cults of Egypt, Osiris and Isis were
worshipped everywhere, at any rate in later times, i.e. in the days
of H. This was partly due to political influences, i.e. the decline of
Thebes which worshipped Amon, and the rise of Sais, partly to the
confusion of Osiris with the sun-god (cf. Sourdille, R. 58-62). Osiris
was usually identified by the Greeks with Dionysus, but also with
Zeus, Hades, Eros, and other gods. The main points of resemblance
to Dionysus are: (1) Osiris is originally a corn god (cf. Frazer,
Attis, &amp;c. pp. 268 f.; but Egyptologists doubt this); (2) his mutilation 
by Set is parallel to that of Dionysus by the Titans; (3) his

<p>Brugsch says this feast is part of the great festival of the Theban

die when he has begotten a son; Amon therefore, in the form of his
ram, is killed when he has seen his son Heracles. Legrain (R. de

the beast was a goat, and they are confirmed by the nome coins (cf.
B. M. Cat. Alexandria, p. 347); the monuments, however, show the
beast as a ram. Perhaps the monuments are wrong (Sourdille, R.
p. 166); cf. the mistake of representing both wolf and dog by a jackal.</p>
<p>The beast was the incarnation (<emph>not</emph> the symbol as H. thinks; cf.
<foreign lang="greek">οὔτι τοιοῦτον</foreign>) of Osiris, considered as the giver of fruitfulness; so it
is called &lsquo;the lord of maidens, the begetting ox&rsquo;. H. is wrong in
connecting it with Pan; the confusion is due to the fact that Min
of Chemmis (c. 91 n.), whom the Greeks usually identified with
Pan, is goat-headed.</p>

the similarity of Dionysiac worship in Greece and Egypt might be

(<foreign rend="ital">a</foreign>) the Greeks might have borrowed from the Egyptians; (<foreign rend="ital">b</foreign>) the

Cadmus must have known the rites of Egypt, as it was a neighbour

<p>The Cabiri (cf. Daremberg and Saglio, s.v.) are one of the most

seems to have borne the name of <foreign lang="greek">Κάειροι</foreign>. Others connect the name
with a Semitic root = &lsquo;mighty&rsquo;, and derive the Greek Cabiri from
those of Phoenicia, which became familiar to the Greeks as the figureheads 
of galleys. (So Bloch in Rosch. ii. 2540.) But the Phoenician
Cabiri were eight in number, those of Greece vary from two to
four. Probably then the Cabiri belong to the early stages of Greek
religion and are in this sense rightly called &lsquo;Pelasgic&rsquo;. They were
worshipped in many places. e.g. Lemnos, Thebes (cf. Frazer, v. 136
seq., for their temple there), as local genii, subordinate to the
Olympian gods; so H. makes them (iii. 37) the &lsquo;sons of
Hephaestus&rsquo;. But in Samothrace they had remained &lsquo;cosmic deities
of the first rank&rsquo;, and were identified with Hermes and Hephaestus.
As the symbol of the ithyphallic Hermes shows, they were connected
with fruitfulness. Some have identified the Cabiri with the Phoenician

<p>This chapter is most interesting for estimating H.'s own views.
It is clear that: (1) he has definite opinions as to chronology;
Homer and Hesiod are contemporaries and four hundred years
before his own day. (2) He recognizes the importance of Homer
and Hesiod as fixing the canon of Greek mythology. Cf. his
predecessor Xenophanes <foreign lang="greek">πάντα θεοῖς ἀνέθηκαν Ὅμηρός θ’ Ἡσίοδός τε 
οἳ πλεῖστ’ ἐφθέγξαντο θεῶν ἀθεμίστια ἔργα</foreign>. It is not fair to blame H.
(as Strabo does, 43) for not distinguishing the systematic theogony
of Hesiod from the poetic treatment of Homer; this distinction is
irrelevant to his point of view here. (3) He clearly distinguishes
them from the other epic poets (cf. c. 117). But on the other hand
it is equally clear that: (1) his date is his own, not based on
tradition nor universally accepted; (2) he does not realize that
Homer and Hesiod simply gave form to ideas which had been
gradually taking shape before their time, and that they embodied
former lays in their works; (3) still less has he any doubts of the
historic reality of the events described by the poets.</p>
<p>To sum up, his opinions have no objective value for the solution
of the Homeric question, interesting though they are as showing the
ideas of an educated Greek in the fifth century.</p>

<p>Sourdille (H.E. 184) well summarizes the differences between
Greek and Egyptian oracles, of which H. is quite unconscious.
(1) All Egyptian gods, not seven (cf. c. 83) only, could prophesy;
(2) but their responses were for king or priest, as representing the
people, not for all, as in Greece; (3) nor had they a special <foreign lang="greek">μαντεῖον</foreign>,
apart from their ordinary temple. The oracles H. speaks of in
Egypt were those of Greek settlers.</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">χρηστηρίων</lemma>. H. proceeds from the Greek gods to the Greek
oracles; some of these also in Greece he thinks of Egyptian origin.
The story which he gives of the founding of Dodona is a rationalization 
of the myth (given in c. 55). Sayce maintains (J. of P. xiv.
275) that the &lsquo;priests in Thebes&rsquo; that H. talked with were
&lsquo;ciceroni&rsquo; connected with some temple of the Theban Amun in the
north of Egypt, and that H. never was in Thebes itself. Though
there is no reason to doubt H.'s veracity, the story is clearly of Greek
origin; H. may have heard it in Greece, and his guides would
answer in the affirmative all his &lsquo;leading questions&rsquo;; the mention
of &lsquo;Phoenician robbers&rsquo; is certainly more suited to Greeks than to
natives of Upper Egypt. But Sourdille (E. pp. 175-89) thinks that
there was probably a Greek community at Thebes, which had set
up an oracle professing to be that of the Theban god (cf. 57. 3 n.);
to this H. applied, thinking in all good faith that it was native
(cf. the repeated emphasis laid on his informants, 54. 1, 55. 1),
though it was really Greek.</p>
<p>The story as to the &lsquo;priestesses&rsquo; is an attempt to turn myth into
history; it substitutes natural causes for the supernatural ones,
which were, to those among whom the myths grew up, the real
essence of the narrative. For a criticism of such rationalizing in
H. and in Thucydides cf. Grote, i. 381 seq.</p></div>

<p>H. now proceeds (cc. 59-63) to describe six famous festivals:
these were celebrated throughout all Egypt on the same day (62.2);
but every district in Egypt had its special festivals. The fact that
H. says nothing of the festival of the rising of the Nile is urged (Sourdille, 
E. p. 7) with good reason as showing that he arrived in Egypt
after the inundation had begun; cf. 19. 2n.</p>

only six festivals in four years.</p>

(137. 5); cf. also 154. 3 for the planting of the Greek mercenaries
near. The goddess worshipped here was Bast; H. and other
classical writers give her the name of her town, instead of her own.

He wrongly identifies her with Artemis; she had more in common
with Aphrodite, e.g. in the licentious nature of her festival (60. 2).

she has for emblems (on the coins of the Saitic nome) an owl on
her right hand and a lance in her left. Her worship spread widely
under the twenty-sixth dynasty, when Sais was the capital of Egypt.
In her attributes and her representation on the monuments she is
another form of Isis; hence her feast, here described by H., is
a part of the mourning for Osiris (like that at Busiris, c. 61).</p></div3>

the body of Osiris is found with loud shouts. Cf. Juv. viii. 29
&lsquo;Exclamare libet populus quod clamat Osiri Invento&rsquo; (cf. Mayor's
notes for references). The lights, then, are to assist the goddess in
her search; the story is splendidly used by Milton in the Areopagitica, 
where he compares the search for Truth to the search of Isis
for Osiris. Others, however, see in the &lsquo;lights&rsquo; simply a reference
to Osiris as &lsquo;lord of the Sun&rsquo; (B&auml;hr). Brugsch and Sourdille (R
<pb n="197"/>

in the month Choiak, at the time of the winter solstice. Cf. Inscrip.
of Denderah, R. T. E. et A. iii. 49, iv. 27 for the &lsquo;34 boats&rsquo; and
their &lsquo;365 lights&rsquo;. As the feast described by H. is clearly connected 
with Osiris, either of these views is more probable than that
of Maspero (p. 794), that it is the Egyptian &lsquo;All Souls Day&rsquo; (the
17th of Thoth) that is here referred to. The festivals of cc. 61 and
62, though both Osiris feasts, are probably distinct from each other.</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ἐμβάφιον</lemma>: a &lsquo;vessel&rsquo; full of salt steeped with oil; hence the wick

from the moisture it contains by the use of salt (cf. Plin. xv. 25
&lsquo;sine igni et aqua sale aspersum exprimitur&rsquo;).</p>
<p>For the story of Osiris cf. Plut. I. et O. cc. 13-19 and Erman,
R. p. 32 seq. (mainly from Egyptian sources). It is, briefly, as follows 
(the references in H. ii are inserted after each point): Osiris,
the beneficent ruler and civilizer, was killed by his brother Set
(Typhon). (For Osiris' <foreign lang="greek">πάθεα</foreign> cf. c. 171.) His wife, Isis, set out
to search for his body, leaving her son, Horus (Apollo), at Buto to
be protected from Set (c. 156). The body of Osiris was found, but
Set again obtained possession of it, and cut it into fourteen pieces,
which were only rediscovered by Isis after long and patient search
(cf. cc. 47, 48, 62 nn.). Wherever she found a part she erected a
tomb; but the various members were reunited, and restored magically 
to life by the jackal god Anubis. As Osiris, however, could not
rule a second time on earth, he became lord of the other world,
Amenti, &lsquo;the hidden place&rsquo; (cf. cc. 86 n., 123). His son, Horus, after
a long struggle, defeated Set (iii. 5) and reigned in his stead (c. 144)</p>
<p>Almost all these points are referred to by H., but always with
reserve (cf. c. 3 n.). It is noticeable that H. thinks of Osiris as buried
at Sais (c. 171), and never even mentions Abydos in Upper Egypt,
which was especially considered his tomb, and where, accordingly,
wealthy Egyptians had themselves buried, <foreign lang="greek">φιλοτιμουμένους ὁμοτάφους
εἶναι τοῦ σώματος Ὀσίριδος</foreign> (Plut. <foreign rend="ital">u. s.</foreign> c. 20). For the whole Osiris
myth in H. cf. Sourdille (R. c. 3, especially pp. 87-9).</p></div3></div>

<p><hi rend="bold">Buto,</hi> a town in the north-west Delta on the Sebennytic Nile,
was probably near the village of Ibtu; cf. Petrie (E. E. F. xxvi.
(1904-5) pp. 36-8); it was famous for its oracle (cf. cc. 152, 155).
Leto is the Egyptian Uat, the patron deity of the Lower Delta.</p>
<p><hi rend="bold">Papremis</hi> (cf. cc. 71, 165 for the &lsquo;nome&rsquo; of Papremis) was the site
of the battle in 460 B. C., when Inaros defeated Achaemenes (iii. 12.4);
its exact position is uncertain, but Sourdille (E. p. 90 seq.) shows that
probably it was the original native town which was absorbed later
by the Greek Pelusium (so Rhakoti was absorbed by Alexandria).
His arguments, briefly, are: (1) identity of position; Papremis
was on the Egyptian frontier, on or near the Nile (Diod. xi. 74);
H. says Pelusium is &lsquo;the entrance&rsquo; into Egypt from the east (141. 4,
<pb n="198"/>
the story of Sethos); (2) the Coptic name of Pelusium is &lsquo;Peremoun&rsquo;, 
which may well be derived from Papremis; (3) <foreign lang="greek">πηλούσιον</foreign> is
a Greek adjective, and was probably the name of the settlement of
the mercenaries in the territory of Papremis (cf. 165 n.). It is noticeable 
that H. never calls Pelusium a &lsquo;town&rsquo;.</p>
<p>H. says the god worshipped here was Ares (59. 3); whom he
means is uncertain. Some explain &lsquo;Ares&rsquo; as the Egyptian Anhur
(Greek <foreign lang="greek">Ὄνουρις</foreign>), the son of Ra; he stands in Ra's boat, and clears
his course of snakes and hippopotami; his title was &lsquo;foe-smiter&rsquo;.
More probably, however, Ares=a form of Set, i.e. Typhon (Sourdille,
R. p. 188 seq.); for (1) they have a common character of violence.
(2) The hippopotamus, sacred in Papremis only (c. 71), was the
symbol of Typhon (Plut. I. et O. 50); of it the Greeks said <foreign lang="greek">τῇ
μητρὶ βίᾳ μίγνυσθαι</foreign>, which explains the story told by H. below.
(3) Papremis was somewhere in the north-east Delta, near the
Serbonian Lake (cf. <ref target="c.3.5" targOrder="U">iii. 5 n.</ref>).</p>

worshipped by individuals as fetiches. Of this class there is little
evidence, though no doubt such worship was widely spread among
the lower classes; (2) individual animals supposed to be gods

the latter part of the passage is borrowed, in several cases verbally,

the crocodile &lsquo;not moving its under-jaw&rsquo;, and (ib. 9. 6) the account 
of the <foreign lang="greek">τροχίλος</foreign>; the verbal similarities are not so marked in
these passages. In ii. 10 Aristotle inserts most of H.'s other particulars,

eyes and teeth, and as to its claws and skin. In this last passage
the resemblance is again most marked. For the relations of H. and

Hogarth (A. A. L. p. 100) says there is good evidence for one having
been killed there in 1818, and traditions of it still survive in the
marshes. H. is wrong in his negative statement, for it was a sacred
animal in some places, e.g. Thebes, though hated in others as the
symbol of Set (Typhon); there seems no other trace of its connexion 
with Paprensis. Of H.'s description it can at best be said
that it is highly impressionist. The hippopotamus has not a &lsquo;cloven
hoof&rsquo;, nor has it a &lsquo;horse's mane&rsquo; and &lsquo;tail&rsquo; (it really is almost hairless); 
and it is much bigger than an ox. But its teeth are prominent,

<p>The account of the phoenix is one of the passages which Porphyry
says was stolen by H. from Hecataeus (cf. c. 68 n.). The phoenix
is usually said to correspond to the &lsquo;b&obreve;in&rsquo; (or &lsquo;bennu&rsquo;) of Egyptian
theology. It was represented on the monuments as a &lsquo;heron&rsquo;, and
was the symbol of the rising sun, and also of the resurrection. It
was especially reverenced at Heliopolis. Round this symbolic
bird grew up a great mass of myth (cf. e.g. <bibl n="Plin. Nat. 10.2">Plin. N. H.x.2</bibl>; Tac.
Ann. vi. 28). H. reproduces one specimen of this, but expressly
says that he does not believe it. The later and more familiar form
of the story is that the phoenix came to Heliopolis and burned itself
on the altar, and that from the ashes the new phoenix arose; it
was this myth which was used by the Fathers to illustrate the
Resurrection (cf. Clemens Rom. ad Cor. i. 25-6). Manilius (in
Plin. <foreign rend="ital">u. s.</foreign>) connected the life of the phoenix with the &lsquo;great year&rsquo;
(of 540 years), after which &lsquo;significationes tempestatum et siderum

<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">Βουτοῦν</lemma>: this is not the Buto mentioned in cc. 59, 63 (which was
in the North-west Delta). It is doubtfully identified with Amt,
near Tanis, in the North-east Delta (E. E. F. v. 37, for 1888);
<pb n="204"/>
here Uto (Uat) was certainly worshipped. But Sourdille (E. p.
76 seq.) argues ingeniously that the words here show Buto was
outside the Delta (in &lsquo;Arabia&rsquo;) and <emph>off</emph> H.'s main route. He
thinks that H. conceives the serpents as coming from the south,
and turning west, through &lsquo;a pass&rsquo; (<foreign lang="greek">ἐσβολή</foreign>), along the line of the
canal described in 158. 2-3. Hence he places Buto somewhere
near the Bitter Lakes. The &lsquo;great plain&rsquo; of &sect; 2 then is that north
of the Wadi Tum&icirc;l&acirc;t (158. 2 n.).</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">πτερωτῶν</lemma>. The &lsquo;winged snakes&rsquo; are mentioned again in iii. 107 as
guarding the frankincense trees; cf. for the belief in them, Isaiah
xxx. 6, where &lsquo;the viper and the fiery flying serpent&rsquo; are mentioned
among the terrors of the &lsquo;land of trouble and anguish&rsquo; to the south.
Probably the snakes are a reality; Strabo says the region near the
Bitter Lakes was full of serpents, which lay hid in the sand; but
their &lsquo;wings&rsquo; are a mere traveller's tale. Sayce supposes that H.
is trying &lsquo;to give probability and local colouring by telling the tale
in the first person; he compares the valley of the roc in the
Arabian Nights. But H. simply says that he <emph>saw</emph> a number of
snake bones piled up, the rest of the story is what he was <foreign rend="ital">told.</foreign></p>
<p>Other explanations are (1) that of Brugsch, that &lsquo;locusts&rsquo; are
meant. The ibis certainly kills locusts; but in no other point does
the explanation fit H.'s statements.</p>
<p>(2) The story is supposed to have a mythological origin. The
goddess of Buto was represented as a snake with hood inflated and
with wings; but the representation is certainly not that of a &lsquo;watersnake&rsquo; 
nor are its wings &lsquo;like those of bats&rsquo; (76. 3).</p>
<p>(3) Sourdille (E. p. 75) suggests that the tree-lizard of the East,
which has a collar which it expands, was once found in the region
east of Egypt, and may be the &lsquo;winged snake&rsquo;.</p></div3>
<div3 id="c.2.75.3" type="section" n="3">
<p>Whether the sacred ibis really kills snakes or not is disputed; at
all events the Greeks thought that it did. Cf. Diod. i. 87 (also 86)
for this and other explanations of animal worship; he gives a list
of creatures worshipped by the Egyptians because they were useful;
cats and ibises are both mentioned as killing snakes. It need
hardly be said that this explanation of animal worship is an afterthought; 
its origin is to be sought in the superstitions of primitive
peoples (cf. 65. 1 n).</p>
<p>Sourdille (R. p. 251) sums up (with regard to H.'s account of the
worship of animals): &lsquo;the striking point is not the inaccuracy of
the points related; a great number of them agree with what appears
to have been the case; but they are too generalized, too systematized&rsquo;

<p>The Orphic rites spread widely in sixth century Greece;
their popular character, as opposed to the exclusiveness of the old
worships, led to them being patronized by the tyrants; Onomacritus,
&lsquo;the Orphic apostle&rsquo; (Busolt, ii. 364), was a friend of the Pisistratidae
(vii. 6. 3 n.); so too Cleisthenes, tyrant of Sicyon, encouraged the
worship of Dionysus (v. 67. 5), with which the Orphic rites were
closely connected. (Cf. Gomperz, Gk. Thinkers, ii, p. 137.) For
the Orphic doctrines and their relation to those of Pythagoras cf.
Gomperz (ib. caps. 2 and 5; Busolt, ii. 362 seq.): a shorter account
is given by Bury (pp. 311-18). The teaching was at once cosmological 
and religious; the latter is the more important. The
Orphic sect taught the doctrine of metempsychosis (cf. 123. 2 n.);

<p>Embalming was connected with the Egyptian idea as to the

soul, the Ka; the continued existence of this depended on the survival 
of the body; if the body perished, the soul perished. No doubt
the means of preventing this were originally suggested by the dry
air and sand of the desert, which parched the flesh and prevented
decay; then artificial means were invented; Anubis was said to be
their author (cf. Maspero, i. 112, 178 seq.). H.'s account of
embalming is on the whole very accurate; it should be compared
with that of Diodorus (i. 91), which is somewhat fuller, and with
Budge, The Mummy, 1893, pp. 173-84. It may be noted: (1)
Mummied bodies are found exactly as described, some preserved
by bitumen and some by saltpetre. (2) They have a hole bored
from the &lsquo;nostrils&rsquo; (<foreign lang="greek">μυξωτήρων</foreign>) to the brain and an opening in the
&lsquo;flank&rsquo; (<foreign lang="greek">λαπάρην</foreign>). (3) Obsidian or flint knives (<foreign lang="greek">λίθῳ</foreign>) are frequently 
found in graves with mummies; for the use of these
primitive implements in religious ceremonies cf. Josh. v. 2 (R. V.),
&lsquo;knives of flint&rsquo; for circumcision. (4) The linen wrappings and
the &lsquo;wooden figure (<foreign lang="greek">ξύλινον τύπον</foreign>) in form of a man&rsquo; are familiar
in all museums. (5) H. is often too absolute in his statements;
he makes invariable what was only usual. (6) It is curious that
he makes no reference to the Book of the Dead, the formulae
of which were at first inscribed on the coffin, while later the
whole collection was bound up inside the bandages. For the
various forms of this and other funeral literature cf. B. M. G.

such a matter&rsquo;, cf. c. 3 nn. for parallels to, and explanation of, this
religious reserve; Wiedemann thinks H. omits the name &lsquo;because

name from this hero. The whole story is Greek in (1) the idea of
an anthropomorphic god, who leaves his temple and can be traced
by his footsteps; (2) the organized games; (3) the character of
the prizes. There must have been a Greek settlement at Chemmis;
but Maspero's (iii. 649 n.) suggestion that it may really have belonged
to the time of the &lsquo;Philhellene&rsquo; Amasis (cf. Hecat. fr. 286, F. H. G.

<p>Memnon is not the Egyptian king whose musical statue was
famous (cf. <bibl n="Paus. 1.42.3">Paus. i. 42. 3</bibl>; Frazer, ii. 530; Tac. Ann. ii. 61), but the king
of Ethiopia, son of Aurora, who came to help Priam (<bibl n="Hom. Od. 4.188">Od. iv. 188</bibl>;

argues this was not H.'s &lsquo;Royal Road&rsquo;). The original Memnon is
identified by Robertson Smith with Adonis, a god &lsquo;first dead and
then alive&rsquo; (cf. E. H. R., 1887, p. 307), and became the centre of
many strange myths; for the birds at his grave cf. Ael. H. A. v. 1
and Frazer, <bibl n="Paus. 5.387">Paus. v. 387</bibl>. The stories of &lsquo;Memnon&rsquo; belong to
a later stage of mythology, when men placed the Homeric
&lsquo;Aethiopians&rsquo; in Africa; but the name is Egyptian.</p>
<p>If, as is possible, the myth of Memnon is a reflection of a great
Anatolian &lsquo;Hittite&rsquo; empire, the view rejected by H. was correct. The
statue at Karabel certainly resembles those at Boghaz Keui and
elsewhere; it probably is that of the Hittite war-god. The great
Egyptologist, Lepsius, however, like H., thought the figure Egyptian.</p>
<p>Ramsay (H. G. of A. M., p. 60) thinks H.'s topographical details
are impossible, and considers that he never went &lsquo;more than a few
miles from the coast&rsquo; (of Asia Minor), and so had never seen the
monument he here describes; H. had been told there were three
roads to Sardis, viz. from Phocaea, from &lsquo;the Ephesian territory&rsquo;,
and from Smyrna, and that two of them were marked by monuments, 
i. e. the Karabel relief and the &lsquo;Niobe&rsquo;; these three roads
H. confuses and makes into two. This criticism of Ramsay's is not
usually accepted; but even if H. has confused the roads, it does
not follow that he had never traversed them. If Ramsay be right that
H. never left the coast, the historian would be convicted of a serious
<foreign rend="ital">suggestio falsi</foreign>; though he does not say distinctly that he had seen
the Ionian monuments, he certainly implies that he had done so and
that he had traversed the roads.</p>
<p>The whole chapter is most interesting as showing:</p>
<p>(1) The care of H. to use archaeological evidence; (2) his
mixture of accuracy and inaccuracy in the use of it; the latter is
easily explicable, considering the difficulties under which his observations 
were conducted; the figures are high up above the road;
(3) his ignorance of history before the seventh century. He has no
idea of the limitations of Egyptian power, or of the existence of
great Anatolian powers in the past.</p></div3></div>

<p>The <foreign lang="greek">πόλος</foreign> was a concave, hemispherical &lsquo;dial&rsquo;, so called from

by the <foreign lang="greek">γνώμων</foreign> (a &lsquo;pointer&rsquo;), which marked the time of day by its
direction, and the chief seasons of the year (the solstice, equinox,
&amp;c.) by its length at midday. The period from sunrise to sunset
was divided into &lsquo;twelve parts&rsquo;, which of course varied in length
with the season of the year. Diogenes Laertius (ii. 1) says
Anaximander invented the <foreign lang="greek">γνώμων</foreign>: but this need only mean that
he introduced it from Egypt. It is most natural to suppose (cf. D.
of A. <foreign rend="ital">s. v.</foreign> Polus) that H. is speaking of one &lsquo;compound instrument&rsquo;.
Others, however (e. g. D. of A. <foreign rend="ital">s. v.</foreign> Horologium), think that he

Math., pp. 134 seq. (a short paraphrase in Smith, D. B. <foreign rend="ital">s. v.</foreign>
Euclides). According to this (for other evidence cf. Gow, p. 131)
geometry was invented because the Nile floods destroyed all
ordinary boundaries (cf. Strabo 787 for the same statement). Thales

it a science; in Egypt it was confined almost entirely to the practical

<p>H. is supposed to have borrowed this story of Helen in Egypt

(fr. 288). But H.'s account differs in important details; e. g. he does
not mention Pharos (contrast fr. 287), and his story of the slaves
has nothing to do with fr. 318. We know there was a great variety

formed by the termination &lsquo;nitus&rsquo;; this seems to correspond to
the name of Neith, the goddess of Sais (Maspero, Ann. des &Eacute;. G.,

treasuries can still be seen at Med&icirc;net Habu (Baedeker, p. 322).

a popular tale; for the prevalence of robberies of royal tombs

<p>Demeter and Dionysus are Isis (c. 41 n.) and Osiris (cc. 42 nn.,
62. 2 n.). H., having introduced the subject of the world below, brings
in another doctrine as to life after death, which he thought the Greeks
had borrowed from Egypt. Whether metempsychosis was really a
doctrine taught in Egypt is uncertain. Wiedemann rightly says
that it is inconsistent with the preservation of the body by embalming, 
and that the number 3,000 is quite insufficient for Egyptian
ideas; he therefore supposes that H. confused the doctrine of
immortality, which in a certain form (cf. Maspero, M. et A. E. I.
48 seq.) the Egyptians undoubtedly held, with that of metempsychosis, 
and wrongly attributed the latter to Egypt. H. would be
the more likely to do this, as the Egyptians believed the souls of the
blessed could at will take any form they pleased (Sourdille, R. p. 365).
Gomperz (Gk. Thinkers, i. 126-7) considers the doctrine of metempsychosis 
rather Indian than Egyptian, and seems to believe that the
Greeks had been brought into relation with the Indians by their
common subjection to Persia. He also quotes Egyptian doctrines
as to the changes of the soul's abode, which H. may have misunderstood.</p></div3>

<p>The number 3,000 recurs in Plat. Phaedrus, 29, p. 249 A, but
only for the &lsquo;truly philosophic soul&rsquo;. Empedocles, who is certainly
referred to in <foreign lang="greek">οἱ ὕστερον</foreign>, gives &lsquo;30,000 years&rsquo; (<foreign lang="greek">ὧραι</foreign> fr. 115, ed. Diels)
as the period for the purification of sinful souls. By <foreign lang="greek">οἱ πρότερον</foreign> H.
means probably the Orphic teachers (cf. 81. 2 nn.), and certainly
Pythagoras (cf. iv. 95-6). Whether Pythagoras was in this
matter the pupil of Pherecydes, &lsquo;qui primus dixit animos hominum
esse sempiternos&rsquo; (Cic. Tusc. i. 16. 38) is doubtful (cf. Gomperz,
i. 542). H. avoids censuring Pythagoras by name, perhaps because 
he was a Samian (but cf. i. 51. 4 for similar reticence).</p>
<p>The doctrine of metempsychosis was widely diffused in the sixth
century, and it is possible that it may have been taught at Croton
before Pythagoras came there, by the mysterious Orpheus of Croton
(cf. Gruppe, Rosch. Lex. <foreign rend="ital">s. v.</foreign> Orpheus, p. 1131, who accepts H.'s

of the Egyptian people under the pyramid-builders had coloured
tradition as to them. H. as a Greek would be the more ready to
accept the accusation of impiety, because the mere building of such
gigantic masses offended the Greek sense of moderation. Similarly,
in the story in the Papyrus Westcar (now in Berlin), Chufu impiously

<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">μηχανῇσι</lemma>. Petrie writes (<foreign rend="ital">u. s.</foreign> p. 212): &lsquo;for the ordinary blocks
of a few tons each it would be very feasible to employ the method
of resting them on two piles of wooden slabs, and rocking them up
alternately to one side and the other by a spar under the block,
thus heightening the piles alternately, and so raising the stone.&rsquo;
He goes on to show how this method could be applied to the largest
blocks in the pyramid, of fifty tons and upwards. But the explanation 
of Choisy (L'Art de b&acirc;tir chez les &Eacute;gypt., 1904, p. 80 seq., with
pictures and diagrams) is better, viz. that the stones were raised with
&lsquo;ascenseurs oscillants&rsquo;; these resemble in shape the wooden framework, 
used to support temporarily arches in England; ancient models
of them are in the B. M., the Louvre, and at Cairo (cf. App. IX. 4).</p></div3>

<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">εὖ μεμνῆσθαι</lemma>. It can hardly be inferred from this, as some have
done, that H. trusted his memory in his observations, and made no
notes. He only wishes to emphasize the accuracy of a surprising
statement. Diodorus (i. 64) and Pliny here repeat H. Maspero (Ann.
des &Eacute;. G., 1875, p. 18) explains this strange inscription as a prayer
to Osiris, scribbled by an Egyptian tourist, that he might obtain the
blessings of food, &amp;c., and mistranslated by the guide. It would
be a kind of parody of the inscriptions usual on tombs, praying
that Osiris would give (such blessings) to the departed.</p>
<p>It is simpler (with Murray, <foreign rend="ital">u. s.</foreign>, p. 163) to suppose that the royal
inscription was mistranslated; the onion plant was the hieroglyph
for &lsquo;nesut&rsquo; (&lsquo;king&rsquo;), and the papyrus and the lotus were used in
spelling his titles as &lsquo;Lord of Upper and Lower Egypt&rsquo;. But if this
be the explanation, H.'s memory as to the exact place failed him;
there were no official inscriptions on a pyramid, except close to the
entry of the actual tomb-chamber; this one must have been in
a temple near. Some, however, have thought that H.'s guide was
as unable to read hieroglyphics as H. himself, and that he concealed 
his ignorance by a complete invention, which he meant also
to be a joke.</p></div3>

by the monuments (Breasted, A. R. i. &sect; 180) in saying that one of the
three small pyramids near the Sphinx, to the south-east of the
Great Pyramid, is that of the daughter of Cheops; Vyse, 2. 183,
says its workmanship is similar to that of the Great Pyramid.</p>
<p>The rest of the story is a fable, to cast discredit on the
pyramid-builders (cf. i. 93 and ii. 121 for similar stories as to
the &lsquo;Tomb of Alyattes&rsquo; and as to Rhampsinitus). As Maspero
points out (Ann. des &Eacute;. G., 1875, p. 21) the story-tellers of
Memphis took the great names of history and &lsquo;made them odious
and ridiculous&rsquo;. He compares the romance of Setn&eacute; (or Satni)
for a similar motive, i. e. the sacrifice of a woman's honour to
obtain an end otherwise unattainable. In this tale too Rameses II
(under one of his names) and Menephtah both figure, but the latter
has become a distant ancestor instead of a son (ib., 1878, p. 171,
where the story is given almost in full, pp. 142-69). H. himself
may have heard it in Egypt.</p></div>

<p>The Chephr&ecirc;n pyramid is a little larger than H. says. It is
hard to believe that a king who reigned fifty years could be succeeded

unimportant. Maspero (p. 76) suggests that Chephr&ecirc;n was his
brother, and so really the son of Cheops. Manetho (F. H. G. ii. 548)
gives Souphis (= Cheops) sixty-three years, Souphis (= Chephr&ecirc;n)
sixty-six years, Mencheres sixty-three; these figures are absurd;

origin of the story:</p>
<p>(1) It has been held that additions were made to the pyramid by
a later queen (the Nitocris of Manetho, cf. 100 nn.), and that the
Greek fiction as to Rhodopis was a version of the story of her work.</p>
<p>But &lsquo;the Manethonian story of Nitocris and the pyramid is an
impossibility&rsquo; (Hall, J. H. S. xxiv. 208).</p>
<p>(2) It is more probable that we have here an adapted popular
story. The modern Arab tale that the third pyramid was haunted
by a beautiful naked woman, who drove men mad, may easily be
very old; perhaps it is connected with the &lsquo;red painted&rsquo; face of
the Sphinx and its inscrutable smile. This may be the explanation 
of the Greek fiction which we have here, and, in a modified form,
of Manetho's version (cf. 100 nn.).</p>
<p>Rhodopis was a real person; her name seems to have been
Doricha (though Athenaeus, 596, denies this). Greek fancy played

an Ethiopian dynasty ruled in Thebes, though native Egyptian

(725-667 B. C.) of Manetho into a single king, Sabacos (137. 1);
there were at least four kings in it, of whom Shabaka was one; the
last, Tanut-Amen, was expelled by Esarhaddon. Popular tradition
remembered only Sabacos; he seems to correspond to &lsquo;So, king
of Egypt&rsquo; (2 Kings xvii. 4), who incited Hoshea of Samaria to
resist Assyria, and so brought about his destruction. It is needless

name of his town, while Manetho calls him a &lsquo;Saite&rsquo; from his nome
(so the eleventh dynasty is called &lsquo;Theban&rsquo;, though really from Hermonthis). 
(2) It is simpler to suppose that Anysis was not a king, but
only a local chief, like Necho the father of Psammetichus (152. 1).</p>

rapidly fall into ruins, their remains are not removed, but levelled

<p>Caps. 142-6 are a digression, before the history of the twentysixth

he has already made: (1) the antiquity of Egypt (cf. 2. 1 n.); (2) the
obligations of Greece to Egypt for its Pantheon (cf. cc. 49-50 nn.);
(3) the mistaken views of the Greeks as to the human origin of their
gods. The figure 341 H. obtains by calculation, i. e. he counts after
Menes (c. 99) and &lsquo;the 330 kings enumerated from a roll&rsquo; (100. 1 n.),
the 10 kings whose reigns he describes (102-41), i. e. 1 + 330 + 10
= 341. He confirms his calculation by the list of High Priests at
Thebes (143. 2).</p>
<p>The calculation is worthless, for (1) even if we knew the source
of the &lsquo;330&rsquo; and could trust it, many of the kings were contemporary
with each other. (2) H.'s &lsquo;10 kings&rsquo; are counted twice over; they
were already included in the &lsquo;330&rsquo;. (3) It is absurd to suppose
that a king's reign averaged a generation (cf. i. 7. 4 for a lower
estimate). (4) H. knew the priesthood was in his day hereditary

H.'s own views about the sun (cc. 24-5) are quite as impossible.
But H.'s Egyptian informant must have meant something different,
i. e. that from Menes to Sethos there were four &lsquo;Sothis periods&rsquo;

<p>This passage is important as illustrating (1) the fact that H. used
the <foreign lang="greek">Γῆς περίοδος</foreign> of Hecataeus as a guide-book. (2) His somewhat
depreciatory tone to his predecessor. The word <foreign lang="greek">λογοποιός</foreign>, however,
is not itself contemptuous. (3) The origins of Greek chronology

<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ἑκκαιδέκατον</lemma>. The figure seems small; there were twenty

Zeus (vii. 204).</p>
<div3 id="c.2.143.2" type="section" n="2">
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ἐὸν μέγα</lemma>. It is strange that H. only refers in this cursory manner
to the gigantic buildings at Thebes (Karnak); this is one of the
passages used by Sayce to prove that H. never went (p. xxvii) up the
Nile beyond the Fay&ucirc;m. Sayce also affirms (<foreign rend="ital">ib.</foreign> and nn. here) that
the statues seen by H. were at Memphis, not at Thebes; of this he
gives no proof. (For his argument cf. 29 nn.) It may be taken
as certain that H. had never been in the great pillared hall with its
140 columns; only high officials were admitted to this; but he
may well have been in the chambers on the south of the great court.
H. has been partially confirmed by M. Legrain's discovery of a
number of statues at Karnak in 1904 and 1905; over 16,000 objects
were taken out of a pit, of which 600 were statues; only some of
these, however, were of priests, and wood was the exception, not
the rule, as material. Cf. R. de T. xxvii. 67; xxviii. 148. Wood,
however, is a material which perishes easily, and we may accept the
summing up of Sourdille, who (H. E. pp. 190-8) discusses the whole
subject fully, &lsquo;it is at least certain that many priests obtained
<pb n="238"/>
permission to dedicate their statues, that some of these were of
wood, that inscriptions enable to follow for generations the history
of many families&rsquo; (p. 198). H., in fact, as usual, generalizes too much
from data correct in themselves.</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">τοσούτους</lemma>: i. e. 341 (142. 1); H. writes loosely, meaning a number
corresponding to the number of kings. Hecataeus actually would
have seen 345, for he visited Egypt some 140 years (i. e. four generations) 
after the time of Sethos (the 341st king).</p></div3>
<div3 id="c.2.143.4" type="section" n="4">
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">οὐ δεκόμενοι</lemma>: this is too absolute (cf. Sourdille, R. p. 56). The
Pharaohs were by title the &lsquo;sons of Ra&rsquo;, and stories of divine fatherhood 
occur on the monuments, e. g. Amenophis III is son of Amon
at Luxor. H., in fact, contradicts his own statement elsewhere
(cf. i. 182. 1 nn.). In Egyptian, <foreign lang="greek">πίρωμις</foreign> = &lsquo;the man&rsquo;, here wrongly
translated &lsquo;the gentleman&rsquo;. The mistake spoils the point of the
priests' answer, viz. that <emph>mortal</emph> had been born of <emph>mortal</emph>, without
a god coming in, for this long period. Whether the mistake be
due to the interpreter's vanity, or to H.'s desire to outdo the family
distinctions of Hecataeus, must remain uncertain.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Piromis,&rsquo; as a proper name, may have been familiar to H., for
it occurs in an inscription from Halicarnassus, l. 17 (Newton's

But the Turin Papyrus and the monuments alike put immediately
before Menes the &lsquo;Horus worshippers&rsquo; as rulers (Meyer, i. 192),

was identified with Apollo. For his story and that of Osiris cf.

<p>Caps. 145-6 must be read with cc. 43-5; they illustrate (1) H.'s
pseudo-chronology for early times; (2) his fondness for correcting his
countrymen; (3) above all his views on Egyptian religion. He divides
the Egyptian pantheon into three classes, the eight original gods,
the twelve others born from them, and a third series, of indeterminate 
number, born from the twelve. He seems to mean this as a
classification of Egyptian gods in general (145. 1); but if this is
his meaning, he is inconsistent, for he says elsewhere (c. 42) that
only Isis and Osiris were worshipped by all the Egyptians. He
further identifies these gods with the rulers of Egypt before the
period of Menes (<foreign lang="greek">πρότερον τῶν ἀνδρῶν τούτων</foreign>, 144. 2). The origin of
his information may have been chiefly Memphis, for it is the temple
of Ptah (Hephaestus) to which he continually refers (cf. App. X. 10);
but he also refers to Mendes (46. 1). How far Egyptian tradition
really underlies these statements of H. is disputed. Brugsch
(Religion der Alten A. p. x) explains the &lsquo;eight&rsquo; as corresponding
to the eight original &lsquo;cosmogonic&rsquo; deities, while the &lsquo;twelve&rsquo; are
<pb n="239"/>
made up by the addition of Thoth, the &lsquo;thought&rsquo; of the original
god personified, and of the divine Triad of Toum, Hathor, and
Harpocrates (the father, mother, and son). H.'s third series of
gods he explains as local gods, to whom &lsquo;special worships were
founded after the pattern of the cosmogonic twelve (p. xi).</p>
<p>It will be seen at once that, if this were the real Egyptian
view, H. has reproduced it very inaccurately; but Maspero
(M. A. E. ii, pp. 184-7, 237 seq.) rejects Brugsch's whole system
as &lsquo;an attempt to get from polytheistic texts a monotheistic
theology&rsquo;. It must suffice to say here (1) that the usual division of
the Egyptian pantheon was into three &lsquo;nines&rsquo;, of which the first
was far the most important; the &lsquo;enneads&rsquo; of Heliopolis were the
best known; (2) that H. is wrong in putting Osiris in his third
class (c. 145); he belonged to the great &lsquo;ennead&rsquo;; (3) that he is
right, according to Egyptian ideas, in making the gods to have
been rulers of Egypt.</p>
<p>Sourdille (cap. 2) criticizes H.'s views on Egyptian religion generally; 
he sums up: &lsquo;H.'s starting-point is really Egyptian (e. g. the
threefold division), his development rests on conceptions entirely
different&rsquo; (p. 54).</p>

the one hand and of Dionysus and Pan on the other were not
parallel (<foreign lang="greek">κατά περ Ἡ. κτλ</foreign>.). Heracles (c. 43) was the son of Amphitryon, 
who after a long life had been identified with an Egyptian
god; but as to Pan and Dionysus, their stories (&sect; 2) showed they
had never existed as men. They had not become &lsquo;famous&rsquo;
(<foreign lang="greek">φανεροί</foreign>) like Hercules, and so &lsquo;taken the names of gods who had
existed before&rsquo;. The Greeks therefore, he thinks, borrowed them
from Egypt, and made the date of the introduction of their worship
(<foreign lang="greek">ἀπ’ οὗ ἐπύθοντο κτλ</foreign>.) into the date of their birth. Stein ingeniously
shows that this actually was done in the worship of Dionysus;
Melampus, its mythical founder (49. 3), was a contemporary of
Labdacus; for their respective great-grandsons, Amphiaraus (cf.
<bibl n="Hom. Od. 15.241">Od. xv. 241</bibl> seq.) and Polynices, were both among the &lsquo;Seven
<pb n="240"/>

pre-hellenic palace of Knossus; as there was a direct connexion
between Minoan civilization and the twelfth dynasty culture, the
Greeks were justified in their comparison.</p>
<p>The building here described by H. (also by Strabo 811) was
originally built by Amenemh&ecirc;t III (101. 4 n.), and was continued by
his daughter (queen 1791-1788); only their names have been found
among the ruins, and no trace of the work of the twenty-sixth
dynasty. H. is therefore wrong in attributing it to the &lsquo;twelve
kings&rsquo;; but most classical writers are also wrong (e. g. Strabo).
Manetho (fr. 35; ii. 560), however, rightly gives it to a king of the
twelfth dynasty, calling him &lsquo;Lamares&rsquo; which seems to be one of
<pb n="241"/>
the names of Amenemh&ecirc;t III (cf. Meyer, i. 281 n.). The &lsquo;Labyrinth&rsquo;
was considered one of the &lsquo;seven wonders of the world&rsquo;; it was
not only a temple, but also the seat of government; each nome had
its own set of chambers in it.</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">Κροκοδείλων ... πόλιν</lemma>. For this town cf. 69. 1. It lies close to the

<p>The chief differences between the accounts of H. and of Strabo are:</p>
<p>(1) H. says there were twelve <foreign lang="greek">αὐλαί</foreign>, Strabo (787, 811) implies
there were more&mdash;one for each of thirty-six nomes; but he also
seems to give the number as twenty-seven.</p>
<p>(2) H. says the &lsquo;courts&rsquo; had &lsquo;openings facing each other&rsquo; (&sect; 4),
Strabo that they were <foreign lang="greek">ἐφ’ ἕνα στίχον</foreign>, and that they opened on a
long wall.</p>
<p>(3) H. says nothing distinct (but cf. &sect; 7) of the absence of wood
or of the monolithic roofs, Strabo nothing of the &lsquo;underground
chambers&rsquo; (&sect; 5).</p>
<p>It would be impossible to construct a building according to the
description of either H. or Strabo; and it is obvious that a
&lsquo;labyrinth&rsquo; defies description, at any rate by a mere visitor led
through part of it as was H. (&sect; 5). It is therefore needless to
attempt to account for the contradictions, &amp;c., by supposed later
additions to the Labyrinth during the 450 years between the visits
of the two travellers.</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">κατάστεγοι</lemma>. The courts were &lsquo;covered in&rsquo;, not open as usual;
H. conceives them as arranged six a side, along a corridor, from
which, being no doubt higher, they were lighted. Stein compares
the pillared hall at Karnak, where also the walls and pillars are
covered with &lsquo;figures carved on&rsquo; (<foreign lang="greek">τύπων ἐγγεγλυμμένων</foreign> (&sect; 7); cf.
136. 1). H. is right that the main feature of the building was the
great number and the equal size (speaking generally) of its chambers;
there was not the usual great central court, for it was not dedicated
to any one deity (cf. Petrie, <foreign rend="ital">u. s.</foreign> p. 7).</p></div3>

<p>Lake Moeris (for the name cf. 101 n.) &lsquo;was the natural basin of
the Fay&ucirc;m oasis, regulated and utilized by Amenemh&eacute;t III&rsquo; (Petrie,
i. 192, with whom Breasted, pp. 193-4, agrees). The Fay&ucirc;m in
its lowest parts is over 120 feet below the sea level, and was
originally filled with water by the Nile; some parts of it, however,
e. g. the site of Arsinoe, were inhabited even under the Old
Empire, and more of it was reclaimed by the great kings of the
twelfth dynasty, especially Amenemh&ecirc;t III. He also regulated the
flow of the Nile, using the lake to hold the surplus of the high
Nile, and then letting the water go as it was wanted. In fact his
work was an anticipation of the Barrage and the dam at Assouan.
Owing to the rise in height of the Nile valley on the east side, Lake
Moeris gradually became useless for controlling the Nile flood, but
the work of reclamation was greatly extended under the Ptolemies.
Only the Birket Kar&ucirc;n is now left, on the north-west of the district;
this lake is thirty-four miles long.</p>
<p>The topography of Lake Moeris was finally settled by Major
Brown (The Fay&ucirc;m and L. M., 1892); for a good summary cf.
Grenfell and Hunt, Fay&ucirc;m Towns (E. E. F., 1900, pp. 1-17); they
say H.'s &lsquo;mistakes, such as they are, are those of an uncritical eyewitness&rsquo;; 
while Strabo, on the other hand, claims to have seen what
bad ceased to exist 200 years before his time (p. 8).</p>
<p>Other views of Lake Moeris are briefly: (1) that of Linant
(published 1843), who first explored the district, that Lake Moeris
was on the east side of the Fay&ucirc;m, held up by huge dykes. This,
though long accepted, is now given up. (2) Maspero (p. 131) and
Meyer (i. 293) both deny that the lake had anything to do with the
regulation of the Nile flood. It will be noticed that H. says nothing
as to this.</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ἑξακόσιοι καὶ τρισχίλιοι</lemma>. This figure&mdash;about 400 miles&mdash;is much

of Amenemh&ecirc;t III, probably about 39 feet high, or, with their
pedestals, 60 feet. H. had only seen the statues from Arsinoe

in Assurbanipal's Annals (R. P.<hi rend="sup">1</hi> i. 57 seq.; B. M. G. A. pp. 221-2,

Esarhaddon in Egypt (ib. 61); they were expelled by Taharka, but

Sabacos (Shabako) died before 700. Necho really fell before Tanut
Amen, who shared the power of Taharka, the last of the four

Assyria as her immediate neighbour; now that power was breaking
up, it was the policy of the Saites to extend their influence over
Syria. The length of the siege, however, is a difficulty; it has
been explained as a confusion in tradition, i.e. Psammetichus is
made to take after &lsquo;twenty-nine years&rsquo; the town which he really
took in the twenty-ninth year of his reign. But this is pure conjecture,

the Assyrian weakness caused by the Scythian inroad (i. 105 n.),

<p>The Nile canal was first made by Sethos I (nineteenth dynasty,

the scenes in the hall at Karnak. It had, however, silted up by
Necho's time. The work of Darius is confirmed by inscriptions
(Hogarth, A. and A. p. 184) found between the Bitter Lakes and
the Red Sea; Darius says, &lsquo;I ordered to dig this canal from the
Nile which flows in Egypt to the sea which begins with Persia.
This canal was dug&rsquo; (Weissbach and Bang, 1893; Die Alt-Pers.
Keilinsch. p. 39; Meyer, iii. 60 adopts this view); the inscription
was formerly translated in the opposite sense, to mean that Darius
gave up his work (so Pr&aacute;&sbreve;ek, ii. 111). The canal was again
rendered navigable under the Ptolemies, and with some variation of
direction by Trajan (but this is uncertain); it finally was closed in
the eighth century A. D. The remains of the canal at Belb&ecirc;s show

the Jewish historian probably misinterpreted the prophecies (cf.

in a fragmentary inscription (for which cf. 27. 2 n.), mentions a
campaign, perhaps victorious, against Amasis in 568 B. C., and
Wiedemann thinks that Egypt was overrun by the Chaldaeans as

open (as by Meyer, i.<hi rend="sup">1</hi> 497); on the one hand the silence of H. as
to such a defeat is easily explicable by the vanity of his Egyptian

a matter of fact there was no strict division of hereditary castes;
members of the same family could belong to different classes. But
it is true that certain functions were hereditary (e. g. Brugsch

at this period), and that the &lsquo;soldiers&rsquo; and the &lsquo;priests&rsquo; were
separated from the mass of the people; so too were certain

altogether bear out this division, e. g. that of Nathos is placed by
Stein in the Egyptian Delta. It is impossible to settle the question,
for several of the nomes are differently identified, e.g. those of
Chemmis and Papremis (63. 1 n. and iii. 12), and some names in

<p>Three points as to the division are probable: (1) it did not include

rejected that the name <foreign lang="greek">Λαβαρεῖς</foreign>, given by Aristagoras (Steph. Byz.

that it lasted till Persian times, cf. ix. 32. 1 for the divisions in

Northern Egypt. &lsquo;Thebes&rsquo; (166. 1) alone represents Upper Egypt.

Draco made death the punishment for <foreign lang="greek">ἀργία</foreign>, and that Solon, here

legislation, as shown in his law that all sons were to be taught a
trade (Plut. Sol. c. 24); but if it had anything to do with him, it
could not have been borrowed from Amasis, who became king
570 B. C., more than twenty years after Solon's legislation (cf.
App. XIV. 6). There was a law against idleness later at Athens

<p>In this chapter (as in c. 154) there is a contradiction as to the
policy of Amasis; he gains the throne at the head of a native reaction,
and yet is a &lsquo;philhellene&rsquo;. Probably both aspects of his policy are
true, and their fundamental and inevitable inconsistency ruined at
once his reputation (cc. 172-4 nn.) and his country; the Saites
depended on foreign arms to defend Egypt (iii. 11), and yet these
very defenders were hated by the Egyptians. It may be added that
H. probably derived much information from the Greeks of Naucratis;
to them at any rate Amasis was an undoubted benefactor.</p>
<p>Among the Hellenic friends of Amasis were Solon (cf. 177),
Polycrates (iii. 39), and Pythagoras (introduced to him by Polycrates), 
Diog. Laert. viii. 1. 3.</p>
<div3 id="c.2.178.1" type="section" n="1">
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ἔδωκε Ναύκρατιν</lemma>. This passage raises two distinct questions:
(1) Did the Greeks settle at Naucratis before the time of Amasis?
(2) When did H. think they settled there?</p>
<p>To take (2) first. This passage by itself might mean that the
colony at Naucratis dated from Amasis; many, e. g. Hogarth (B. S. A.
<pb n="254"/>
v. 46), think this the &lsquo;natural interpretation&rsquo;. But H. (135. 1, 5)
implies the earlier presence of a Greek community at Naucratis,
and his whole story of the Saites implies that the Greeks had free
access to Egypt before the limitations of Amasis. H.'s authority
then is at least doubtful as to the date of Naucratis.</p>
<p>As to (1) Strabo (801) says <foreign lang="greek">πλεύσαντες ἐπὶ ψαμμητίχου τριάκοντα ναυσὶ

be a piece of genuine tradition, that Miletus took a prominent part
in assisting Psammetichus; Inarus would be one of his rivals,
possibly one of &lsquo;the dodecarchy&rsquo;. For further evidence that
Miletus founded Naucratis cf. Athen. vii. 283; for the Greeks in
Egypt before Amasis cf. c. 154 nn. and Steph. Byz. <foreign rend="ital">s. v.</foreign> <foreign lang="greek">Ἑλληνικόν</foreign>.</p>
<p>The archaeological evidence is variously interpreted. Petrie and
E. A. Gardner, who explored the site in 1884-6, held that the early
date was proved, E. E. F. 1886-8, Naucratis; cf. P. Gardner,
N. C. G. H. pp. 187 seq.; on the other hand, Hogarth, who resumed
the digging in 1899, maintains that nothing had been found inconsistent 
with the later date, of about 570 B. C., which Hirschfeld and
others had always maintained on epigraphical evidence (for this cf.
Roberts, Greek Epigraphy, pp. 159 seq., 323 seq.).</p>
<p>The site of Naucratis was conclusively identified by Petrie at
Neb&icirc;reh on a canal from the Canopic Nile, outside the Delta.</p></div3>
<div3 id="c.2.178.2" type="section" n="2">
<p>The Hellenion was identified by Petrie with an enclosure capable

quarter of the town, and was probably a native fort to overawe the

<p>The law that the Persian king should only marry from the
families of &lsquo;the Seven&rsquo; (84. 2 n.) may not yet have been passed;
but Amasis knew his daughter would be regarded as a sort of
captive; the chief wives were always Persian. The story that
Cambyses was the son of an Egyptian princess was given by Dinon
(fl. circ. 360 B. C.) and Lyceas of Naucratis (F. H. G. ii. 91; iv. 441);
that of H. in cap. 1 is even more incredible; a daughter of Apries
would have been at least 40 in 529 B. C.; Ctesias (fr. 8, p. 225) for
once agrees with H. The story of c. 2 is due to the vanity of a
conquered nation (as H. saw), claiming a share in its conqueror
(cf. App. IV. 4); but all the variants are probably derived from
Egyptians, who wished that their own country should have a share
in suggesting its own conquest. The princess is the heroine of
Ebers' famous romance, Eine &auml;egyptische K&ouml;nigstochter.</p></div>

the same of Phoenicians. Either the neighbouring tribes had

<p>According to the inscription on a statue (the Naophorus) in the
Vatican, set up by Uza-hor-ent-res, admiral of Amasis and Psammetichus 
III (R. P. x. 49; cf. Petrie, iii. 361-2), Cambyses at first
paid respect to the goddess Neith, cleansed her temple, and restored
her revenues, which had been alienated for the Greek mercenaries.
This was a reversal of the policy of Amasis (ii. 154 n.), and along
with the outrage on his mummy was an appeal to the party in
Egypt which had hated him. It was also the usual Persian policy
towards the religion of subject peoples. Cf. Cyrus in Babylon
(C. C. 27 seq. in R. P.<hi rend="sup">2</hi> v. 167), and also his attitude towards the
Jews (2 Chron. xxxvi. 23).</p>
<p>This inscription, however, is not inconsistent, as some maintain,
with H.'s story of the outrage on Apis (c. 29), which took place
after the disastrous expedition against Ethiopia; it speaks of a period
of &lsquo;great woe in all the land&rsquo;, and Uza-hor-ent-res himself left Egypt
(perhaps fleeing from Cambyses), and was recalled by Darius
(&sect; 7). Moreover, panegyrics on a monarch's piety are apt to be
misleading (cf. &lsquo;our most religious and gracious King, George IV&rsquo;,
though the parallel is only a partial one). Maspero, therefore (iii.
668 seq.), accepts H.'s narrative as to Cambyses (as does also
Meyer, i.<hi rend="sup">1</hi> 508 doubtfully); but it is rejected by many as due to
Egyptian hatred of their conqueror; Duncker (vi. 170) argues that
Egypt would never have remained quiet, had its religion been
outraged thus. (See further c. 29 nn. and App. V. 3.)

<p>The &lsquo;long-lived Ethiopians&rsquo;, as described by H., are a mythical
people (cf. c. 20). His account of them is partly based on Homer

Zeus (Il.) and Poseidon (Od.) go to feast), partly on travellers' tales
(c. 18); its exaggeration is natural, as they live at the end of the
world to the south-west (iii. 114); so they are &lsquo;the tallest and
fairest of men&rsquo; (cf. the beauty of Memnon and <foreign lang="greek">ἀμύμονες</foreign>, <bibl n="Hom. Il. 1.423">Il. i. 423</bibl>;
<bibl n="Hom. Od. 11.522">Od. xi. 522</bibl>). The tradition of the Egyptian priests would agree
with this; Napata was the seat of a strict theocracy; cf. <bibl n="Diod. 3.5">Diod. iii. 5</bibl>
for the priestly control of the Ethiopian kings. But the Ethiopians

easily turned into a fact, as food was actually left on the tombs
(Maspero, iii. 667 n.). The informants of H. give this myth a
Greek colouring by bringing in the sun, and he is the more ready

<pb n="263"/>
of Thebes, &lsquo;seven days&rsquo; journey' away (the figure is fairly right).
For the oases cf. iv. 181 nn. H., however, is hopelessly confused;
the Oasis of Ammon, that of Siwah (cf. ii. 32; iv. 181. 2 nn.),
was much further north, in the latitude of the Fay&ucirc;m, from which
it could be reached in fourteen days. It is most unlikely that the
Persians attacked it from the &lsquo;Great Oasis&rsquo;. Perhaps H. had heard
of the small oasis, which lies near the &lsquo;Great Oasis&rsquo;, and confused
it with that of Siwah. St. Martin, pp. 40-1.</p>
<p>As to the nature of the &lsquo;Aeschrionian tribe&rsquo; it is impossible to
speak definitely. The Etym. Mag. (<foreign rend="ital">s. v.</foreign> <foreign lang="greek">Ἀστυπάλαια</foreign>) speaks of two
tribes, the Astypalaean and the Schesian, which may be parallel to
the &lsquo;Aeschrionian&rsquo;; certainly <foreign lang="greek">Αἰσχρίων</foreign> is found as a proper name
at Samos. On the other hand, the four Ionic tribes (v. 66. 2 n.)
were almost certainly found there; two of them occur at Perinthus,
a colony of Samos (Busolt, i. 279 n.). It is very curious to find
Greeks 400 miles from the sea, and Dahlmann thinks H. is misled by
some similarity of sound: it is safer, however, to accept so definite
a statement about emigrants from a city which H. knew well
(cf. Introd. p. 3 and iii. 60 nn.).</p>
<p>Strabo (791) compares oases to islands, and the familiar legend
of the &lsquo;isles of the blest&rsquo; might well occur to a Greek traveller.
But Spiegelberg (Z. A. S. 42. 85-6) has shown that H.'s derivation is
meant to translate an Egyptian word, though it is inaccurate,
and that it was derived from a native. Maspero (M. et A. E.

a very old Egyptian one.</p></div3>

reject the story altogether, because an Apis <foreign lang="greek">στήλη</foreign> (No. 354 in the
Louvre) represents Cambyses as adoring the bull-god; this belongs
to the sixth year of his reign. Maspero (iii. 668 n.), however,
accepts H.'s story. Wiedemann (Gesch. Aeg., 1880, p. 229) argues
that the faulty execution of the Apis monument just mentioned
shows it was executed secretly by the priests; moreover, its evidence
is contradicted by another Louvre &lsquo;column&rsquo;, set up under Darius
to commemorate an Apis born in the fifth year of Cambyses; he
(p. 230) conjectures that this second monument was deliberately
antedated, so as to ignore the cruel death of the last Apis; this
hypothesis is probable, because it explains how two sacred bulls
could be represented as existing at once, a thing in itself impossible.</p></div>

Smerdis for five years, by arrangement of Cambyses, and then seize

146. 2, and for the Heraeum, Introd. &sect; 25, p. 30). The connexion
of events in Samos, however, with the course of Persian history was
closer than H. suspected; Amasis had endeavoured to protect
Egypt, in accordance with the usual policy of the Saite dynasty,
by forming a league of maritime states; but the desertion of Cyprus
and the submission of Phoenicia to the Persians (19. 3 n.) changed
the balance of power, and Polycrates went over to the side of the
stronger. H. ignores the real reasons of the policy of Polycrates,
and gives us instead a story illustrating the Nemesis attendant on
good fortune (cc. 40-3), which hides the treachery of Samos. But

Maeandrius (cf. Myres, J. H. S. xxvi. 91, 101, for slightly different

Diodorus (i. 95) rationalizes the story by making Amasis break off
the alliance because he (Polycrates) dislikes tyranny. Reinach

Sicyon a reflection of the political grouping of the fifth century

<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ὄρυγμα</lemma>. The object of the &lsquo;tunnel&rsquo; was to bring the water from
the other (i. e. the north) side of Mount Ampelus; the &lsquo;channel&rsquo;
in it (<foreign lang="greek">ἄλλο ὄρυγμα</foreign>) is not quite &lsquo;thirty feet&rsquo; deep at the outlet, and
decreases in depth as it approaches the spring from which it issues;
this was to give sufficient fall for the water, but H. had of course
only seen the outlet on the south side; as the boring was begun
on both sides, the engineering skill required was very considerable.
The work is a good instance of the way in which the tyrants
&lsquo;courted popularity by providing for the needs of their people&rsquo;,
and may be compared with the contemporary aqueduct of Pisistratus 
(cf. E. Gardner, Athens, pp. 26-7). The tunnel was discovered
<pb n="273"/>
in 1882 (cf. Mittheil. des Deutsch. Archaeol. Instit. 1884 (Athen.),
pp. 163 f., with two plans, or Tozer's Islands of Aegean, pp. 167 seq.).
On the whole the accuracy of H. is strikingly confirmed, though he
exaggerates the length of the tunnel, which is really about 1,100
feet.</p></div3>
<div3 id="c.3.60.2" type="section" n="2">
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">σωλήνων</lemma>. Remains of the &lsquo;pipes&rsquo; have been found, both leading

<div3 id="c.3.60.3" type="section" n="3">
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">χῶμα</lemma>. The mole extended from the western horn of the Old
Harbour and more than half closed it. Its remains can still be
seen about six feet below the surface. H. is right as to its length,
but the sea at present is only ten fathoms deep (Gu&eacute;rin,
pp. 203-4).</p></div3>
<div3 id="c.3.60.4" type="section" n="4">
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">νηὸς μέγιστος</lemma>. H. means of Greek temples: those of Egypt were
larger. The Heraeum was 346 feet long and 189 broad (Leake,
Asia Minor, p. 348, makes it 350, but other estimates are given;
Gu&eacute;rin, p. 225), which is larger than any known Greek temple in
the East, except that of Ephesus, which was finished later; H.
(ii. 148) mentions these two temples as &lsquo;notable&rsquo; Greek works.
The temples at Acragas and Selinus are about the same size;
the Olympieium at Athens was on a larger scale, but remained
unfinished till the time of Hadrian. Pausanias (vii. 5. 4) says the
Heraeum was &lsquo;burned down&rsquo; (<foreign lang="greek">κατακαυθῆναι</foreign>) by the Persians, but
that <foreign lang="greek">θαῦμα ἦν ὑπὸ τοῦ πυρὸς λελυμασμένον</foreign>.</p>
<p>For Rhoecus cf. Murray, G. S. i. 74 seq.; he was connected with
Theodoros (i. 51. 3 n.). His name has been found on a sixth-century
vase at Naucratis. He probably began the temple half a century
before, and it was finished under Polycrates. For these <foreign lang="greek">ἔργα
Πολυκράτεια</foreign> cf. <bibl n="Aristot. Pol. 5.1313b.24">Arist. Pol. 1313 b 24</bibl> who says they were intended
to produce <foreign lang="greek">ἀσχολία καὶ πενία τῶν ἀρχομένων</foreign>; he does not mention 
the desire to provide wages for the poorer classes, though
no doubt this motive was present with ancient (cf. Pl. Per. 12) as
well as with modern despots. Aristotle compares them with the
Pyramids and with the buildings of the Cypselidae and the Pisistratidae. 
The building policy of tyrants from the days of Cypselus
to Napoleon III's &lsquo;Haussmannization&rsquo; of Paris is a commonplace of
history. The Samian Alexis says (F. H. G. iv. 299) that Polycrates
also developed the agricultural wealth of his island. For his commercial 
and industrial activity cf. Ure in J. H. S. xxvi. pp. 132-3.</p></div3></div>

<p>As to the list it should be noted (1) that H. gives all the names
right except Aspathines, who seems to be Aspachana, the quiverbearer 
of Darius (cf. Nakhsh-I-Rustam Inscrip.); (2) that Ctesias
has only one right, Hydarnes, and that in two cases (Onophas and
Mardonius) he gives the names of their sons (cf. Gilmore, Ctes. p. 148
for an attempted explanation); (3) that the families of all the conspirators 
except Intaphrenes (for obvious reasons) are prominent
in the later history.
<pb n="276"/></p>
<p>Some have maintained (e.g. Niebuhr) that H. is wrong in making
the number seven an accident; the Seven were the heads of the
great Persian families, who naturally took the lead in a &lsquo;national
movement&rsquo;. So later we have the &lsquo;seven counsellors&rsquo; (Ezra vii. 14),
and the seven princes of Persia who &lsquo;saw the king's face&rsquo; (Esther i.
14). But the coincidence of the number &lsquo;seven&rsquo; is probably an
accident (cf. for other &lsquo;sevens&rsquo; iii. 14 n. and Esther i. 10, the &lsquo;seven
chamberlains&rsquo;), for</p>
<p>(1) It is hard to see how the number of the &lsquo;counsellors&rsquo; could
have been maintained when one of the conspirators (Darius) had
been raised to the throne, and another (Intaphrenes, iii. 119) attainted.</p>
<p>(2) Plutarch (Praec. Reip. Ger. c. 27, Mor. 820) says the conspirators' 
descendants had the right to wear the upright tiara, the
royal badge; but he attributes this to their part in the conspiracy.</p>
<p>(3) Darius in the B. I. seems to imply that the number was
fortuitous. He adds &lsquo;a Persian&rsquo; to the name of each conspirator;
but this is to lay stress on the national character of the movement,
not to show that the men were especially privileged.</p>
<p>H. therefore is probably right on this point, though the &lsquo;seven
counsellors&rsquo; may well be a real institution, and though the descendants 
of the conspirators were rewarded with great privileges
(84 n.).</p></div3>

following days in lawlessness&rsquo;, in order to learn how evil <foreign lang="greek">ἀνομία</foreign>
was. This custom, if a fact, may be referred to here; but Sextus
Empiricus is probably giving a mere inference from H.</p>
<p>The discussion of the conspirators which follows (cc. 80-2) is most
important in three respects.</p>
<p>A. <hi rend="bold">Its bearing on the composition of H.'s work.</hi></p>
<p>(1) He refers to criticisms on it (VI. 43); hence it has been inferred
that Book III was written and published before Book VI (cf. Introd.
p. 13 n.). The more probable inference, however, is that H. went
on adding to his work after parts of it had become known to the
public.</p>
<p>(2) It is quoted as proof of the theory that H.'s history is partly
a compilation from the works of previous authors (cf. 46. 2). Maass
(Hermes, xxii. 581 seq.) thinks that the arguments are borrowed
from a sophistic dialogue, probably one of the &lsquo;negative arguments&rsquo;
(<foreign lang="greek">καταβάλλοντες λόγοι</foreign>) of Protagoras, and that the same source was
used by Isocrates (Nicocles, 14 seq.). The resemblances, however,
between H. and Isocrates are merely accidental, and Meyer (F. i.
201-2) completely demolishes the theory; he sums up (cf. 81. 2 n.)
&lsquo;Maass makes H. a simpleton if he imagines that he could impose
on the public inventions of his good friend Protagoras as historical
facts&rsquo;.</p>
<p>B. <hi rend="bold">The historical reality of the facts.</hi></p>
<p>H. vouches for this in the strongest way, &lsquo;they were said, in spite
of all objections&rsquo; (<foreign lang="greek">δ’ ὦν</foreign>).</p>
<p>Probably H. is following the account of a Hellenized Persian (cf.
J. H. S. xxvii. 40); the questions actually discussed were&mdash;&lsquo;Should
the Persians revert to the natural condition of the old Iranian society,
and let all clans live under their immemorial customs?&rsquo; or &lsquo;should
they continue the centralized monarchy?&rsquo; i.e. the liberty claimed
<pb n="278"/>
was simply the rights of the great nobles (cf. Mahaffy, G. L. ii. 32 n.,
and on the Oriental idea of &lsquo;Liberty&rsquo;, Beavan, House of Seleucus,
i. 3 seq.).</p>
<p>C. <hi rend="bold">The passage is the beginning of Greek political philosophy.</hi> 
(Cf. Freeman's Sicily, iii. 644 seq., for the threefold division
of constitutions and early references to it.) H. here, as always,
clothes Persian ideas in the phrases of his own countrymen (cf.
i. 96, the story of Deioces), as all men of genius do, e. g. Shakespeare's 
Venetians are Elizabethan Englishmen and Racine's
Greeks are courtiers of Le Grand Monarque. It is against this
arbitrary introduction of speeches that Thucydides (by implication)
protests in i. 22. 1; his own speeches he claims were appropriate

Rawlinson (on ii. 8) is probably right in putting these Arabians
between the Nile and the Red Sea. H.'s statement here as to
Arab independence (cf. iii. 7 seq.) refers to a different set of tribes,
i. e. the nomads to the south and east of Palestine. The Persians,
wiser than the Assyrians, did not attempt to conquer the wild
tribes of the desert, but made friends with them. The Arabs had
pressed north, as early as the fifth century, into the regions desolated
by the Assyrian raids. (Meyer, iii. 86 seq.) They controlled the

<p>H. only here and in i. 192. 2 uses <foreign lang="greek">σατραπηίη</foreign>, in both cases with an
explanation (<foreign lang="greek">ἀρχή</foreign>); his usual word is <foreign lang="greek">νομός</foreign>. Aeschylus uses no
form of the word at all, and Thucydides only <foreign lang="greek">σατραπεία</foreign>; Xenophon

<foreign lang="greek">σατράπης</foreign>, i.e. &lsquo;Kh&scaron;&aacute;trap&acirc;van&rsquo;, is found twice in the B. I. and seems =
&lsquo;upholder of the crown&rsquo;: it is found first in Sargon's list of Median
chiefs, apparently as a proper name. The office existed before
Darius; cf. B. I. <foreign rend="ital">u. s.</foreign>; i. 153. 3 (Tabalus); iii. 120 (twice, Oroetes
and Mitrobates); iii. 70. 3 (Hystaspes) and iv. 166 (Aryandes).
The innovation of Darius (for its importance cf. App. VI. 4) consisted
in his introducing a regular tribute for the whole empire; perhaps
also he substituted government officials for native feudal princes
(so Stein, who compares i. 134. 3, and says the Median system
there described lasted to the time of Darius).</p>
<p>The main, though not the entire, source of Persian revenue, was
the land tax (vi. 42. 2). The sums given by H. are those due to
the royal treasury, not the whole amount raised in the provinces.</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">προστάσσων</lemma>. Rawlinson (and others) takes this as opposed
to <foreign lang="greek">ὑπερβαίνων</foreign>, &lsquo;generally he joined, but sometimes he passed over
the nearer tribes.&rsquo; He (ii. 563) argues that this was done because
the divisions were &lsquo;ethnical rather than geographical&rsquo;, an arrangement 
especially convenient among the nomadic tribes of the far East.
But grammar (there is no <foreign lang="greek">μέν, δέ</foreign>) and political sense alike render
this impossible; and as a fact H.'s list of tribes is geographically
arranged, except perhaps for the Utii (93. 2 n.) and the sixteenth
satrapy (93. 3 nn.). <foreign lang="greek">ὑπερβαίνων τοὺς π</foreign>. therefore must be taken parenthetically, 
and <foreign lang="greek">τὰ ἑκαστέρω . . . νέμων</foreign> repeats <foreign lang="greek">κατὰ ἔθνεα . . . προστάσσων</foreign>
in another form. Translate &lsquo;he fixed the tributes to come in to him,
nation by nation, while he joined their neighbours with each nation,
and, as he got further from the centre (<foreign lang="greek">ὑπερβαίνων τ. π</foreign>.), he distributed
the more remote nations in various groups&rsquo;. Thus each satrapy
consisted of the <foreign lang="greek">ἔθνος</foreign> whose name it bore (e.g. Ionia), and of the tribes
grouped with it (e. g. with Ionia went Magnesia, Aeolis, &amp;c., 90. 1).</p></div3>

which are here explained, a heavier (Babylonian) for silver coinage,
a lighter (Euboic) for gold; these were in the proportion of four to

the Euboic; there were 33,660 grammes in the Babylonian talent,

was Dascylitis (<bibl n="Thuc. 1.129.1">Thuc. i. 129. 1</bibl>).</p>

the strip of coast, but also (2) the Taurus region to the north as far
as, and even beyond, the Halys (i. 72. 2), and (3) the country to
the north-east (the later Commagene) as far as the Euphrates (v.
52. 3). Hence the tribute of this satrapy was a heavy one, 500
talents (v. 49. 6). As, however, 140 talents was spent in the
province, it is only reckoned as 360 talents in the total (c. 95).
Cilicia was held by native rulers who all bore the Semitic name
<foreign lang="greek">Συέννεσις</foreign> (cf. i. 74. 3; v. 118. 2; vii. 98. 1); perhaps this was a title

<p>The &lsquo;white horses&rsquo; were sacred to the sun-god Mithra (for their
sacrifice cf. <ref target="c.7.113.2" targOrder="U">vii. 113. 2 n.</ref>); hence one is paid for each of the 360
days in the year. They were also sacred to Ormazd (vii. 40).

little or no idea of the arrangement of the eastern half of the

read here, whom H. calls a Median tribe (i. 101. 1). They lived
(near the modern Ispahan) in the mountains separating Persia and
Susiana from Media, and forming the watershed of the Choaspes
(cf. Strabo 744 for their position and predatory character). The name
of the <foreign lang="greek">Ὀρθοκορυβάντιοι</foreign> (otherwise unknown) is explained by some as
&lsquo;dwellers in the mountain&rsquo;.</p></div3>

<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">Κάσπιοι κτλ</lemma>. These four tribes, none of which occur elsewhere,
for the Caspii here are not the same as those of 93. 3, must have
lived to the north-east of Media, on the southern shores of the
Caspian Sea. Perhaps they represent the satrapy of Hyrcania (cf.
c. 117 and vii. 62. 2), the omission of which is a perplexing feature
of this list. Hyrcania, however, does not occur in any of Darius'
lists (cf. App. VII. 1), though it is mentioned in the B. I. (ii. 16)
along with Parthia. It (Strabo 507 seq.) was more important in
Parthian than in Persian times (cf. Tac. Ann. xv. 1).</p>
<p>The <hi rend="bold">Bactrii</hi> or Bactriani lived in the basin of the upper Oxus:
their capital was the modern Balkh. The Aegli may be the <foreign lang="greek">Αὐγαλοί</foreign>
of Ptolemy, vi. 12, a Sagartian tribe south of the Jaxartes. The huge
16th satrapy (93. 3) included the wilder nomad tribes, and surrounded 
the more settled Bactria on three sides, north, west, and
south: their warriors (vii. 66. 1) were equipped like the Bactrians.</p></div3></div>

<p>H.'s 13th satrapy lies north-west of Media, while the 11th lies

<p>The 14th satrapy seems to have consisted of the whole of the

writes <foreign lang="greek">ἐκ Μύκων εἰς Ἀράξην ποταμόν</foreign>, apparently giving these as the
northern and southern limits of Asia. All the names except the
&lsquo;Thamanaeans&rsquo; occur in Darius' inscriptions; these are joined again

<p>The Sagartians (Persian nomads in i. 125) and the Utians (cf. B. I.
iii. 40, Yautiya, &lsquo;a district of Persia&rsquo;) seem to have been connected
with the ruling race, but may have been made tributaries for not
having assisted Cyrus in his attack on the Medes.</p>
<p>The Sagartians are described (viii. 85) as horsemen armed with
lassoes. The Sarangians are the <foreign lang="greek">Δράγγοι</foreign> of Arrian (Anab. iii. 21),
<pb n="285"/>
and lived in the modern Seistan. The name of <foreign lang="greek">Μύκοι</foreign> seems to
survive in the modern Mekran, the southern province of Persia.
Strabo (765) speaks of Macae on the coast of Arabia opposite.
Some have seen in the <foreign lang="greek">Οὔτιοι</foreign> the <foreign lang="greek">Οὔξιοι</foreign> of Arrian, Anab. iii. 17. 1,
who lived partly in the mountains south of Susa, and levied blackmail 
even on Persian kings; but they are geographically separated
from the rest of the 14th satrapy by Persia proper, and it is more
probable the Utii lived near the Persian Gulf.</p>
<p>The islands are those in the mouth of the Persian Gulf (cf. vii. 80),
off the now much-talked-of port of Bander Abbas.</p>

they would have the mountains between them and the Sacae.</p>
<p>For the position of the 16th satrapy cf. 92. 2 n. All the tribes in
it occur on the monuments of Darius. The Parthians, afterwards so
famous, lived in the modern Khorasan, south-east of the Caspian.
The Chorasmians lay north-east of them, on the lower Oxus (cf.
Arr. Anab. iv. 15). The capital of Sogdiana, the tribe further to the
north-east, was Samarcand; the name Soghd is still borne by the
district between the Oxus and the Jaxartes (Wilson, Aria. p. 129).
The Areii (in vii. 66 called <foreign lang="greek">Ἄριοι</foreign>&mdash;not the same as the <foreign lang="greek">Ἄριοι</foreign>, the old
name of the Medes, vii. 62. 1 n.) lived in West Afghanistan, where

<p>The 17th satrapy seems to correspond to Beloochistan. H. does
not use the later name Gedrosia, for which cf. Arr. Anab. vi. 22 seq.
On the coast of this country still lives a primitive race which is dark
brown (the Brahv&icirc;, but <foreign rend="ital">v. i.</foreign>); so too, on the south-east corner of
Arabia, Curzon speaks of the scanty survivors of a &lsquo;dark aboriginal
race living in the rocks by C. Mussandum&rsquo; (ii. 447). This race had
of course no connexion but that of colour with the Ethiopians of
Africa (for whom cf. <ref target="c.3.17" targOrder="U">iii. 17. 1 n.</ref> and vii. 70. 1). Lassen (I. A. i. 390)
thinks the dark race was perhaps once widely spread in Asia; he
quotes the Mah&acirc;bh&acirc;rata for &lsquo;black dwellers in the Himalaya&rsquo;. But
he denies that it survives in Beloochistan. The Paricanii are otherwise 
unknown, but may well be the inhabitants of the interior. Their
name is explained by some as = &lsquo;worshippers of demons&rsquo;, by others
(e. g. Holdich, p. 34) as the Sansk. &lsquo;Parvaka&rsquo; (= mountaineers). H.
couples them in vii. 68 with the Utians and Mycans, and the
Ethiopians with the Indians (vii. 70. 1).</p>
<p>The 18th satrapy seems to have consisted of the southern and
<pb n="286"/>
eastern parts of the mountainous region which, beginning with the
basin of the upper Aras, stretches west to the upper Euphrates and
south to the upper Tigris. For the Matieni cf. <ref target="c.1.72.2" targOrder="U">i. 72. 2 n.</ref></p>
<p>The <hi rend="bold">Saspeires</hi> lay north of Matiene; they occupy a &lsquo;small&rsquo; district
between Media and Colchis (i. 104; cf. iv. 37). Rawlinson, iv. 223,

<p>The <hi rend="bold">Alarodii</hi> are only mentioned here and in vii. 79, where they
are again joined with the Saspeires and armed like the Colchians.
Sir H. Rawlinson (ib. iv. 245 seq.) sees in their name a survival of
the &lsquo;Urarda&rsquo; (cf. Ararat) of the Inscriptions; this is generally
accepted (Maspero, iii. 55); they were a Semitic race who preceded
the Aryan Armenians in the mountain region north-west of the
Assyrian plain (round Lake Van), and who fought the Assyrians at
first for supremacy, then for independence. After H. they disappear,
being absorbed by the Armenians.</p></div3>

<p>The 19th satrapy lay north and north-west of the 18th, north and
north-east of the 13th (93. 1), and south of Colchis. All the tribes
in it, except the Moschi, lay on the coast of the Black Sea (cf. <bibl n="Xen. Anab. 4.8">Xen.
Anab. iv. 8 </bibl>for the Macrones&mdash;whose name survives in the Makur
Dagh&mdash;and v. 5. 2 for the Tibareni); their armament resembles
that of the Colchians. The Mares only occur here (and in vii. 79)

<p>The <hi rend="bold">Tibareni</hi> and <hi rend="bold">Moschi</hi> (Assyr. &lsquo;Tabali and Muskana&rsquo;) are
the Tubal and Meshech of Ezek. xxvii. 13 (cf. 32. 26), where they
are among the &lsquo;merchants of Tyre&rsquo;, trading in slaves and brass;
they had long resisted the Assyrians, and seem to have been finally
driven into the mountains by the Cimmerian invasion (cf. <ref target="c.1.15" targOrder="U">i. 15 n.</ref>).

<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">Ἰνδῶν</lemma>. Two questions arise: <hi rend="bold">I. What knowledge had H. of
the Indians? II. How far were they under Persian rule?</hi></p>
<p>I. The following points may be accepted. H. thinks that (<foreign rend="ital">a</foreign>) the
Indians are the most remote nation known on the east; beyond
them is desert (98. 2; iv. 40. 2). This idea is based partly on some
rumour as to the great deserts east of the Indus, partly on ignorance.
As H. knows nothing of mountains in these parts, it is difficult to
think (as Rawlinson) that he refers to the great deserts north of the
Himalaya.</p>
<p>(<foreign rend="ital">b</foreign>) The subject Indians are the inhabitants of the lower Indus
valley and the modern Sind and part of the Punjab east of the Indus.
The wealth of the satrapy compels us to believe that much of the
country which is now desert, e. g in Sind, was then irrigated and
fertile; but even in Strabo's (p. 697) time part of the south Indus
valley was <foreign lang="greek">θηρίοις μᾶλλον ἢ ἀνθρώποις σύμμετρος</foreign>.</p>
<p>(<foreign rend="ital">c</foreign>) Beyond this region H. knows (1) vaguely of a great population; 
the Indians are the most numerous race in the world (<foreign rend="ital">v. i.</foreign>).
(2) Most of them are utter barbarians (c. 98 seq.). So far as his
stories are true, they can only refer to the primitive Dravidian
<pb n="287"/>
races, who were left behind in the hilly country on the frontier by
the tide of Aryan conquest. (3) But he has accurate information
of the Indian canoes and cotton dresses (98. 3, 4) and of their
respect for animal life (100. 1).</p>
<p>(<foreign rend="ital">d</foreign>) H. as usual is free from the ridiculous tales which later writers
give, e. g. Ctesias (cf. 98. 3; 102 nn.).</p>
<p>II. (<foreign rend="ital">a</foreign>) H. (iv. 44. 3) tells us that Darius, after the voyage of
Scylax, subdued some Indians and used the Indus as a waterway.
This agrees with Darius' inscription at Persepolis, where he puts
India among his conquests. H. (102. 1 n.) seems to limit the
tributary Indians to the region in north-west India. It is noticeable
that Strabo (687) is ignorant of these Persian conquests.</p>
<p>(<foreign rend="ital">b</foreign>) It is probable that Darius received regular gifts from the
trans-Indus tribes, though by the time of Alexander, the Persians
had lost all authority beyond that river.</p>
<p>H.'s statements here and in v. 3. 1 as to the number of the Indians
are implicitly contradicted by Thucydides (ii. 97. 5-6), who says
that with the Scyths no nation in Europe or Asia could be compared. 
Thucydides' narrow Hellenism involves him in a double
error: (<foreign rend="ital">a</foreign>) He does not know that the Scyths proper were a comparatively 
small race (App. XI. 6). (<foreign rend="ital">b</foreign>) He ignores the great populations 
of the East, of which H. has dimly heard.</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ἑξήκοντα καὶ τριηκόσια</lemma>. The 360 talents, being paid in gold, have

<p>The reading (cf. 89. 2 n.) <foreign lang="greek">ὀγδώκοντα καὶ ὀκτακόσια</foreign> (for the <foreign lang="greek">τεσσαράκοντα

certain. For (<foreign rend="ital">a</foreign>) the sum total of all the tributes (less the 140 talents
spent in Cilicia, 90. 3) is 7,600 Babylonian talents. This&mdash;taking
the ratio of 60:78 (89. 2)&mdash;gives 9,880 Euboic talents. (<foreign rend="ital">b</foreign>) If the
value of the Indian gold be added, i. e. 360 x 13 = 4,680, we have
the total 14,560 talents.</p>
<p>This reading then both preserves the proper relation of gold and
silver, and makes the addition of H. correct, while the other text
does neither. For the ratio of the precious metals (really 13.3, not 13)
cf. B&ouml;ckh, i. 38 seq.; it varied, but was often reckoned as 10 : 1 (Lys.
xix. 42-3, property of Conon; Xen. An. i. 7. 18, 3,000 darics = 10 tals.
= 60,000 drs.; Liv. xxxviii. 11). The modern proportion is about
15 1/2 : 1. As the Persian gold was the purest (cf. iv 166. 2), H.
rightly gives a higher ratio than the usual.</p></div3>

survives in &lsquo;Pushtoo&rsquo;, the Afghans' name for themselves. In vii.

lived on the southern slopes of the Hindo-Koosh in Kafiristan.</p>
<p>For the story of the ants cf. Bunbury, i. 229 f., or (more fully)
Lassen, i. 850. We may note as to it (1) Nearchus, Alexander's
admiral, had seen the skins of the &lsquo;gold-digging ants&rsquo; which are
&lsquo;like those of panthers&rsquo; (Strabo 705); Strabo quotes the story, with
additional details (e. g. that meat is put out to distract the attention
of the ants), from Megasthenes, who went as ambassador to Sandracottus 
at Patna circ. 300 B.C., and &lsquo;from others&rsquo; (706); Megasthenes
places it in a plain &lsquo;3,000 stadia round, <foreign lang="greek">τῶν προσεῴων καὶ ὀρεινῶν
Ἰνδῶν</foreign>&rsquo;. (2) It was often repeated in the Middle Ages, e. g. in a
twelfth-century letter of Prester John (quoted by B&auml;hr, <foreign rend="ital">ad loc.</foreign>),
who gives the ants seven feet and four wings. Busbecq. (Ep. Turc. 4)
says that in 1559 a Persian ambassador brought, among other gifts,
to the Sultan Soliman at Constantinople, an Indian ant &lsquo;magnitudine 
canis mediocris, animal mordax et saevum&rsquo;. (3) That ants
dug up gold is a genuine Indian story; cf. Wilson, Ariana, pp. 135-6
(quoting the Mah&acirc;bh&acirc;rata), who says the gold paid as tribute was
called &lsquo;ant gold&rsquo; (Pipp&iacute;lika).</p>
<p>There are three facts underlying the story: (<foreign rend="ital">a</foreign>) that ant-heaps
contained gold dust; (<foreign rend="ital">b</foreign>) that certain animals and their skins were
exported; these may have been marmots, some of which are spotted
like panthers; they are certainly burrowing animals; (<foreign rend="ital">c</foreign>) gold is
abundant in the mountain chains north-west of India. It is to be

<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">Ἠριδανόν</lemma>. Three stages may be noted in the use of this name:
(1) It seems to have been a general name for rivers. Cf. the
Rhodanus (and perhaps the Rhenus) and the Radaune near
Dantzig. It may contain the root of the Greek <foreign lang="greek">ῥέω</foreign>, while the &lsquo;dan&rsquo;
can be compared with Danube, Don, Dniester, &amp;c. This is not
inconsistent with H.'s remark that the name is Greek; in the form
<foreign lang="greek">Ἠριδανός</foreign> it fits into hexameter verse, and may be connected with
<foreign lang="greek">ἦρι</foreign> &lsquo;early&rsquo;, so that &lsquo;it would be originally an epithet of the sun&rsquo;

<pb n="293"/>
<foreign rend="ital">v. i.</foreign> for his place in the myth). (2) Hesiod (Theog. 338) is the first
Greek to use it, coupling it with the Nile and the Alpheus, but
without locating it. Aeschylus (<bibl n="Plin. Nat. 37.32">Plin. N. H. xxxvii. 32</bibl>) made it =
the Rhone, which he puts in Spain. (3) H.'s contemporary
Pherecydes first made it the Po. This identification was probably
due to two causes, (<foreign rend="ital">a</foreign>) myth had connected the origin of amber
from the tears of Phaethon's sisters with the Eridanus, (<foreign rend="ital">b</foreign>) the
amber route struck the Mediterranean at the head of the Adriatic,
i.e. not far from the Po (cf. for amber route iv. 34 nn.).</p>

applied to imaginary islands; cf. Rice Holmes, Anc. Britain, pp. 483-8,
for a full account of the ancient evidence and of modern views as to
it; a shorter one is in Tozer, <foreign rend="ital">u. s.</foreign> pp. 37-8. H. declines to commit
himself to any of the stories, which were the result of the ignorancc
as to the islands. This ignorance was due to Phoenician exclusiveness; 
Strabo (176) tells how one of their merchants ran his ship on
a shoal, to destroy his Roman pursuers. Cf. Diod. v. 22 (quoting
Timaeus) for tin-mining in Britain and the tin route across Gaul;
the metal was brought from Ictis (St. Michael's Mount) to Corbilo
on the Loire (for this cf. Strabo 190), and thence <foreign lang="greek">ἐπὶ τῶν ἵππων</foreign>, thirty
days' journey to the mouth of the Rhone. The trade may be as old

known of the position of the tribes mentioned (cf. cc. 92-3 nn.).
The idea, however, of the chapter is quite correct; the control of
irrigation is in the East one of the prerogatives of government, and
great sums are charged for the use of water. Cf. R&eacute;clus, ix. 180,
for this in modern Persia. H.'s informants have made a fancy
picture out of real facts. It is probable, too, as Meyer suggests
(<foreign rend="ital">v. i.</foreign>), that the canalization of the land was intended as a check on
the raids of the nomads of the north-east. (Cf. the similar defensive

who says, probably by implication correcting H., Minos <foreign lang="greek">παλαίτατος
ὧν ἀκοῇ ἴσμεν . . . τῆς νῦν Ἑλληνικῆς θαλάσσης ἐπὶ πλεῖστον ἐκράτησε</foreign>.
Whatever is true in the traditions as to Minos, H. is right in implying 
that they are not strictly historical.</p>
<p>But modern research has here, as elsewhere, largely vindicated
the Greek view that the myths contained a large element of history
(cf. Burrows, Discoveries in Crete, especially pp. 11-14, for the
Minoan empire); Burrows ingeniously suggests that the eight
&lsquo;Minoas&rsquo; (cf. Fick, Vorg. Ortsn. p. 27) scattered from Syria to Sicily,
may perhaps reveal the greatness of their founder (cf. the &lsquo;Alex<pb n="296"/>
andrias&rsquo; and &lsquo;Antiochs&rsquo; of the fourth and third centuries. The
argument that founders' names are not given to colonies till quite
late proves nothing against this; for the Greek colonies from the
eighth century onwards were founded by republics, not by kings.</p></div3></div>

<p><hi rend="ital">The Revolt of Babylon and its capture by Darius.</hi></p>
<p>I. The general outline of the events is told by Darius in the B. I.
(cf. Maspero, iii. 675 seq. for a brilliant sketch). Susiana and
Babylon (B. I. i. 16) revolted within a fortnight of the death of
Smerdis; the leader of the latter pretended to be the son of
Nabonidus, and took the name Nebuchadnezzar. While Darius
was besieging Babylon, nine other provinces revolted (ii. 2), including
Persia, Media, and Parthia. After Darius had captured Babylon
(ii. 1), how he does not say, though he mentions two great victories
<pb n="300"/>
over the Babylonians, he proceeded against the other rebels.
While he was reducing them, another pretender rose and seized
Babylon (iii. 13), but was reduced, apparently without difficulty, by
Intaphrenes (iii. 14). There are thus two revolts and two captures
of Babylon.</p>
<p>II. There is, however, some uncertainty whether the story of H.
refers to either. Ctesias (22, p. 69) says that the stratagem of
Zopyrus belongs to his son Megabyzus, and to the capture of
Babylon by Xerxes (478 B. C.). The view that this is the siege
referred to is very generally adopted, e. g. by Sayce, <foreign rend="ital">ad loc.</foreign>, N&ouml;ldeke,
E. B.<hi rend="sup">9</hi> 18. 572 (doubtfully), Lehmann, W. f&uuml;r K. P. 1900, p. 963.</p>
<p>The reasons are: (<foreign rend="ital">a</foreign>) It is impossible to fit a siege of twenty
months (153. 1) into the record of the B. I. (But the chronology
of that record is most uncertain, and in ii. 2 it seems to imply a long
resistance.) (<foreign rend="ital">b</foreign>) Lehmann (<foreign rend="ital">u. s.</foreign>) tries to fit in H.'s &lsquo;nineteen months&rsquo;
(c. 152) with dates given by the Babylonian tablets for Xerxes (but
there are at least two uncertain quantities in his equation). (<foreign rend="ital">c</foreign>) The
cruelty of the victor (159. 2) is more like the character of Xerxes.
Duncker, however, and Maspero accept the narrative of H., and
the latter (iii. 677 n.) supports his view also from the Babylonian
tablets. It seems safer to follow H., for (<foreign rend="ital">a</foreign>) he had good evidence;
Zopyrus, the grandson of the chief actor in the events, deserted to
Athens about 440 B. C. (160. 2 n.); (<foreign rend="ital">b</foreign>) the elder Zopyrus was certainly
made satrap of Babylon.</p>
<p>III. (1) In the details of H. there is certainly exaggeration and
Greek colouring (<foreign rend="ital">v. i.</foreign>). His chronology too is impossible (150. 1 n.).</p>
<p>(2) The story of the self-devotion of Zopyrus is generally rejected;
Sayce (<foreign rend="ital">ad loc.</foreign>, who accepts the mutilation itself as a fact) and Sir H.
Rawlinson (<foreign rend="ital">ad</foreign> c. 155) argue that no mutilated person could have
held rule; but (<foreign rend="ital">a</foreign>) the scars of Zopyrus would have been offensive
to no one but the Babylonians; (<foreign rend="ital">b</foreign>) the position of Darius needed
desperate measures, and some explanation must be found for his
capture of an impregnable city; (<foreign rend="ital">c</foreign>) the silence of Darius in the
B. I. proves nothing; it certainly would have been inconsistent with
the whole tone of the inscription to describe how desperate his
position had been; (<foreign rend="ital">d</foreign>) Polyaenus (vii. 11. 8) confirms H., and says
the stratagem was borrowed from a Sacian chief, Risaces (for the
war to which this story belongs cf. App. V. 9); he, after proving
his loyalty by self-mutilation, led Darius into the desert. This
story, which is told in great detail, whether it be true or not, shows
that Polyaenus is not simply reproducing the narrative of H.; (<foreign rend="ital">e</foreign>)
the fact that the story is told by Persian poets of native heroes
(Sir H. Rawlinson), and by Livy (i. 53) of Sextus Tarquinius,
proves nothing against its having really happened once long before.</p>
<p>It seems safer, therefore, to accept the story as having, at any
rate, a basis of fact.</p></div>

<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">Βαβυλώνιοι</lemma>. H. implies that the revolt followed at once on the

interval; for the healing of Darius followed &lsquo;not long after&rsquo; the overthrow 
of Oroetes (129. 1); then comes the expedition of Democedes
(133. 1), and &lsquo;after this&rsquo; that against Samos (139. 1), &lsquo;contemporary

Cimmerian raid in the seventh century is mentioned later (l. 952).
According to the chronologers, Trapezus, the daughter state of
Sinope, was founded 756 B.C.; but Busolt (i. 465-6) thinks the Milesian 
colonization of the Black Sea belongs to the seventh century,
although they had factories there already in the eighth. He argues
with reason that the Greek towns on the Black Sea must be later
than the foundation of Byzantium (657 B.C.). The &lsquo;second&rsquo; colonization

the main body of the nation reached Asia Minor half a century later.</p></div3></div>

Pauly (<foreign rend="ital">s. v.</foreign>), because his poem explained the Cimmerian invasion;
but this fact is consistent with the early date. There is no
need to deny his historic reality (as Crusius in Rosch. i. 2814), but
his story has obviously been affected by cult stories of Apollo. For
him cf. Pindar, fr. 271. His poem had perished by the time of
Dionysius of Halicarnassus (Thuc. 23; vi. 864), but Tzetzes (Chil. vii.
690-1) quotes some lines supposed to be from it (as to the Arimaspi):
<quote lang="greek"><p>a)fneiou\s i(/ppoisi, polu/rrhnas, polubou/tas,
o)fqalmo\n d' e(/n' e(/kastos e)/xei xari/enti metw/pw|.</p></quote>
<pb n="307"/></p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ποιέων</lemma>. H. emphasizes the poetic character of Aristeas. Cf.
<foreign lang="greek">φοιβόλαμπτος</foreign>.</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">γρῦπας</lemma>. The &lsquo;griffins&rsquo; are combined with the Arimaspi also by
Aeschylus (<bibl n="Aesch. PB 802-4">P. V. 802-4</bibl>), who calls them <foreign lang="greek">ὀξύστομοι Ζηνὸς ἀκραγεῖς
κύνες</foreign>. Two types of them may be distinguished; the more common
has the head and wings of an eagle, the body of a lion; this type
may be Hittite, but is found in Egypt as early as the eighteenth
dynasty, and in prehistoric Greece (Perrot et Chipiez, vi. 831);
the other type, the winged lion, is Chaldaean. This symbol was
combined in Greek art, from the fifth century onwards, with the
story here told by H. from Aristeas; in this story we have probably
a double of that of the &lsquo;ants&rsquo; (iii. 102), i. e. it is a traveller's tale
as to the dangers of gold-getting in Central Asia.</p>
<p>The wide diffusion of this combination in later Greek art is good
evidence of the popularity of H.'s work. Ctesias (Ind. 12, p. 250)
transports the griffins to the north of India, and substitutes them
for the &lsquo;ants&rsquo; of H. (<foreign rend="ital">u. s.</foreign>); it is characteristic of him that he
describes them in detail, with &lsquo;white wings, red breast&rsquo;, &amp;c. For
the whole subject of &lsquo;griffins&rsquo; cf. Furtw&auml;ngler in Rosch. Lex.
i. 1742 seq.</p>
<p>The gold of Central Asia is of course a fact, and the Arimaspi
may well be a nomad tribe of Central Asia, who affirmed that their
gold was derived from great deserts, e. g. that of Gobi; they may be
the ancestors of the Turks and the Huns. They were credited with
one eye as a mark of their wildness, on the analogy of the Cyclops;
Strabo (21) puts the matter the other way and makes Homer
&lsquo;borrow&rsquo; the Cyclops from Scythia. Others see in them a purely
fictitious people, a wild counterpart of the mild Hyperboreans. The
name is explained by some &lsquo;dwellers in the deserts&rsquo; (Rosch. <foreign rend="ital">s. v.</foreign>),
but M&uuml;llenhof (iii. 106) makes it &lsquo;having docile horses&rsquo;. Pauly,
ii. 827, translates it &lsquo;owners of wild horses&rsquo;. H.'s etymology is no
doubt that of the people of Olbia.</p>
<p>It is to the credit of H. that he does not believe in the &lsquo;one-eyed&rsquo;
(iii. 116. 2), and that he avoids such foolish rationalization as that
of Eustathius, who said (G. G. M. ii. 223) the Arimaspi had one eye
smaller than the other, because, being archers, they were continually
closing one eye to shoot.</p>
<p>The whole legend is familiar in Milton's
<cit><quote><l>As when a gryphon through the wilderness</l>

last point is confirmed by the coins (Head, H. N. 272). It was
founded by the Milesians (78. 3) in 647 B. C., and was the oldest
colony beyond the Danube. H. (101. 2) says the Borysthenes was

<div type="chapter" n="21-5">
<p><hi rend="ital">The tribes north-east of Scythia.</hi> As to the general geography
it may be noted: (1) H. claims, and with reason, to speak from
knowledge as far as &lsquo;the Bald men&rsquo; (24. 1). This was no doubt
derived from the merchants using the north-east trade route, which
ran across the steppes into Central Asia. This was superseded
under the Roman empire by that <foreign rend="ital">via</foreign> Trebizond (Beazley, Dawn of
G. i. 179), but used in the Middle Ages, e. g. by Carpini <foreign rend="ital">c.</foreign> 1250
(<foreign rend="ital">ib.</foreign> ii. 296 f.). (2) H. knows the route is north by east (cf. 22.
1, 3 <foreign lang="greek">ἀποκλίνοντι πρὸς τὴν ἠῶ</foreign>), but wrongly thinks it mainly north.
(3) H. here knows nothing of the Volga (cf. 124. 1 n.), and his
<pb n="310"/>
mountains (25. 1) seem to be a confusion of the Ural and the Altai;
their distance would correspond to the Ural, but they run east and
west (25. 1 n.) as the Altai Mountains do; perhaps H., though disbelieving 
in the fabulous Rhipaean Mountains, has allowed himself
to be misled by their supposed position, east and west. It may be
taken as certain that his informants knew nothing of the mountains
except as something to be avoided. (4) His description of the
&lsquo;black earth belt&rsquo; (23. 1) is accurate (for it cf. E. B.<hi rend="sup">11</hi> xxiii. 881).</p>
<p>Westberg (Klio, iv. 183 seq.) identifies his tribes thus:</p>
<p>(1) The Sauromatae extend from the Manitch, a tributary on the
left bank of the Don, to Kamischin on Volga in south of the Saratov
province. (2) The Budini are in the Saratov province as far north
as Syzran; an Arab geographer of the tenth century describes this
country as well wooded (cf. c. 21 <foreign lang="greek">δασέαν</foreign>). (3) The desert north of
Budini (22. 1) in the region of the Singelei hills on right bank of
Volga, near Simbirsk. (4) The route then turns east (23. 1), up
the valley of the Kama; the Thyssagetae (c. 22) live on the
R. Bielaya nearly to the <emph>southern</emph> Ural. (5) The Argippaei live in
the &lsquo;foot hills&rsquo; (23. 2) south of the Ural, while beyond the Ural on
the south-east (25. 2) are the Issedones, north-east of Caspian; cf.
i. 201, the Massagetae live &lsquo;opposite the Issedones&rsquo;, with the Araxes
(i. e. Sir Daria or Jaxartes) between them. H. then is consistent at
once with himself and with fact.</p>
<p>As Ptolemy, however, puts the Issedones in Central Asia, Tomaschek 
violently transfers all the tribes far to the east, puts the Argippaei 
under the Altai, and conjectures that the Hyperboreans are the
Chinese (Meyer, iii. 65, accepts generally Tomaschek's views).</p></div>

P. Maeotis which divides Scyths and Sauromatae (cf. 117 nn.).
From this it is usually concluded (cf. Stein, Macan, in their maps)
that H. made the P. Maeotis run due north and south; but this
inference is quite needless, and it makes H.'s account of Darius'
campaign hopelessly inconsistent (cf. 101. 3 n.) with itself. For the

Indian Padaei (iii. 99. 1) death is anticipated. Possibly the variations 
of the accounts are due to the fancy of H. (e. g. the grim
humour of iii. 99. 1); but we may trace in the custom three
different ideas. (1) The desire to partake of the merits of the
dead by eating him (cf. Frazer, G. B. ii<hi rend="sup">1</hi>. 89), which is prominent in
this passage; (2) the desire to give an honourable end (i. 216. 3;
iii. 38); (3) the attempt to crush the spirit of decay before it
becomes powerful (iii. 99). Of these (1) and (3) are inconsistent,
but genuine pieces of savage thought, (2) is perhaps only a Greek
explanation of a barbarous custom.</p>
<p>For the eating of dead relatives cf. in ancient times Onesicritus

with contempt), as to the tribes of the Caucasus; in mediaeval
times, M. Polo (iii. 10; vol. ii, 293, 298) as to Sumatra. In
modern times instances are quoted from the neighbourhood of
New Guinea (Wallace) and from India. This last is the cannibalism 
of the Birhors in Chota Nagpore, as late as 1863 (J. A. S. B.
xxxiv, pt. ii, p. 18); but Dalton, who originally recorded it, says
<pb n="312"/>
in his Ethnology of Bengal, p. 220 (1872), &lsquo;I have no faith in the
story,&rsquo; i. e. he thinks either he or the natives had misunderstood
each other. This self-correction in a trained observer may make
us sympathize with mistakes in H., who was not a trained observer.
For cannibalism generally cf. Sollas (Anc. Hunt, p. 145); he says

wooded (cf. &lsquo;The Woodland&rsquo;, 18. 1 n.); but even now the wettest
months are in the summer, and their maximum rainfall is three

<p><hi rend="ital">The Hyperboreans.</hi></p>
<p>The Hyperboreans were so established in Greek traditional
geography that H. feels bound to discuss them; but he argues that
the legend as to them is not native but Greek.</p>
<p>The earliest mention of them is in the Homeric Hymn to
Dionysus (vii. 28-9), dated by Sikes and Allen in the seventh or
sixth century B. C.,
<quote lang="greek"><l>e)/lpomai h)\ *ai)/gupton a)fi/cetai h)\ o(/ ge *ku/pron</l>
<l>h)\ e)s *(uperbore/ous h)\ e(kaste/rw,</l></quote></p>
<p>where their name is equivalent to &lsquo;the ends of the earth&rsquo;. We
may assume that H. found it used in this sense in &lsquo;Hesiod&rsquo; and
in the &lsquo;Epigoni&rsquo;, though these works have both perished. If so,
the popular etymology of their name, &lsquo;those beyond the north
wind,&rsquo; goes back at least to the seventh century. It is difficult
therefore to see in them early <emph>Greek</emph> worshippers of Apollo in
Thessaly and other northern parts of Greece (as Farnell, C. G. S.
iv. 100 seq.); the first evidence for this view is a fragment of
Hecataeus, who seems to identify them with the Locrians (Schol.
to Apoll. Rhod. ii. 675). It is supported by the explanation of the
name as = <foreign lang="greek">ὑπέρφοροι</foreign> (cf. <foreign lang="greek">Περφερέες</foreign>, 33. 3), i. e. the sacred &lsquo;carriers&rsquo;
of offerings (cf. c. 33 n.). But it is better to suppose the Hyperboreans
<pb n="314"/>
an imaginary people, the northern counterpart of the blameless
Ethiopians of the south (iii. 17. 1 n.). As geographical knowledge
increased, their home was shifted further and further away (for
references <foreign rend="ital">vid.</foreign> Farnell, <foreign rend="ital">u. s.</foreign>). Pindar (Ol. iii. 16) puts them on the
Danube; then they were associated (by Damastes, a younger
contemporary of H., fr. 1, F. H. G. ii. 65) with the imaginary
Rhipaean Mountains, from which the north wind blew; Hippocrates
(de Aer. 19) and even Aristotle (Meteor. i. 13, 350 b) accept these
mountains as a reality. Later we find the Hyperboreans in an island,
&lsquo;opposite the Celts,&rsquo; which seems to be Britain (Hec. Abd. fr.
2, F. H. G. ii. 386); and finally, in the eleventh century A. D., they
were identified with the Scandinavians.</p>
<p>The Hyperboreans were credited with all the virtues, including
vegetarianism (just as, even as late as the eighteenth century A. D.,
Linnaeus thought the Lapps were free from all the vices of civilization 
and that they lived to be over 100 years old); they were
especially connected with the worship of Apollo (c. 33 nn., <bibl n="Pind. P. 10">Pind.
Pyth. x. 30</bibl>, and Bacchyl. iii. 59), and so identified with the Delphians
by Mnaseas, a pupil of Eratosthenes (fr. 24, F. H. G. iii. 153).</p>
<p>H.'s refutation of the Hyperborean myth may be an attack on
Hecataeus; Diodorus (ii. 47) found it in the works bearing his name,
especially the story of Abaris (c. 36 n.). It is needless, as is usually
done, to refer this passage in Diodorus to Hecataeus of Abdera.</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">δοκέω</lemma>: the argument is, Aristeas might have got his story of
the Hyperboreans from the Issedones (13. 1); but this is improbable, 
as the Scyths know nothing of the Hyperboreans,
though they repeat the rest of the Issedones' story (c. 27).</p>
<p>The &lsquo;Epigoni&rsquo; was the sequel of the Thebais; Pausanias (ix.
9. 2) ranked it, after the Iliad and the Odyssey, as the best of the
Cyclic poems.</p></div>

<div3 id="c.4.33.1" type="section" n="1">
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">Δήλιοι</lemma>. The following points may be noticed in the Delian story:
(1) H.'s source is obviously the hymn (35. 1) as well as the temple
tradition; he is familiar with the shrine (34. 2, 35. 4), and compares
the ritual with what he has seen in Thrace (33. 5). (2) The offerings
were wrapped in straw not only as packing material, but to shield
their sanctity. No doubt such offerings came to Delos regularly
from the states of which it was the religious centre (for Delos
cf. <ref target="c.6.97.1" targOrder="U">vi. 97. 1 n.</ref> and Jebb, Essays). (3) With these ritual connexions 
has been combined the tradition of one of the oldest traderoutes 
of Europe, the &lsquo;Amber route&rsquo;, from the northern end of the
Adriatic, near which the Alps are lowest, down the coast, and then
from Dodona across to the Malian Gulf. The Greek stages are
given carefully, but the northern ones are unknown, and in their
place (regardless of geography) are inserted the Hyperboreans,
who were far to the north-east, but who were especially connected
with Apollo. This route is dated by A. J. Evans (Freeman,
Sicily, iv. 220-1) as early as 1,000 B. C.; for a brief account of it cf.
<pb n="315"/>
Tozer, Geog. pp. 31 seq.; he points out that amber also reached the
Mediterranean through Gaul by the Rhone valley, at least as early
as the time of Pytheas (fourth century), and possibly even before
the foundation of Massilia. (4) The common tendency to duplicate
beginnings (cf. the Spartan kings, who are not Eurysthenidae and
Proclidae, but Agiadae and Eurypontidae) is clearly seen; probably 
both pairs of maidens are personified attributes of divinity (<foreign rend="ital">v.i.</foreign>).
(5) The tradition is also given in Callimachus (Hymn. Del. 283),
who follows H., and in Pausanias (i. 31. 2), who, however, following
an Attic tradition (probably dating from the time of Athenian control 
of Delos), brings the offerings by an eastern route <foreign rend="ital">via</foreign> the
Arimaspi, the Issedones, and Sinope to Prasiae in Attica, &lsquo;where
there is a shrine of Apollo&rsquo;; cf. also Plut. Mor. 1136.</p>

to Delos lay on both sides of the Euripus, for, beside the Euboic
route implied by H., there was a shrine of Apollo at Delium, and
his oldest shrine in Attica was in the Marathonian Tetrapolis,

quite out of place in a general sketch. (2) He then gives the

(strongly adverse), and H. Berger, pp. 62-5, who formerly rejected
the story, but now &lsquo;reserves a final judgement till circumstances
are more favourable&rsquo;. The arguments for its truth are: (1)
The time is adequate. (2) The currents would be favourable all
the way, while on the east coast the voyage would be assisted by
the north monsoon, and in the west by the south trade-wind. (3)
The circumstance disbelieved by H. is a strong confirmation; the
sun (not &lsquo;the sunrise&rsquo;) in the southern hemisphere would actually be
&lsquo;on the right&rsquo;, so long as they sailed west, and from the Equator to
the Cape of Good Hope the course would be south-west and then
west, while on the return journey it would be slightly northwest. 
(4) The voyage was undertaken for a practical purpose, to
facilitate communication between Mediterranean and Red Seas; as
its result was useless for this purpose it was forgotten, just as the
discovery of America by the Northmen in the eleventh century was
forgotten till the nineteenth. On the other hand: (1) Later
geographers rejected the story, e.g. Posidonius (Strabo, 98), Strabo
(<foreign rend="ital">ib.</foreign>), Polybius (iii. 37); the last-named doubted if the sea were
continuous round Africa, and Aristotle (Meteor. ii. 1, 354 a) also
denied its continuity. (2) It is strange that H. tells no stories of the
marvels of the South, of the change of seasons, &amp;c. [But this
argument is of little value.] (3) The change in the position of the
sun was an easy guess for any one who had seen the vertical sun at
Syene. (4) Exaggeration was easy; so the voyage of Hanno, who
perhaps reached as far as Sierra Leone (Bunbury, i. 318 seq.), is
represented by Pliny (ii. 67. 169) as having been extended to
Arabia. (But Pliny's inaccurate and contradictory statements are
no parallel to H.'s plain and straightforward narrative.) On the
whole it seems best to accept the story, as Meyer (iii. 60) unhesitatingly

it says nothing of the Indian Ocean (Bunbury, i. 384

<p><hi rend="bold">Pactyice</hi> (with <hi rend="bold">Caspatyrus</hi>) is mentioned in iii. 102. 1 as bordering
the north of India. Stein identifies it with North-east Afghanistan;
the Afghans still call themselves &lsquo;Pakhtun&rsquo; or &lsquo;Pashtun&rsquo; (cf.
&lsquo;Pathans&rsquo;); he makes Caspatyrus = Kabul, preferring the form
<foreign lang="greek">Κασπάπυρος</foreign> (Hec. fr. 179; F. H. G. i. 12); H., he thinks, confuses 
the Kabul tributary with the Indus main stream, and so makes
(wrongly) the Indus &lsquo;flow east&rsquo;; this view is shared by Brunnhofer,
Urg. Ari. i. 54. But the Kabul river is unnavigable. Wilson makes
<foreign lang="greek">Κασπάτυρος</foreign> = city of Casyapa, i. e. Kashmir, which once included
much of the Punjaub (Ariana, p. 137); but this seems impossible.</p>
<p>Scylax probably started down the Indus from just above Attock,
<pb n="320"/>
which lies at the junction of the Indus and the Kabul, about 200
miles almost due east of the town of Kabul; H.'s informant confused 
the main city of the district with the exact starting-point on
the Indus. There is no need to doubt this voyage; H. writes of it
from contemporary evidence, and his statement is confirmed by the
fragments of Darius' inscriptions on his Nile canal (ii. 158. 1 n.). It
is to be noted that he tells of no impossibilities, like the later fiction
of Patrocles' voyage round into the Caspian (Pliny, <bibl n="Plin. Nat. 6.21">N. H. vi. 58</bibl>).
Berger, however (pp.73-5), is very doubtful of the reality of Scylax'
voyage because of (1) H.'s mistake as to the course of the Indus
(<foreign rend="ital">v. i.</foreign>). (2) His ignorance of the Persian Gulf; a coasting voyage
up this would have brought Scylax nearly to Susa, whence a new
voyage was necessary to bring him to the Red Sea. H. makes it
only <emph>one</emph> voyage. [But probably Scylax never went into the Persian
Gulf at all; his coasting voyage would bring him to a Persian port
at the Isle of Ormuz, thence he would sail across the Straits of
Ormuz and resume his voyage to the south and west. This course
is so obvious that it was not definitely recorded.] (3) Arrian (Ind.
19 seq., Anab. vii. 20) knows nothing of the voyage of Scylax [but
Posidonius (Strabo 100) believed in it], and tells us Alexander's
seamen failed to get round into the Red Sea. Myres (G. J., 1896,
623) conjectures the &lsquo;Indian river&rsquo; to be the Ganges, and that
&lsquo;an expedition . . . doubled C. Comorin, a voyage for which
thirty months is not too long, though it is too long for a journey
home from the mouth of the Indus&rsquo;.</p></div3>

completely the real meanings of &lsquo;Asia&rsquo; and &lsquo;Europe&rsquo; were forgotten
in H.'s time. &lsquo;Asia&rsquo; is first used in Pindar (Ol. vii. 34), but the

occurs first in Hymn to Apollo, 250-1 (cf. 290-1), where it is used
of the Greek mainland, as opposed to Peloponnese and the &lsquo;seagirt
islands&rsquo;. The names seem to be derived from the Assyrian, &lsquo;a&ccedil;u&rsquo;

<p>H. seems about to begin the story of Darius' campaign, but the
mention of the nomadic habits of the Scyths leads to a further
digression on the great rivers, in which feature, so favourable to
commerce, H., like a true Greek, is especially interested (cf. c. 82
for his emphasis on their importance), all the more so because
Greece had no such rivers. It may be noted generally that (1) H.
is fairly accurate as to the lower courses of the rivers as far as the
Dnieper, but that beyond the Dnieper his account is unrecognizable
and full of difficulties. (2) That with regard to their sources, he
ignores the fabled Rhipaean Mountains, which even Aristotle
(Meteor. i. 13, 350 b) made the source of the Russian rivers (cf.
32 nn.); but his lakes, from which he derives six of his rivers, are
equally theoretical (57. 2 n.). The revers really rise in great swamps;
but probably in H.'s days these may have been more like shallow
lakes. Cf. Krapotkin, Geog. Journ. xxiii. 725. R&eacute;clus (v. 284-5)
describes the shrinking of the water-area: except the rivers of
Finland, all the great watercourses of Russia have &lsquo;vid&eacute; les anciens

<p>These chapters deserve careful study, as evidence of H.'s accuracy

the belief that the future life is a continuation of the present,
in which the dead needs all he needed here (cf. Tylor, P. C.

i. 459 seq.). Moreover, they illustrate the belief that inanimate
objects also have spirits, which survive in another world. These
beliefs, which are the cause why so many of the treasures of our
museums are derived from ancient burial-places, prevailed both in
Mycenaean and in Homeric Greece; cf. <bibl n="Hom. Il. 22.510">Il. xxii. 510</bibl>

<p>For the tumuli generally of South Russia cf. S. Reinach, Introduction, 
Antiq. du Bosph. Cimm&eacute;r. (1892). The wealth they have
yielded is in the Hermitage at St. Petersburg, where the two rooms
(vii and x) of &lsquo;Kertch&rsquo; and &lsquo;Scythic and Siberian Antiquities&rsquo; have
over 20,000 gold objects, &lsquo;a collection unique at once for intrinsic
value and for historic interest.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The following points may be specially noted in c. 71. (1) It was
belief in H.'s veracity that led to the examination of the tumulus.
(2) As a rule the details minutely correspond, but (<foreign rend="ital">a</foreign>) other metals
beside gold were found in the tomb. This discrepancy may be due
to exaggeration on his part (or his informant's) or to the fact that
the tombs explored are later than his time; (<foreign rend="ital">b</foreign>) the number of victims
is two (not six). (3) The vault is of stone; of this H. says nothing,
though it perhaps implied the <foreign lang="greek">χῶμα μέγα</foreign> of &sect; 5. The sarcophagus
itself was of wood (as in &sect; 4). (4) Naturally no parallel has been
found to the fifty dead mounted slaves (c. 72); these were <emph>outside</emph> the

     Pontus       11,100         3,300 (<foreign lang="greek">τῇ εὐρύτατος</foreign>)

     Hellespont      400             7</p>
<p>H. is strangely wrong on the length of the Black Sea; the E. B.<hi rend="sup">9</hi>
gives it as 720 miles, i. e. about 6,280 stades; but this is at the
longest part, from the Gulf of Burghaz to near Bat&ucirc;m. At the
point measured by H. (86. 4) it is only about 650 miles. Various
explanations are given of his mistake:</p>
<p>(1) Rawlinson thinks H. is calculating from his own experience,
i. e. he took nine days and eight nights for a coasting voyage along
the south of the Black Sea, and was told that his vessel made 1,300
stades a day; but this explanation will not do, for H. is clearly
speaking of a direct voyage. Strabo (548) reckons such a coasting
voyage in the Euxine at &lsquo;about 8,000 stades&rsquo; only.</p>
<p>(2) Others think that a &lsquo;long day's&rsquo; journey (86. 1) was really
one of twenty-four hours (as modern ships reckon their &lsquo;runs&rsquo;);
H., forgetting this, reckons in the &lsquo;nights&rsquo; over again.</p>
<p>(3) The probable explanation, however, is much simpler. H.
reckons a &lsquo;long day&rsquo; and a long night; but it is obvious that in the
same twenty-four hours a &lsquo;long day&rsquo; presupposes a short night;
hence the figure &lsquo;600 stades&rsquo; for the night is exaggerated.</p>
<p>A normal twenty-four hours' run was 1,000 stades. For the
whole subject of a ship's speed cf. vii. 183. 3 nn.</p>
<p>It may be noted that the famous Massiliot navigator, Pytheas,
made the south coast of Britain nearly twice its real length.</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">εὖρος</lemma>. The E. B.<hi rend="sup">9</hi> gives the breadth of the Pontus as 380 miles
(about 3,310 stades), but this is in the wide west part. At the
points further east measured by H., it is only about &lsquo;270 miles&rsquo;
(<foreign rend="ital">ib.</foreign> = 2,350 stades). H. therefore is here again in excess, but
much less so than as to the length; in the shorter voyage there
was less room for miscalculation.</p></div3>
<div3 id="c.4.85.3" type="section" n="3">
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">τέσσερες στάδιοι</lemma>. The estimates for the breadth of the Bosporus
at its narrowest part, which is about the centre (where the bridge
was made, 87. 2), vary from 550 metres (about 600 yards; R&eacute;clus)
to three-quarters of a mile (E. B.<hi rend="sup">9</hi>): Murray's Guide agrees with
H. (as does Strabo 125), giving 810 yards.</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">μῆκος</lemma>. As the whole channel is meant, <foreign lang="greek">ὁ αὐχήν</foreign> is added to explain. 
H. underestimates the length, which is about 20 miles
(E. B.<hi rend="sup">9</hi>), i. e. 175 stades. Perhaps in estimating the speed of a
vessel sailing down the straits, he forgot to allow for the current.</p></div3>

geographical miles (i. e. about 1,100 and 430 stades). H. therefore
is too large here also.</p>

Murray's, who gives 1,400 yards; but Murray makes the length 33

<p>Rawlinson (<foreign rend="ital">ad loc.</foreign>) has a useful table of the measurements of H.,
Strabo, and Pliny, compared with actual distances. He notes (1)
that H.'s successors are hardly more accurate; (2) that as a rule
his measurements are in excess, because he overestimates the
speed of vessels; (3) that, as might be expected, he is most inaccurate

thinks it was accompanied by a map (which is most unlikely). H.
starts from the Ister, assumed as the western boundary. He first

<div3 id="c.4.99.1" type="section" n="1">
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">Σκυθικῆς γῆς</lemma>. H. means that the coast of Scythia does not continue 
(in a straight line that of Thrace), but that &lsquo;as there is a sweep
made&rsquo; (<foreign lang="greek">κόλπου</foreign>) the Thracian coast line &lsquo;projects&rsquo; (<foreign lang="greek">πρόκειται</foreign>), just
as Egypt projects (ii. 12. 1) beyond the line of North Africa.</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ἐκδιδοῖ</lemma>, &lsquo;runs out&rsquo; into it; i. e. has its mouth in it (cf. 49. 3 n.).</p>
<p>The lower course of the Ister is one of the most difficult points in
Herodotean geography. As Niebuhr pointed out (K. S. pp. 156, 356,
and map), H. conceives it as running due south (cf. Macan, vol. ii,
Map, and p. 18).</p>
<p>Niebuhr's arguments are: (1) The supposed correspondence of
Ister and Nile (ii. 33. 2 n.). (2) In v. 9 the land to the north of
the Ister is not Scythia or that of the Agathyrsi but &lsquo;desert&rsquo;, and
(v. 10, by implication) <foreign lang="greek">ὑπὸ τὴν ἄρκτον</foreign>. (3) Only in this way can be
explained the great extent of the Thracians (v. 3). (4) The western
boundary of Scythia (i. e. admittedly the Danube) runs at a right
angle to the coast (101. 3).</p>
<p>The last point seems decisive. Rawlinson says rightly that this
view, viz. that the lower Danube runs south, is inconsistent with
other parts of H., e. g. (1) the Danube receives from Scythia five
tributaries, each west of the other (c. 49); the boundary therefore
runs east and west, and not north and south; (2) the tributaries
from the Haemus flow in from the south (c. 50), so the Danube must
run east and west; (3) it runs into the sea &lsquo;with its mouth facing
south-east&rsquo; (<foreign lang="greek">εὖρον</foreign>). But (1) and (2) only prove either that H. did
not know these facts when he wrote c. 101, or, more probably, that he
<pb n="337"/>
forgot them from a love of symmetry; and if the emphasis be laid
on <foreign lang="greek">στόμα</foreign> (&sect; 1), is rather for the south course than against it. Why
mention the &lsquo;mouth&rsquo;, if the whole course were south-east?</p>
<p>Macan well suggests that H.'s mistake is helped by his confusing the
Danube and the Pruth, which latter river flows mainly north and south.</p></div3>

the Crimea, which he conceives of as resembling Attica, i. e. as a
triangular projection of Scythia, running south-east (&sect; 4). Strabo

small part of the Black Sea and the Cimmerian Bosporus (<foreign rend="ital">vid. sup.</foreign>)
with the Palus Maeotis and part of the Don. This last point is
proved (Rawlinson, iii. 203) from the movements of Darius' army
(cf. 120. 2, 122. 3), and from the fact that, though Darius marches
through the territory of the Sauromatae and the Budini, he never
gets far from Scythia (cc. 124, 125).</p>
<p>The story of the campaign is not history, but it is evidence for
the geographical conceptions of its author. Niebuhr and Stein are
therefore wrong in representing the Don as flowing into the Palus
Maeotis just at the north-east corner of Scythia, and thereby

the previous history of Miltiades cf. vi. 39-41 nn.</p>
<p>The part played by him is full of difficulty; if he openly purposed
to destroy the Great King, how did he so long escape Persian
vengeance?</p>
<p>Three explanations may be noted.</p>
<p>(1) That of Rawlinson may be rejected at once; he thinks that
Darius never knew who had proposed his destruction till Miltiades
himself boasted of his proposal after 500 B. C.</p>
<p>(2) The usual explanation (adopted on vi. 40, <foreign rend="ital">q. v.</foreign>) is that there
was treason talked at the bridge, and repressed by Histiaeus, but
that Miltiades had no part in it. Long after, however, when on his
trial for tyranny at Athens (vi. 104. 2), he claimed (falsely) to have
suggested this signal service to the cause of Greece. Thirlwall (ii.
393), who was the first to question the narrative here, thinks Miltiades'
first act of treason to Persia was the seizure of Lemnos. It is
pointed out that Darius returned to Asia through Miltiades' territory 
(143. 1; cf. <ref target="c.5.26" targOrder="U">v. 26 n.</ref>), and there is no hint in that passage that
the tyrant was disloyal.</p>
<p>(3) Grote argues (iv. 201), however, that it is dangerous to reject
a story as to events known to many and resting on nearly contemporary 
evidence. Hence he accepts the account of Cornelius Nepos
(<bibl n="Nep. Milt. 3">Milt. c. 3</bibl>), that Miltiades left the Chersonese at once after the
Scythian expedition, and did not return till the time of the Ionic revolt.
This suggestion agrees with the fact that Miltiades seems to have
served for a time as a condottiere with the Thracian prince Olorus,
whose daughter he married (vi. 39), and is confirmed by vi. 41. 3&mdash;
the importance attached to the capture of his son.</p>
<p>This arrangement of the facts can perhaps be reconciled with the
account in vi. 40, though it is odd that H. mentions there a flight
from the Scyths, and says nothing of this (supposed) previous
flight from the Persians, which Nepos (<foreign rend="ital">u. s.</foreign>) definitely mentions.</p>
<p>It may be suggested that Miltiades' sympathy with the Scyths was
<pb n="344"/>
of early date. There is a fine vase in the Ashmolean Museum
(dating about 520 B. C.) with the inscription <foreign lang="greek">Μιλτιάδης καλός</foreign>,
representing a handsome young warrior in Scythian costume
(cf. Helbig, Les <foreign lang="greek">ἱππεῖς</foreign> ath&eacute;niens, p. 199; P. Gardner, Greek Vases in
A shmolean, no. 310, pl. 13, who calls the costume &lsquo;Persian&rsquo;).</p></div3>

<p>(4) <hi rend="ital">The results of Persian intervention</hi> (cc. 200-5).</p>
<p>Many of the references to modern travellers are drawn from

passages in full. The comparisons are interesting and greatly to
the credit of H. as a sifter of evidence, especially when we remember
the proverbial unveracity of Oriental witnesses. &lsquo;Happy are they
who find the least resemblance between the description they have
heard and the reality, for it often occurs that amplification and
hyperbole have less to do in such accounts than pure invention.&rsquo;
Beechey (Expedition to North Coast of Africa, 1821-2, p. 503), who

Pheretime (c. 202), which is quite un-Hellenic.</p>
<p>Some see (e. g. Macan ii. 265) in the two stories of the Minyan
settlement in Laconia, and of the settlement of Cyrene, &lsquo;aetiological
legends&rsquo; explaining present facts; &lsquo;the former justified the Spartan
supremacy in Laconia; the second the Spartan claim over Thera&rsquo;
(cf. for this the similar legend as to Patrae, <bibl n="Paus. 3.2.1">Paus. iii. 2. 1</bibl>).</p>
<p>That the stories are unhistorical in form needs no proof; and it
may be the case that the real connexion between Laconia and Thera
dates at earliest from the seventh century (Studniczka, <foreign rend="ital">vid. inf.</foreign>).
But the only argument adduced (<foreign rend="ital">ib.</foreign> p. 51) is that the Spartan Dorians
were at first too weak to send out colonies. This is valid against
the Herodotean version of the facts, but has no bearing on the
wider question, the date of the Dorization of Thera; this may well
have been part of the same movement that Dorized the Peloponnese.
This earlier date is partly confirmed by the 700 years which the
Melians claim for their city in 416 B. C. (<bibl n="Thuc. 5.112.2">Thuc. v. 112. 2</bibl>).</p>
<p>The story of the two foun dations is examined by F. Studniczka
in a book (&lsquo;Cyrene&rsquo;, 1890) full of ingenious hypotheses, most of
which are unprovable and many of which are improbable. For his
summary cf. Roscher, ii. 1734 f. His main conclusions are:</p>
<p>(1) The fact that the legends always connect the nymph Cyrene
with Thessaly (pp. 39 f., 45) shows that the colonists came from this
part of the world.</p>
<p>(2) Their route was by Attica, as is shown by the occurrence of
Attic place-names in the island (p. 65; cf. Busolt, i. 353).</p>
<p>(3) The connexion of Dorians with Thera was later than the first
Messenian war, and led to troubles in Thera, and ultimately to the
expulsion of the original colonists, who go to Cyrene (cf. 156. 3 n.).</p>
<p>(4) Dorian encroachment spreads to Cyrene (p. 103, cf. cc. 159,
161), and ultimately leads to the expulsion of the royal house.</p>
<p>(5) Cyrene herself is a form of Artemis (cf. the name <foreign lang="greek">Θήρα</foreign>, p. 146),
who is degraded into a heroine; her worship is superseded when the
Cyrenian democracy is established (p. 173, cf. <bibl n="Aristot. Pol. 6.1319b">Arist. Pol. vi. 4, 1319 b</bibl>,
quoted on 161. 3).</p>
<p>(6) The connexion of the Minyae with Lemnos, their settlement
in Thera, and the connexion of Theras with Thebes are all cut out
as later inventions.</p>
<p>All these guesses and combinations are as devoid of real evidence
as the story in H.; they have the additional disadvantage of being
more than 2,000 years further from the facts.</p></div3>

non-Dorians here, connected specially with Thera.</p>
<p>Euphemus is turned by Studniczka (p. 116) into an euphemistic

who had killed their fathers and husbands (<bibl n="Apollod. 1.9.17">Apollod. i. 9. 17</bibl>);
Hypsipyle had spared her father Thoas (Ov. Her. 6. 135). The
later population of Lemnos was the result of their visit. For this
story cf. <bibl n="Hom. Il. 7.467-9">Il. vii. 467-9</bibl> (Euneos the Lemnian, a son of Jason).</p></div3>

of the later Spartan claim to be the heirs of Agamemnon (vii. 159. 1).</p>
<p>The legend also aims at emphasizing the connexion between
Lacedaemon and Thera. This story of admission to citizenship is

diverse views are held.</p>
<p><hi rend="bold">I. The Negative Argument.</hi></p>
<p>Beloch (Griech. Gesch. p. 75) maintains that the Phoenicians never
really settled in the Aegean, that their regular voyages to Greece did
not begin before the eighth century B. C. (p. 74), and that Minos,
Phoenix, Cadmus, Europa (p. 168) are all &lsquo;good Greek gods&rsquo;; the
<pb n="348"/>
sea empire of Minos is a mere inference from names, and &lsquo;Phoenix&rsquo;
is explained as a sun myth (&lsquo;the blood-red&rsquo;, p. 75).</p>
<p>The grounds for this ultra-scepticism are:</p>
<p>(1) That the Phoenicians do not appear in the oldest parts of
Homer; unfortunately for Beloch's argument, there is no general
agreement which are the oldest parts.</p>
<p>(2) The scanty traces of Semitic influence on Greek vocabulary;
even the words for sea-faring are native; Beloch contrasts Latin
borrowings in this department from Greek. Meyer, i. 476, gives a list
of words borrowed by Greeks and Semites from some common source.</p>
<p>(3) Cyprus was certainly influenced by the Phoenicians (cf. v.
104 nn.); but it lies outside the ordinary lines of Greek development.</p>
<p>Archaeology has already crushed one part of Beloch's negative
argument by proving the reality of Cretan sea-power, although it
has at the same time disproved the opposite view (Thirlwall, i. 141),
that the Cretan sea-power was Phoenician. With regard to the
rest of Beloch's argument, in spite of Reinach's warning against
&lsquo;Le Mirage de l'Orient&rsquo;, many scholars still believe that the
Greeks were to some extent right in attributing importance to
Phoenician influences in Greece. Meyer (ii<hi rend="sup">1</hi>. 89, 1893) wrote: &lsquo;The
voyages of the Phoenicians in their historical importance can be
compared with the discovery of America in the fifteenth century.
They introduced the sea into history.&rsquo; &lsquo;Many of the data (as to
their settlements in the Aegean) may be untrustworthy; to explain
them all as unhistorical is impossible&rsquo; (<foreign rend="ital">ib.</foreign> &sect; 90).</p>
<p><hi rend="bold">II. Evidence for Phoenician Settlement.</hi></p>
<p>The main kinds of evidence used for tracing the presence of
Phoenicians in Greece are (<foreign rend="ital">ib.</foreign> 91), apart from statements of ancient
historians:</p>
<p>(1) The evidence of names, both geographical (e. g. Mount
Atabyris in Rhodes compared with Mount Tabor; the river
Iardanus in Crete, Soli in Cilicia) and personal, e. g. the Corinthian
hero Melicertes (i. e. Melcarth). For other instances cf. Abbott,
History, i. 50; but this evidence is most uncertain.</p>
<p>(2) The evidence of remains, e. g. the beds of murex shells at
Cythera and on the Euripus.</p>
<p>(3) The evidence of family traditions, e. g. the priests of Poseidon
at Ialysus (Diod. v. 58), the family of Thales (i. 170. 3 n.).</p>
<p>(4) The evidence of cult; the ritual impurity of some of the cults
of Aphrodite may have been borrowed, or, at any rate, developed
(e. g. at Corinth; cf. <ref target="c.1.131.3" targOrder="U">i. 131. 3 n.</ref>) under Phoenician influence.</p>
<p>It must be admitted, however, that all these lines of evidence are
in themselves weak; it is only their cumulative force, coupled with
the danger of rejecting a tradition held by the Greeks so firmly, that
makes it safer to accept Phoenician influence in Greece as a fact.</p>
<p><hi rend="bold">III. Lines of Phoenician Influence.</hi></p>
<p>The following points may be suggested as to it:</p>
<p>(1) Phoenician trade and settlements, so far as they existed in
<pb n="349"/>
Greece, belong to the period immediately succeeding the downfall
of the &lsquo;Mycenaean&rsquo; civilization.</p>
<p>(2) They entered the Aegean by Rhodes (cf. the oriental objects
in the necropolis of Camirus, and <foreign rend="ital">u. s.</foreign> for Ialysus).</p>
<p>(3) From Rhodes one line of Phoenician influence went by
Crete and the Islands (cf. <bibl n="Thuc. 1.8.1">Thuc. i. 8. 1</bibl>) to Cythera (i. 105. 3), to
Corinth, and perhaps to Attica (cf. the story of the bull of Marathon);
the name of the deme Melite may be Semitic (cf. &lsquo;Malta&rsquo;). Another
line went up the east coast of Asia Minor to the Propontis and to
Thasos (cf. vi. 47. 2 for the Phoenician mines).</p>
<p>(4) Whatever view may be held as to Phoenician cult influences
(and these are generally accepted at Cythera and at Corinth), there
seems no doubt that the Greeks learned the purple fishery and the
art of mining from the Phoenicians.</p>
<p>(5) The alphabet was introduced from the East by them (v. 58 n.).</p>
<p>(6) But with one possible exception, what Thucydides says of Sicily
(vi. 2. 6) was in the main true of Greece proper&mdash;they occupied
<foreign lang="greek">ἄκρας τε ἐπὶ τῇ θαλάσσῃ . . . καὶ τὰ ἐπικείμενα νησίδια ἐμπορίας ἕνεκεν.</foreign></p>
<p>The exception just referred to must now be discussed.</p>
<p><hi rend="bold">IV. Was there a Phoenician Settlement in Boeotia?</hi></p>
<p>(For a full discussion of the evidence cf. B&eacute;rard, Les Ph&eacute;niciens et
l'Odyss&eacute;e, i. 224 f.) To the Greeks of H.'s time this was the most
important fact in the Phoenician story (ii. 49. 3; v. 57. 1); but it is
perhaps the most uncertain in the whole cycle of the legends.
Against the reality of Cadmus it may be argued:</p>
<p>(1) That an older myth attributed the foundation of Thebes to
Amphion and Zethus, the sons of a native nymph (<bibl n="Hom. Od. 11.262">Od. xi. 262</bibl>).</p>
<p>(2) That the supposed Phoenician features in the story, the guiding 
&lsquo;cow&rsquo; and the &lsquo;seven&rsquo; gates, are not original (cf. Busolt,
i. 252. n. 2).</p>
<p>(3) That the oldest story of Thebes has elements in it which are
clearly native, e. g. the &lsquo;earth-born&rsquo; <foreign lang="greek">Σπαρτοί</foreign> (Pind. Isth. i. 30).</p>
<p>(4) That though &lsquo;Qedem&rsquo; certainly is a Semitic word for &lsquo;East&rsquo;,
there is no parallel for the derivation of such a proper name as
&lsquo;Cadmus&rsquo;.</p>
<p>(5) That H. himself tells us that the Gephyraeans, whom he seeks
to prove Cadmeans, themselves believed they came from Eretria
(v. 57. 1).</p>
<p>On the other hand, the supposed priority of the non-Phoenician
foundation myths is by no means certain, and the improbability 
is great that later invention would settle on Boeotia for
the main Phoenician settlement in Greece. Geographical position, 
too, argues strongly in favour of the truth of the myth;
a Phoenician settlement in Boeotia commanded alike the
Euripus, the Corinthian, and the Saronic gulf, for Megara was
probably part of Boeotia in early times (cf. Strabo 405), and so
that district was, as Ephorus said (Strabo 400), <foreign lang="greek">τριθάλαττος</foreign>. As
<pb n="350"/>
B&eacute;rard (i. 226) well says: &lsquo;Continental Greece, under Franks,
Catalans, Venetians, had in Boeotia the centre of its commercial
routes.&rsquo; There was probably a trade-route from the Euripus to the
Corinthian gulf, past Thebes, Orchomenus, and Crisa, as well as
one over the passes of Cithaeron to the Saronic gulf. Hence it
would be at least possible that the Phoenicians made their chief
settlement in Boeotia.</p></div3></div>

<p>In this difficult district of Triphylia, between Elis and Messenia,
remnants of an earlier race maintained themselves; their centre
was the temple of the &lsquo;Samian Poseidon&rsquo; (Strabo 343). The most
important town was Lepreum, here put at the head of the list; it

Triphylians had been against them; the same alliances had been
formed at the end of the Second Messenian war (cf. Strabo 362 for
Triphylia). So Meyer iii. 285 puts this Elean raid soon after 470 B. C.;
he now (iv. 606), however, refers it to the period before the Peace
of Nicias, when the Lacedaemonians changed their policy, and

the jujube (<hi rend="ital">Zizyphus vulgaris</hi>) of the genus Rhamnaceae, to which
the English buckthorn belongs, with a fruit like a plum in size and
shape, which is eaten, especially when dried. The Egyptian lotus

<p>For a full discussion of the passages as to Lake Tritonis, and the
identifications proposed for it, cf. R. Neumann, pp. 28-59. The
following points may be especially noticed:</p>
<p>(1) H.'s own account is inconsistent; Tritonis is a lake, cf. 180. 3
<foreign lang="greek">περιάγουσι τὴν λίμνην κύκλῳ</foreign>; yet it is also part of the sea, for Jason
runs aground in it before he sees land (179. 2).</p>
<p>(2) H. knows nothing of the trend of the coast north here (cf.
181 n.) or of the Little Syrtis (Gulf of Gabes).</p>
<p>(3) While Scylax (110 <foreign rend="ital">ad fin.</foreign>) roughly agrees with H. as to the
position of the lake, Diodorus, in his story of the Amazons (iii. 53
seq.), transplants it far to the west near the ocean, while Strabo
(836) moves it east into Cyrenaica.</p>
<p>(4) Probably the original of Lake Tritonis is Lake Faroon, a large
shallow expanse, west of the Gulf of Gabes. H.'s informants knew
of its existence, but let their fancy fill in the details; later, when
under Roman rule this coast became better known, &lsquo;the story of
Lake Tritonis went on its travels&rsquo; again (R. Neumann, p. 58). WeldBlundell 
(B. S. A. ii. 114-18) thinks &lsquo;the legend records a commonplace 
physical fact&rsquo;, i. e. &lsquo;a north wind piling up the water on these

shoal coasts&rsquo;. He discusses the whole subject, and inclines to put
Lake Tritonis rather more north than Neumann&mdash;viz. off the Gulf
of Hammamet.</p>

<p>The description of North Africa as a triple zone of varying
character is a typical instance of H.'s merits and defects as a
geographer; for it cf. c. 174 and ii. 32. 4 seq. The Arabs still divide
<pb n="361"/>
North Africa into the Tell, the B&eacute;l&acirc;d el Dj&eacute;rid (&lsquo;the date region&rsquo;),
and the Sahara, and St. Martin (p. 16) says &lsquo;it is impossible to
describe in a way more exact and complete (than that of H.) the
successive belts which extend inland along the coast&rsquo;. The merits
of the division are that it roughly corresponds to marked natural
features, and that, in the absence of maps, it coordinates details into
a general conception. The coast line of Morocco, Algiers, Tunis,
and Tripoli is on the whole fertile, while the region behind (the
&lsquo;land of dates&rsquo;) is full of wild beasts, especially in the west. H.
knows this difference (191. 2). He does not expressly mention that
the west is hilly, but he casually speaks of <foreign lang="greek">τὰ ὄρη</foreign> in c. 194. The description 
seems to be a Carthaginian generalization, for it applies to
the west far more than to the east.</p>
<p>Its defects are obvious. (1) The zones are too continuous and
symmetrical (cf. H.'s own correction in 191. 3). (2) H.'s &lsquo;ridge of
sand&rsquo; between the &lsquo;beast region&rsquo; and the &lsquo;desert&rsquo; proper is a figment; 
the &lsquo;desert&rsquo; slopes away direct from the mountain block.
(3) H. has no conception of the extension of West Africa to the north;
Tunis is about 6&deg; north of Alexandria. Hence he makes a parallel
from Thebes to the Pillars of Hercules. (4) He confuses the caravan 
route from Thebes with that from Memphis, 300 miles to the
north. (5) His oases are far too regular in their intervals. No
doubt the symmetry is due to H.'s informants, who were describing to
him a familiar caravan route (Heeren); so Idrisi (an Arab geographer
of the twelfth century) gives the same figure.</p>
<div3 id="c.4.181.2" type="section" n="2">
<p>H. knows his distances are approximate (<foreign lang="greek">μάλιστα</foreign>), but he goes on
as if they were precise.</p>

masses&rsquo; above the ground, and as to the springs of fresh water in
the midst of it. But his general conception of an oasis as a &lsquo;hill of
salt&rsquo; (<foreign lang="greek">κολωνὸς ἁλός</foreign>, 182. 1) is quite absurd; no doubt he was misled
by the fact that salt then, as now, is a most important article in the
caravan trade; but he attempts to combine in an imaginary picture 
details that he has not seen, and naturally he fails. H. only
knows <foreign lang="greek">Ὄασις</foreign> as a proper name (iii. 26. 1 n.).</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ἀνακοντίζει</lemma>, &lsquo;shoots up.&rsquo; R. Neumann (p. 87) well points out
that the springs in the oases are &lsquo;very frequently artificially
arranged&rsquo;.</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">Ἀμμώνιοι</lemma>. The Oasis of Siwah (i. e. of Ammon) is twenty days'
journey from Thebes (not &lsquo;ten&rsquo;), twelve from Memphis; the latter
place was the usual starting-point for a caravan, and H. gives in
round numbers the average length of a journey. But his religious
instinct made him substitute &lsquo;Thebes&rsquo; for &lsquo;Memphis&rsquo;, as the &lsquo;ramheaded&rsquo; 
Zeus (ii. 42 nn.) is to him the god of Thebes.</p>
<p>This is the most natural explanation of his mistake; others (Stein)
suppose that a stage of the caravan journey has fallen out, the
&lsquo;Great Oasis&rsquo; (El Khargeh), seven days from Thebes. Others again
<pb n="362"/>
(e. g. R. Neumann, p. 99, who discusses the question fully), think there
is a confusion between the great shrine of Ammon at Siwah and a
less important one at Dachel, which really is &lsquo;ten days' journey&rsquo;

armaments and of Roman amphitheatres extirpated them north of
the desert, even as the modern big-game hunter is extirpating them
now all over Africa. H. is the first writer to use &lsquo;elephant&rsquo;

<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ἀσπίδες</lemma>. For the asp cf. ii. 74 n</p>

as monkeys; the &lsquo;dog-headed&rsquo; baboon is found in the mountains of
Africa, and the &lsquo;headless&rsquo; might be a kind of ape with its head so
sunk in its shoulders that its eyes seemed to be in its breast (Neumann). 
But it is more probable that these are monsters; so Pliny
(v. 46) certainly understood the passage; he says the &lsquo;headless&rsquo;
were called &lsquo;Blemmyae&rsquo;, and classes them with &lsquo;Satyrs, goatfeet&rsquo;,
and others. Aeschylus (in Strabo 43) wrote of the <foreign lang="greek">στερνόφθαλμοι</foreign>
(cf. note on <foreign lang="greek">ἀκατάψευστα</foreign> <foreign rend="ital">inf.</foreign>)</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ἄγριοι ἄνδρες</lemma>. The &lsquo;wild men&rsquo; are doubtless the &lsquo;gorillas&rsquo;, which
Hanno (G. G. M. i. 13, <foreign rend="ital">circ.</foreign> 500 B. C.) speaks of on the West Coast
of Africa; he brought three skins of females to Carthage.</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ἀκατάψευστα</lemma>. This passage is most important as a criterion of
H.'s credulity. R. Neumann (p. 155; cf. Introd. p. 44) thinks that
H. accepts all the creatures of &sect; 4 as &lsquo;beasts&rsquo;, but throws the responsibility 
for the account of them on the Libyans. But the last
three lines seem to deal with &lsquo;men&rsquo;, not beasts.</p>
<p>It is better, therefore, to suppose that the <foreign lang="greek">ὡς δὴ . . . Αιβύων</foreign> marks
off the <foreign lang="greek">κυνοκέφαλοι</foreign> and the <foreign lang="greek">ἀκέφαλοι</foreign> as creatures for which H. disclaims 
any responsibility; he simply reports, and in <foreign lang="greek">ἀκαταψευστά</foreign>
clearly hints disbelief.</p>
<p>At any rate it is significant that the qualifying words do not refer
to the <foreign lang="greek">ἄγριοι ἄνδρες</foreign>, for whose existence there was real evidence at
Carthage (i. e. Hanno's, <foreign rend="ital">v. s.</foreign>).</p>
<p>Stein well compares <bibl n="Aristot. HA 606b">Arist. H. A. viii. 28, 606 b</bibl>; the animals of
Africa are <foreign lang="greek">πολυμορφότερα</foreign>; hence the proverb <foreign lang="greek">αἰεὶ Αιβύη φερει τι
καινόν</foreign>.</p>
<p>It is instructive to compare Ctesias (Ind. c. 20, p. 252), who gives
a long account of the <foreign lang="greek">κυνοκέφαλοι</foreign>; they are a tribe 120,000 strong,
who cannot talk, but understand what is said to them!</p></div3></div>

He (rightly) does not consider the evidence sufficient to prove that
gold dust is skimmed from a pool. But &lsquo;anything may happen&rsquo; in
remote places, as well as &lsquo;in long periods of time&rsquo; (v. 9. 3). Hence

miles from the town; the one in use at the time of his visit (1805)
was much smaller than that of H.; but near it there is a &lsquo;spot with
which his description seems in every respect to correspond&rsquo;.
Dodwell further describes the sea as being coloured by the pitch
for some distance from the shore (cf. &sect; 4). Chandler (Travels in
Greece, 1776, p. 302) describes the method of obtaining the pitch
as being exactly that of H., and Dodwell partly confirms this.</p>

the Battiads by Cyrenaean vanity. Menecles (F. H. G. iv. 449,

of the royal house suits well the prominent part which she plays in

<p>The identifications of foreign with Greek or Roman deities, common 
in classical authors, are usually misleading. In the cases,
however, of Ares and Dionysus we have other evidence of their
Thracian extraction. Ares, the half-barbarian war-spirit, holds
a secondary position in Hellas. Though his cult was very ancient
in several places (e. g. Thebes) he was generally thought to have
come from Thrace, whence his worship was derived in prehistoric
times (Roscher, <foreign rend="ital">s. v.</foreign>, Pauly-Wissowa, ii. 642). Dionysus, though the
name is probably Greek, had an oracle among the Bessi (vii. 111 n.).
His strange cult, prominent features in which are his connexion with
the under-world, the orgiastic ecstasy, &amp;c., had no great hold on
Greece in the Homeric age, and only won its way to a slow and
gradual recognition by becoming Hellenized and humanized. The
true home of Dionysus was in Southern Thrace between the Axius
and the Hebrus, where he had many local names, e. g. Sabazius.
His cult was closely related to the Cybele cult of the kindred
Phrygians (Rohde, Psyche, ii. 1; Ramsay on <foreign lang="greek">Μήν</foreign>, C. and B. i. 105;
and in general, Farnell, G. C. v. 85 f.).</p>
<p>Artemis (cf. iv. 33) is probably Bendis, worshipped even at
Athens (Plat. Rep. i. 1. 327 A; <bibl n="Xen. Hell. 2.4.11">Xen. Hell. ii. 4. 11</bibl>), or the kindred
Edonian war-goddess Cotys or Cotytto (Strabo, p. 470). Both may
be connected with the great Mother of Asia Minor, a goddess of
fertility of whom the Ephesian Artemis is a form; cf. Append. I and
Farnell, G. C. ii. 473 f., 587 f.</p>
<p>Hermes appears to have been the chief of the Cabiri (Roscher,
Myth. Lex. 2360); with his cult compare the Gallic (Caesar, B. G.
vi. 17; Rhys, Hibbert Lectures, pp. 5-20 and ch. iv) and German
(Tac. Germ. 9) worship of Mercurius. The latter, Odin, would seem
to be like Hermes a wind god, and this may be true also of the
Thracian deity. It seems improbable that the Thracians were content 
with so small a pantheon. Indeed, even according to H., some of
them worshipped the Cabiri (ii. 51 n.) and others Salmoxis (iv. 95 n.).</p></div>

petty princes content to submit to Persian suzerainty. But later
(<foreign lang="greek">ὕστερον τούτων</foreign>), after the defeat of Xerxes and Mardonius (480-79

Mygdonia and Bisaltia, till it reached the Strymon (<bibl n="Thuc. 2.99">Thuc. ii. 99</bibl>).
He then acquired the rich mine here mentioned, probably just east
of Mount Dysorus. Southward of this, in Bisaltia, gold and silver
were plentiful (cf. 11 n.; vi. 46; vii. 112; ix. 75). Hence he adopted
the Bisaltian type and standard of coinage, merely substituting his

<p>The mutual relations of the Persian officials in Asia Minor are
obscure (cf. App. VI; Abbott, H. v, vi, Exc. i).</p>
<p>(1) Though Herodotus divides Asia Minor west of the Halys into
<emph>three</emph> satrapies&mdash;the Ionic, the Lydian, and the Phrygian (iii. 90, 127),
we hear of only <emph>two</emph> capitals&mdash;Sardis (&Ccedil;parda, cf. iii. 120) and
Dascylium, as in Thucydides. Again, Thucydides clearly recognizes 
only two principal satraps&mdash;Pharnabazus and Tissaphernes,
Tamos, governor of Ionia, being a mere lieutenant of the latter
(<bibl n="Thuc. 8.31">Thuc. viii. 31</bibl>, 87). Similarly, in Herodotus, Oroetes, Satrap of
Sardis (iii. 120), resides at Magnesia in the Ionic satrapy (iii. 122),
and after slaying the satrap of Dascylium, holds all three satrapies
(iii. 126, 127). Further, had he not from the first ruled Ionia, why
should he have been taunted with the independence of Samos?
(iii. 120). It would seem then that the Ionic satrapy, though
distinct for financial purposes, was governed from Sardis.</p>
<p>(2) The generals seem at this time to have been quite distinct from
the satraps. In the Ionic revolt the <emph>three</emph> generals are said to have
districts (<foreign lang="greek">νομοί</foreign>, v. 102), and divide the revolted towns among themselves 
(v. 116). Nevertheless Daurises moves from the Hellespont
to Caria (v. 117), while Hymaees takes his place on the Hellespont
(v. 122), and Otanes joins Artaphrenes in attacking Ionia and Aeolis
(v. 123). Thus Otanes (never styled governor) would seem to have
been a purely military official (vii. 135), successor to Megabazus in
the generalship (v. 26), while Artaphrenes is throughout satrap of
Sardis (v. 25) with supreme authority (v. 30), especially in matters
of finance (vi. 42). Indeed, it is implied (v. 30, 32) that his
authority is superior to that of the general; cf. Meyer, iii. &sect; 43.
Lastly, Mardonius (vi. 43) would seem to have had a special commission 
from the king with fuller powers, as had the younger Cyrus
(<bibl n="Xen. Hell. 1.4.3">Xen. Hell. i. 4. 3</bibl>).</p>

it is clear they had revolted against Darius (cf. 27) after the disaster

is confirmed by the fact that Darius, who had crossed to Europe
over the Bosporus (iv. 85), returned by the Hellespont (v. 11 n.).
Perinthus may perhaps be added to the rebels (cf. v. 1).</p>
<p>Antandrus and Lamponium were Lesbian colonies north of the
gulf of Adramyttium. Apparently they had shaken off the yoke of
Mytilene, but were now reconquered and remained later subject;

<p>The text is plainly faulty. Most editors follow Valckenaer in marking

the author then added <foreign lang="greek">οἱ μὲν δὴ Λήμνιοι . . . τελευτᾷ</foreign> as a marginal
note (cf. ix. 83); finally, when these got thrust into the text, the
gloss <foreign lang="greek">αἰτίη . . . κατεστρέφετο</foreign> was inserted to mend the damaged construction. 
But this betrays its origin by its inadequacy. In any
case it is clear that the last lines of this chapter must be connected
with ch. 26. Lycaretus had hoped to succeed his brother Maeandrius

great tyrant Thrasybulus, Periander's friend and ally (i. 20, v. 92),
whose sea-power and greatness H. recognizes. Thrasybulus may
have owed his power in part to an uprising of the poor subject
Carians, known as Gergithes (Athenaeus, p. 524 a, b), against the
dominant Hellenic immigrants. The &lsquo;two generations&rsquo; of faction
represent the interval between the two tyrannies, when Miletus and

Artabazus to further the conduct of the negotiations. Herodotus is
repeating a doubtful oral tradition, while Thucydides based his
narrative on Pausanias' own letter, irrefutable evidence, if genuine.
Again, Thucydides has not the faintest doubt of Pausanias' guilt,

<p>It seems clear that the revolt began with the arrest and deposition
of the tyrants, which must therefore be placed in 499 B. C. in
the sixth year before the fall of Miletus (494 B. C.; cf. vi. 18). But
while the events of the triennium between the fall of Miletus and
the battle of Marathon are clearly dated by Herodotus (cf. Macan,
App. VI), the chronology of the Ionic revolt is vague, the only fixed
point being supplied by Thucydides' statement (iv. 102; cf. ch. 126 n.)
that Aristagoras' death took place sixty years before the foundation
of Amphipolis. Very possibly Macan is right in cutting down the
length of the siege of Miletus to a single year (with E. Curtius) and
in allowing a longer period to the revolt in Cyprus and Aeolis. But
his scheme (App. V) is rather a correction than an interpretation of
Herodotus. Busolt (ii. 548 n. 7) presses into the service of chronology
fanciful anecdotes about Darius at Susa, and thus crowds the events
above assigned to 498 and 497 into 498, and makes the siege of Miletus
last 3 years, 497-4. Munro (C.A.H. iv. 232-3) suspects H.'s curiously
explicit chronology of 493-1 B. C. and doubts if any of the events
assigned to 491 B. C. are rightly dated. He places Marathon in 491.</p>

That a Persian of the blood royal should by treachery ruin a project

remain thereafter in high favour (32 n.), hardly credible. Nor are

<p>Grundy (p. 84 f.) sees in this incidental reference to conspirators
an indication that the plan of revolt had been made before the
expedition to Naxos. He holds that the other conspirators would
never have admitted to their councils a tyrant in the Persian interest,
who had just been engaged in an attempt to enslave a free Greek
island, unless he had been beforehand implicated in the conspiracy:
nor could Aristagoras have ventured to ask for aid in European
Greece, unless he had some defence to offer for the attack on Naxos.
He further points out how improbable it is that Megabates (cf. 33 n.)
betrayed the intended expedition to the Naxians, and suggests that
Aristagoras was the real culprit. On these and other grounds he
forms the hypothesis that the object of Aristagoras in proposing the
expedition was to bring about the mobilization and concentration
of the Ionian fleet, the only possible means of securing that combination 
between the Greek cities necessary for the success of
a revolt. But, as he admits, proof is impossible. Herodotus, by
the inconsistencies and prejudices (97 n., 124 n.; vi. 3 n.) visible in
his account, lays himself open to damaging criticism, but the reconstruction 
proposed has no secure basis. Patriotic Greeks in
Ionia or Europe might gladly welcome the man who had seen the
error of his ways and renounced Medism and Tyranny. Naxos
may have been warned without Aristagoras' intervention, and it is
quite after the manner of H. to introduce us suddenly to a fully
fledged conspiracy without telling us exactly the steps by which it
was formed. In fine, while we may legitimately doubt the fairness
and accuracy of H., we have no sufficient grounds for rewriting the
whole story. Discontent with the Persian and the tyrant was
doubtless rife in Western Asia (ch. 124 n.); the means by which it was
brought to a head, and the motives of the agents, remain uncertain.</p></div3>

Telys declared war and marched on Croton with an army 300,000
strong (Strabo 263). It is curious that H. does not regard the
fall of Sybaris as a judgement on the Achaeans for driving out their
Troezenian fellow colonists. <cit><bibl n="Aristot. Pol. 5.1303a">Ar. Pol. v. 3. 11, 1303 a</bibl> <quote lang="greek">plei/ous

This conjecture would be confirmed if the inscription, Ras Melkart,

<p>The description of this &lsquo;Royal road&rsquo; may come directly, like
the map of Aristagoras, from some Ionian geographer, but the
distances, in parasangs and stages (cf. <bibl n="Xen. Anab. 1.2">Xen. Anab. i. 2 </bibl>f.; Ctesias,
Pers. &sect; 64, p. 80), must be derived from some official Persian document.
Roads of this kind united all the provinces of the empire with
its centre Susa. Their importance was rather military and political
than commercial, hence they were guarded at important points by
forts and garrisons (&sect;&sect; 2, 3; cf. 35. 3 n.), and studded at intervals of
a day's caravan journey (i. e. three to five parasangs), not only with
khans or caravanserais (<foreign lang="greek">καταγωγαί</foreign>, &sect;&sect; 3, 6) but also with royal post
stations (<foreign lang="greek">σταθμοί</foreign>, cf. <foreign lang="greek">ἄγγαροι</foreign>, viii. 98). For the Great Khan's roads
with &lsquo;sjambs&rsquo;, i. e. Horse-post houses or stations on them at
every twenty-five to thirty miles, cf. M. Polo, Bk. II, ch. 26, i. 433 f.
The general descriptions of such roads by Ctesias (<foreign rend="ital">loc. cit.</foreign>) and
Amyntas (Athen. 529 e) are lost; Xenophon (Anab. i, ch. 2 and
4) gives details about one, which, unlike that of Herodotus, kept
south of the great salt-desert (cf. &sect; 1 n., ch. 54 n.). But the Royal
road here from Sardis to Susa is far older than the Persian empire.
Its immense d&eacute;tour to the north between Sardis and the Euphrates,
and the fact that Sinope not Amisos was in early times the terminus
<pb n="22"/>
of the caravan-route from the East to the Euxine, point unmistakably 
(Ramsay, A. M. &sect;&sect; 2, 3) to the existence of a great capital
at Pteria [Boghaz-Keui; cf. <ref target="c.1.76" targOrder="U">i. 76 n.</ref> and for recent discoveries there
E. Meyer, i, &sect;&sect; 474, 478 f.; Hogarth, Ionia and the East, ch. 4].
To connect this Hittite capital in Cappadocia with Sardis and the
Aegean on the one hand, and with Assyria and Babylon on the
other, was the original purpose of the roads which later formed the
&lsquo;Royal road&rsquo;. (See note, p. 415.)</p>
<div3 id="c.5.52.1" type="section" n="1">
<p>From Sardis to the Halys, through Lydia and Phrygia, is
reckoned at 94 1/2 paras. = 2,835 stades. This distance agrees
fairly with the route sketched by Ramsay (<foreign rend="ital">op. cit.</foreign>), amplifying and
improving on Kiepert (Monatsb. Berl. Akad. 1857). The way would
be by Satala to Akmonia, or to Keramon Agora. Then to avoid
the salt-desert, which spreads over the centre of the peninsula
(cf. &sect; 1 <foreign lang="greek">διὰ οἰκεομένης τε ἡ ὁδὸς ἅπασα καὶ ἀσφαλέος</foreign>), the road curved
northward by the city of Midas, Pessinus, and Gordium to
Ancyra (cf. J. H. S. xix, p. 50 and map) and the bridge over the Halys.</p></div3>
<div3 id="c.5.52.2" type="section" n="2">
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ὁ Ἅλυς</lemma>. The gates and guardhouse at the crossing of the Halys
may be held to imply the bridge (mentioned in i. 75. 3), especially as
H. here writes <foreign lang="greek">διεκπερᾶν</foreign>, not <foreign lang="greek">διαπορθμεῦσαι</foreign> as in &sect; 4. The Halys is
fordable in summer at Tchikin Agal and Eccobriga, but communications 
are cut by floods in winter (Ramsay, A. M. 256 n.), so
a bridge would be necessary if the route was to be in constant use.
Herodotus had no accurate information about the Halys apart
from the Royal road, and clearly did not know that if the road
(as he rightly states) crossed the Halys once between Ancyra and
Pteria, it must of necessity do so again on its way to the Euphrates,
either between Pteria and Caesarea Mazaca, or, on Kiepert's
hypothesis (<foreign rend="ital">v. i.</foreign>), at Sebasteia (Siwas).</p>
<p>The distance along the Royal road between the Halys and the
Euphrates is reckoned at 104 + 15 1/2 parasangs = 3,585 stades,
which is far too great for anything like a direct road from the
bridge on the Halys to Melitene (Malatia) or Samosata (Samsat).
Kiepert therefore rightly argued that the road must have made
a considerable circuit, but he seems to be wrong in declaring that his
d&eacute;tour must have been to the North and in taking the road round
from Tavium by Zela and Comana Pontica to Sebasteia, to meet
a route from Sinope. To touch Cilicia the road must have curved
southward and then run eastward along the Melas (Tokma Su) to
Melitene.</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">διξὰς πύλας</lemma>. The geography of Herodotus is reduced to hopeless
confusion if these be identified with the well-known Cilician gates
(Xen. An. i. 2. 21) between Tyana and Tarsus. Ramsay (C. B. I.
xiv n.) and Anderson (cf. <foreign rend="ital">inf.</foreign>) hold Herodotus guilty of this confusion. 
But his Cilicia extended north of Taurus (iii. 90 n.), and his
gates should be placed further east.</p></div3>
<div3 id="c.5.52.3" type="section" n="3">
<p>To meet the difficulty that the road passes for three days'

journey through Cilicia, Hogarth (Macan, ii. 299 f.) ingeniously
suggested that the road did not cross the Euphrates at Tomisa
(Isoli), but turned south by Kiakhta to the crossing at Samosata.
He points out that the distance from the spine of Taurus to the
Euphrates is three days' journey, that monuments of all ages
abound along this route, and that Samosata was early of importance. 
He also appeals to Artemidorus' account (Strab. 663) of the
<foreign lang="greek">κοινὴ ὁδός</foreign> from the east as corresponding to the Royal road here.
J. G. Anderson (J. H. S. xvii. 41) disputes this correspondence, and
argues forcibly that the hilly district north of Mount Masius is far
more suitable for a great road than the desert to the south of it,
through which a road crossing at Samosata must pass. Further, the
56 1/2 parasangs assigned to Armenia correspond to the real distance
from Tomisa on the Euphrates to the junction of the two streams
forming the Tigris (Kiepert), while no geographer includes the
desert south of Mount Masius in Armenia.</p></div3>
<div3 id="c.5.52.5" type="section" n="5">
<p>The insertion of some such words as those proposed by de la
Barre (l. 25) <foreign lang="greek">καὶ τριάκοντα . . . ἕκατον</foreign> is requisite to make the totals,
given by Herodotus himself (ch. 53), 111 stations and 450 parasangs, 
square with the items, which otherwise only amount to
81 stations and 313 parasangs, and to remove the anomaly that in
the case of the Matieni alone the number of parasangs is omitted.
Further, with the correction the number of parasangs from the
southern border of Armenia to Susa (179 1/2) agrees with the real
distance from the passage of the Tigris, which is as the crow flies
about 165 parasangs. The difference is little enough to allow for
crossing two ranges of mountains, the Carduchian on the upper
Tigris, and the pass between the valley of the Gyndes (Diyala) and
that of the Choaspes (Kerkha). But the correction of this corrupt
passage can hardly stop here. Stein urges the transposition of the
words (ll. 25-7) <foreign lang="greek">ἐκ δὲ ταύτης [τῆς Ἀρμενίης] . . . τέσσερες</foreign> with de la
Barre's addition (<foreign rend="ital">v. sup.</foreign>) to l. 18, after <foreign lang="greek">αὐτοῖσι</foreign>, on the ground that the
four rivers&mdash;the Tigris, the two Zabs, and the Gyndes, must be placed
in Matiene and not in Armenia, since otherwise Herodotus is not
only flagrantly wrong in his geography but also inconsistent with
himself (cf. &sect; 4, i. 189, 202). If so, <foreign lang="greek">τῆς Ἀρμενίης</foreign> is a gloss added
when <foreign lang="greek">ἐκ δὲ ταύτης</foreign> got severed from its original context. On this
supposition Matiene here (Meyer, iii, &sect; 89 n.) includes the greater part
of the land usually known as Assyria, but called by Xenophon,
Media (Anab. ii. 4. 27; iii. 4. 7, 5. 14). For the various senses

every fourth year, in the third year of the Olympiad, probably
24-28 Hekatombaion. The chief day, here called the Panathenaea,

<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">Γεφυραῖοι</lemma>. H. rejects the family tradition in favour of a fanciful
conjecture resting on the hypothesis that the Gephyraeans were
Cadmeians, and Cadmus a Phoenician immigrant. Perhaps he
connected Gephyra, the other name for Tanagra (cf. Strabo 404,
Steph. Byz.), with Gephyrae in Syria, and was thus led to derive
the Gephyraeans from Phoenicia (Petersen, de hist. gent. Attic.
p. 6 f.), or he may have misinterpreted the name of Phoenix, the
tutor of Achilles, who dwelt at Eleon (ch. 43 n.) near Tanagra,
and thus have imagined a connexion between the men of Tanagra
and Cadmus &lsquo;the Phoenician&rsquo; (Toepffer, Attic Geneal. 293 f.).
In any case the name <foreign lang="greek">Γεφυραῖοι</foreign> seems to be derived from <foreign lang="greek">γέφυρα</foreign>,
a bridge or dyke, as <foreign rend="ital">pontifex</foreign> from <foreign rend="ital">pons</foreign>; and even if Cadmeian
Thebes be a Phoenician settlement (cf. <ref target="c.4.147.4" targOrder="U">iv. 147. 4 n.</ref>), there is no reason

<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">γράμματα</lemma>. H.'s theory that the Greek alphabet, as he knew it,
was of Phoenician origin is borne out by comparing the forms,
names, and order of the early Greek and Phoenician letters
(Roberts, Greek Epigraphy, &sect; 4 f.). It contrasts favourably with
the ascription of the invention to mythical heroes, such as
Palamedes (Stesichorus), Prometheus (<bibl n="Aesch. PB 460">Aesch. P. V. 460</bibl> f.), Musaeus,
Orpheus, or Linus. Of course H. Knew nothing of the primitive
Cretan and Mycenaean scripts (A. J. Evans, J. H. S. xiv, xvii,
and Scripta Minoa), which being earlier must probably have
contributed to the formation of the Phoenician alphabet. His
connexion of the earliest Greek alphabet with Cadmus and
Boeotia is simply a part of his theory of Phoenician settlement,
as is the hypothesis that it spread first among Ionians. H. has
not the learning to distinguish the alphabets of Eastern and of
Western Hellas, or to recognize that the Ionic alphabet in its
final form is a late development of the former.</p>

<p>H. seems unaware of the three most important modifications:</p>
<p>(1) The utilization of some Phoenician consonants, <foreign rend="ital">aleph</foreign>, <foreign rend="ital">he</foreign>,
<foreign rend="ital">yod</foreign>, <foreign rend="ital">ayin</foreign>, to represent the vowels <foreign rend="ital">a</foreign>, <foreign rend="ital">e</foreign>, <foreign rend="ital">i</foreign>, <foreign rend="ital">o</foreign>, with the subsequent
addition of <foreign rend="ital">u</foreign>, <foreign rend="ital">&emacr;</foreign>, and <foreign rend="ital">&omacr;</foreign> (Roberts, &sect; 5).</p>
<p>(2) The evolution of double letters, the three new ones being
<foreign rend="ital">ph</foreign>, <foreign rend="ital">ch</foreign>, <foreign rend="ital">ps</foreign> (Roberts, &sect;&sect; 9, 11).</p>
<p>(3) The disappearance of certain unnecessary sibilants (Roberts,
&sect; 6). H. does, however, record the survival of San alongside
of Sigma (cf. <ref target="c.1.139" targOrder="U">i. 139 n.</ref>).</p>
<p>Clearly his interest is more in the form than in the sound of
the letters. Yet though he records (ii. 36. 4 n.) that Egyptian
writing went from right to left, he is clearly unaware that the
same is true of the Phoenician, and of the earliest Greek inscriptions 
(Roberts, &sect; 4, No. 1), nor does he notice the transitional

the opening of Egypt to foreigners by Psammetichus (ii. 154 n.) circ.

employed for keeping accounts when the Erechtheum was being

<p>Amphitryon, the human father of Heracles (ii. 44), was son of

Alcmene and uncle of Amphitryon. Amphitryon later accidentally
killed his uncle and fled with Alcmene to Thebes to be purified.
But before she would marry him she exacted a promise that he

(ch. 66. 2, 69. 1) nor, like the Pisistratidae, immigrants from Pylos

rebuilding it was 300 talents and subscriptions were solicited from
all parts of Greece, and even from Amasis of Egypt (ii. 180 n.). [For
a similar national subscription to rebuild the temple destroyed in
the fourth century cf. <bibl n="Xen. Hell. 6.4.2">Xen. Hell. vi. 4. 2</bibl>; Frazer, Paus. v. p. 634.]
The collection, as might be expected, was a long business. It was
going on before the death of Amasis (526 B. C.), but the Alcmaeonidae 
did not begin their contract till 514 B. C., after their defeat at
Lipsydrium (<bibl n="Aristot. Ath. Pol. 19">Ath. Pol. 19</bibl>), and in all probability did not complete
the work till after their return to Athens (510 B. C.) (Philochorus,

<p>Herodotus emphasizes the liberality of the Alcmaeonids. The

they got control of a large sum of money by undertaking the contract, 
and used it to effect the expulsion of the Pisistratids. In the
case of a similar restoration at Delos (B. C. H. xiv. 389), half the
sum agreed on was given to the contractors when the contract was
signed, and four-tenths more when the work was half-done. It is
therefore possible (as alleged by Philochorus, <foreign rend="ital">l. c.</foreign>, and argued by
Wilamowitz, A. and A. i. 33 f.) that the Alcmaeonids misapplied the
contract-money, and subsequently after their restoration made
splendid amends by their magnificent rebuilding of the temple
(<bibl n="Pind. P. 7">Pind. Pyth. vii. 10</bibl>). But the story is late and may well be inspired
by envy and malice. The wealth of the Alcmaeonids seems to
have depended largely on their connexion with the East (cf. vi. 125),
not on landed estates, presumably now confiscated, in Attica. Their

far more splendid than tufa or limestone, of which most of the older
Greek temples are built. The French excavators at Delphi have
found near the east fa&ccedil;ade of the temple, buried under the Sacred
Way, two sets of archaic pediment-sculptures, one made of marble,
the other of tufa. So, too, the architectural fragments are partly of
tufa, partly of Parian marble, so far supporting H.'s account. Cf.

Spartan policy. For though the piety of the Spartans which made
them slow to send troops to Marathon (vi. 106) and against
Mardonius (ix. 7 f.) may have been genuine, it seems more likely
that their motive in this case was political, viz. the friendship
between the Pisistratids and Argos (i. 61; <bibl n="Aristot. Ath. Pol. 19">Ath. Pol. 19</bibl>). Policy

<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">κοινῇ  βασιλέα</lemma>. The Thessalians in foreign affairs often
acted in common (<bibl n="Thuc. 1.102">Thuc. i. 102</bibl>, iv. 78), but it seems unlikely that
there were real kings in Thessaly. The title is occasionally given
to the chiefs of the leading families, e. g. the Aleuadae of Larissa
(<bibl n="Pind. P. 10">Pind. Pyth. x. 3</bibl>; H. vii. 6. 2, but not in ix. 1. 1, 58. 1), and Orestes of
Pharsalus (<bibl n="Thuc. 1.111">Thuc. i. 111</bibl>). Here it seems to mean a general
appointed to command the national army, the <foreign lang="greek">ταγός</foreign>, though that
term is first explicitly used of Jason of Pherae (<bibl n="Xen. Hell. 6.1.8">Xen. Hell. vi. 1. 8</bibl>).
In Thucydides (iv. 78) the Thessalians are said to be under a close
family oligarchy (<foreign lang="greek">δυναστεία</foreign>), but probably this refers to the home
government of the various cities. In 431 B. C. the troops sent to

a perversion of this name. In that case the Cynosarges, a walled
<foreign lang="greek">τέμενος</foreign>, which contained a shrine of Heracles (vi. 116) and a
gymnasium for the <foreign lang="greek">νόθοι</foreign> of citizens, must be north-east of Athens
at the foot of Mount Lycabettus. The position assigned suits the
narrative in vi. 115 f., since the Persians in the bay could see the
victors of Marathon encamped on the hill, and so would naturally
put about and sail away (Frazer, Paus. ii, p. 193 f.). Recently,
however, Dr. D&ouml;rpfeld has argued that Alopece and Cynosarges
must have lain south of the Ilissus towards Phalerum, near the
church of S. Marina, and Sir C. Smith has excavated a building
south of the Olympieum on the bank of the river, which, on rather
slight grounds, he holds to be Cynosarges (Frazer, <bibl n="Paus. 5.493">Paus. v. 493</bibl> f.).
This would suit the present passage, as its natural meaning is that
the Spartans were ridden down in the plain between Phalerum and
Athens and driven back to their ships. Their fallen leader would
probably be buried near the spot at which he fell; hence, if Alopece
be Ampelokipi, we have to suppose that the Spartans had marched
past Athens, which is unlikely.</p></div3></div>

them to support his legislation. They had taken the lead in the

Opposed to them were the land-holding class, who hoped for an

<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">τετραφύλους ἐόντας Ἀθηναίους</lemma>. Ancient tradition rightly made
these four tribes not Attic by &lsquo;Ionic&rsquo; (ch. 69. 1; <bibl n="Eur. Ion 1575">Eur. Ion 1575</bibl> f.),
[whether they were borrowed by Athens from Miletus (Wilamowitz,
A. and A. ii. 241), or, as is more probable, were characteristic of
all purely Ionic states, since they are found in Delos (B. C. H. x.
473, xiv. 418), in Teos (C. I. G. 3078, 3079), Cyzicus (C. I. G. 3657,
3663-5), &amp;c.], deriving them from the four sons of Ion. The view
that they represent castes can hardly be maintained (Strabo 383;
<bibl n="Plut. Sol. 23">Plut. Sol. 23</bibl>). <foreign lang="greek">Αἰγικορεῖς</foreign> might indeed mean the &lsquo;goat-herds&rsquo; of
rocky Diacria, and <foreign lang="greek">Ἀργαδεῖς</foreign> might = <foreign lang="greek">Ἐργαδεῖς</foreign> (<bibl n="Plut. Sol. 23">Plut. Sol. 23</bibl>), and
mean either husbandmen or handicraftsmen, though even these
etymologies are uncertain. But <foreign lang="greek">Γελέοντες</foreign>, undoubtedly the true
form (C. I. G. 3078, 3664, 3665), remains a riddle. Some connect it
with <foreign lang="greek">γελᾶν</foreign> = <foreign rend="ital">splendere</foreign>, and see in it a class of priests and nobles,
while others, deriving it from <foreign lang="greek">γῆ</foreign>, make them peasant proprietors.
But the latter are elsewhere (Busolt, ii. 96), <foreign lang="greek">γεωμόροι, γεωργοί, ἄγροικοι</foreign>,
and there is no trace of a priestly caste in Attica, while the nobles,
Eupatrids, belonged to all four tribes. Again, the <foreign lang="greek">Ὅπλητες</foreign> can hardly
be the &lsquo;warriors&rsquo;, as in that case they would not come last in order,
while if they are turned into handicraftsmen, tool-makers, they
overlap the <foreign lang="greek">Ἀργαδεῖς</foreign>. It may be better with Maas (Gott. Gel. Anz.
1889, 803; 1890, 353 n.), to connect the tribal names with halfforgotten 
deities, the Geleontes with Zeus Geleon (C. I. A. iii. 2),
the <foreign lang="greek">Ὅπλητες</foreign> with <foreign lang="greek">Ὁπλόσμιοι, Ὁπλόσμιος</foreign> being a title of Zeus in
Arcadia, <foreign lang="greek">Ὁπλοσμία</foreign> of Hera in Elis, while a tribe in Mantinea is
<foreign lang="greek">Ὁπλοδμία; Αἰγικορεῖς</foreign> with <foreign lang="greek">Αἰγίς</foreign> (<bibl n="Eur. Ion 1580">Eur. Ion 1580</bibl>), and <foreign lang="greek">Ἀργαδεῖς</foreign> with
<foreign lang="greek">Ἄργος</foreign>, the god of light. In any case, if the tribes ever had been
castes or local divisions, no trace of the fact remained: they were
in the time of Cleisthenes based on descent. Cf. Busolt, ii. 98 f. For
the four Ionic tribes cf. Ramsay, Asianic Elements in Greek Civilization,

possession. The worship of the heroes gave a certain religious unity
to the new tribes; their statues stood together in the Agora at
Athens. Aristotle (Ath. Pol. ch. 21) tells us that the Pythia selected
the ten eponymous heroes of the tribes from a hundred names submitted

<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">καὶ οὗτος ὑπεριδὼν Ἴωνας</lemma>. H. seems to regard Cleisthenes as of
old Attic, as opposed to Ionic descent (ch. 62. 2 n.), and so likely to
despise Ionians as his grandfather despised Dorians. But the
motive is superficial and improbable. The Athenians still celebrated
the Ionic festival, the Apaturia (i. 147), and retained the old tribes
and phratries, at least for religious purposes. We also find Athens
claiming kinship with the Ionians (ch. 97; ix. 106) as their mother
city, and may attribute the contempt expressed for the Ionians, here
and elsewhere, to later prejudice reflected in H. (cf. <ref target="c.1.143" targOrder="U">i. 143 n.</ref>).</p>
<p>The true meaning of the reforms was very different. By breaking
down the old tribal organization, Cleisthenes was enabled to
strengthen the state by the admission of many new citizens (cf. <cit><bibl n="Aristot. Ath. Pol. 20">Ath.
Pol. 20</bibl> <quote lang="greek">a)podidou\s tw=| plh/qei th\n politei/an</quote></cit>, <cit><bibl n="Aristot. Pol. 3.1275b">Ar. Pol. iii. 2. 1275 b 37</bibl>

ch. 21), and to free it from the undue influence of the old families
and clans. [Cf. Aristotle's sagacious remarks (Pol. vi. 4. 18, 19,
1319 b) on the necessity of breaking up old associations and forming
new ones, when the franchise is extended.] By the wise choice of
a natural local division, the deme, as the basis of his scheme, and
the skilful distribution of the demes and trittyes among the ten
tribes (Ath. Pol. ch. 21, <foreign rend="ital">inf.</foreign> &sect; 2), he provided against the crying
danger of local factions, and also secured the permanence of his
institutions. Lastly, by making Athens the one place where members 
of a tribe gathered together from their different trittyes for
a common purpose, Cleisthenes elevated the city in the eyes of all its
citizens, new and old. He thus completed the work, ascribed in legend
to Theseus, but in reality left incomplete by Solon and Pisistratus,
the unification (<foreign lang="greek">συνοικισμός</foreign>) of Attica. For Cleisthenes' measures cf.
Busolt (<foreign rend="ital">op. cit.</foreign> 853 f.) and E. M. Walker in C. A. H. iv. 141-56.</p></div3>

<pb n="37"/>
but frees the text from the unlikely statement that there were exactly
one hundred demes. Such a round number is improbable since</p>
<p>(1) The demes were not now first called into being (cf. <foreign lang="greek">τοὺς δήμους</foreign>
and i. 60. 4, 62. 1; ix. 73. 2), but existed at least in the days of the
tyrants (cf. i. 60, 62 nn.), as may be seen from Pisistratus' <foreign lang="greek">κατὰ δήμους
δικασταί</foreign> (<bibl n="Aristot. Ath. Pol. 16">Ath. Pol. 16</bibl>) and the Hermae set up by Hipparchus (Ps.Plato, 
Hipp. 229 <foreign lang="greek">ἐπιγέγραπται λέγων ὁ Ἕρμης ὅτι ἐν μέσῳ τοῦ ἄστεος
καὶ τοῦ δήμου ἕστηκεν</foreign>).</p>
<p>(2) The number of the demes in Polemo's time (second century
B. C.; cf. Strabo 396) was 174, of which some 166 have been found
on inscriptions: even in the fifth century there must have been more
than one hundred.</p>
<p>(3) The supposed support of the number one hundred derived
from the &lsquo;hundred heroes&rsquo; fails, since the hundred heroes are
not the eponymi of the demes, but the indigenous worthies from
among whom the Pythia chose the ten eponymi of the tribes (<bibl n="Aristot. Ath. Pol. 21">Ath.

<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">οἱ πρυτάνιες τῶν ναυκράρων</lemma>: <foreign lang="greek">ναυκραριέων</foreign> (Stein, Abbott) would be

Anec. i. 283) for levying money and contingents for the army and
ships for the fleet (the name coming from <foreign lang="greek">ναῦς</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">κρά</foreign>, the root of
<foreign lang="greek">κραίνω</foreign>, Busolt, ii. 191). The notion that Solon first instituted 48
such naucraries (12 in each of the four Ionic tribes) is due to Photius'
misrepresentation of <bibl n="Aristot. Ath. Pol. 8.3">Ath. Pol. 8. 3</bibl>, where their pre-existence is
really implied. There is then no reason to doubt that the &lsquo;presidents 
of the naucraries&rsquo; (prob. = <foreign lang="greek">ναύκραροι</foreign>) were important officers,
but the statement that they were the supreme power in the state
(for <foreign lang="greek">ἔνεμον</foreign> cf. i. 59. 6; v. 92 <foreign lang="greek">β</foreign> 1) is directly contradicted by
Thucydides (i. 126), who rightly names the archons, in which he is
followed by Plutarch, Sol. 12 <foreign lang="greek">Μεγακλῆς ὁ ἄρχων καὶ οἱ συνάρχοντες</foreign>.
Aristotle (Ath. Pol.) rightly sees in the naucrari local officials
(ch. 21), succeeded by the demarchs, while the archonship is the
chief political office (ch. 13). The attempt of Harpocration to
reconcile Herodotus and Thucydides by identifying archons and
naucrari is a mere subterfuge contradicted by all other authorities;
nor is it likely that the archons were the presidents of the naucrari
as has been suggested. The true explanation of the passage is that
Herodotus, or his authority, is anxious to absolve the Alcmaeonid
archon, Megacles, from the guilt of the sacrilege by throwing the
blame on another board of magistrates. For his Alcmaeonid
leanings cf. vi. 121, and Appendix XVIII, &sect; 6.</p>

<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">τέθριππον</lemma>. The site of this monument is a standing puzzle to
archaeologists. That it was, as H. says, originally set up circ.
505 B. C. seems certain, and also that it was destroyed or removed
by the Persians in 480 B. C., so that the monument seen by H. was
a reproduction erected about 450 B. C.&mdash;not, however, on the
original site. The evidence is as follows. In 1887 a broken block
of Eleusinian stone, evidently a fragment of an oblong base, was
found in the ruins of a large building to the north-east of the
Propylaea, probably near its original position. On the block may
be seen, in letters belonging to the end of the sixth century B. C., the
words (Hicks 12; C.I. A. iv.<hi rend="sup">2</hi> 334 a) <foreign lang="greek">ὕβ]ΡΙΝΓΑΙΔΕς</foreign>, and below
<foreign lang="greek">ΤΟΝΗΙΓΓΟΣ Δ[εκάτην</foreign>. Previously, in 1869, a block of Pentelic
marble, also a fragment of a base, had been found with an inscription
in characters belonging to the middle of the fifth century (C. I. A. i.
334) to this effect: <foreign lang="greek">Αθ]ΕΝΑΙΟΝ ΕΡΛΜΑ[σιν</foreign>, and in the line below
<foreign lang="greek">ἵ]ΓΓΟΣ ΔΕ[κάτην</foreign>, to which has been added more recently a scrap
containing the syllable <foreign lang="greek">σαν</foreign> twice repeated. Both inscriptions are
clearly fragments of the dedication inscribed on the pedestal of the
chariot: in both each couplet formed a single long line. But in the
earlier the hexameters were transposed, the line referring to the
chains standing first, which shows that the original monument stood
near the chains hung on the wall, whereas the newer was near the
entrance of the Acropolis. In all probability the trophy was
restored after the conquest of Euboea by Pericles (i. e. 445 B. C.),
or after that of Boeotia at the battle of Oenophyta (i. e. 456 B. C.).
Either would be a suitable occasion for such a restoration. In
favour of the latter Hauvette (p. 51) urges that H., who must have
seen the new monument, since he (like Diodorus and the Anthology) 
quotes the verses in the new order, gives no hint that the
trophy had just been restored. The epigram is to be ascribed
to Simonides (Aristides, ii. 512; Dindorf) rather than to Agron
(schol. <foreign rend="ital">ad loc.</foreign>); cf. Bergk, Sim. fr. 162.</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ἀριστερῆς χειρὸς  πρῶτα ἐσιόντι ἐς τὰ προπύλαια</lemma>. These words
raise a further difficulty. Does H. mean the famous Propylaea of
Mnesicles finished in 432 B. C.? To this there are the following
objections: (1) Within the Propylaea there is no room for so large
a monument as the chariot would seem to have been. (2) On the
slope immediately in front to the left there is no suitable site.
<pb n="44"/>
(3) Pausanias (i. 28. 2) clearly implies that the chariot stood on the
Acropolis itself inside the Propylaea. We must therefore infer that
the restored chariot was moved when the new Propylaea of Mnesicles
was built, and that H. is referring to the open space in front of the
old Propylon. This gateway is still discernible behind the southwest 
wing of the Propylaea, set in the Pelasgic wall, and was probably
restored by Cimon after the Persian war (cf. D'Ooge, Acropolis,
pp. 72-7, 301 f., with fig. 7). No certain inference can be drawn
as to the date of H.'s sojourn or sojourns in Athens (cf. Introduction,

government against tyranny (cf. iii. 80 f. and Introd. &sect; 7). His

statement of the close relations between the political institutions

<bibl n="Aristot. Pol. 6.1321a">Ar. Pol. v. 4. 8, 1304 a; vi. 7. 1, 1321 a</bibl>). His prediction of military
success for democracy may be true in a short national struggle for

a career of conquest, still less to the maintenance of an empire

less than justice to the Pisistratid tyranny (cf. App. XVI, &sect;&sect; 5-8.)
But its successes were diplomatic rather than military, and H.'s
statements (cf. 66. 1) are comparative. Pisistratus, no doubt, laid
the foundations of the Athenian Empire, but the building was
greater than its foundations.</p></div>

her priestess <foreign rend="ital">damiatrix.</foreign> These names must be of Greek origin,
and seem to show that the Greek deity Damia migrated from
Tarentum, where the feast of Dameia was celebrated, to Rome,
and was there engrafted on the Italian Bona Dea = Fauna (Warde
Fowler, Roman Festivals, pp. 102-6). In any case it can hardly be
doubtful that these goddesses are concerned with the increase of
the fruits of the earth, and with child-birth in women. Their
worship resembled that of Demeter and Persephone in the raillery
practised at both by the women (ch. 83. 3 n.), in the throwing of
stones as a religious rite, and in the manner of sacrifice (<bibl n="Paus. 2.30.4">Paus. ii.
30. 4</bibl>, 32. 2). In the fact that the statues were made of wood we
may perhaps see a relic of the supposed fertilizing power of trees (cf.

three Dorian states were leagued against Athens. Epidaurus must
have been friendly to Aegina, otherwise it could have stopped the Argives 
or sent news to Athens. Wilamowitz-M&ouml;llendorff (A. ii. 280 f.)
has put forward a theory (somewhat discredited, like the sun-myths
of comparative mythologists, by its too frequent use) that this war
is a reflection into the distant past of incidents which really occurred
in the struggles between Athens and Aegina in the period of the
Persian wars. Undoubtedly the incidents, the landing of the
Athenians, and their defeat by the Argives and Aeginetans, are
more appropriate to that time, as is shown by the mention of
a trireme (ch. 85); but the feud between Athens and Aegina seems
really old, as is shown by the embargo on Attic pottery (ch. 88),
and on the Athenian side by Solon's substitution of the Euboic
standard for the Aeginetan in coinage, and by his prohibition of the
export of corn (Busolt, ii. 307). H. vaguely takes the story back
into the far past, when Epidaurus had lately been mistress of
Aegina and friend of Athens (ch. 83), when images were still made
of wood (ch. 82), and Attic women still wore Dorian dress (ch. 87. 3).
This early war between Athens and Aegina may well have occurred
(circ. 590-70 B. C.) when Athens, fresh from her victory over Megara,
was ready for a yet bolder enterprise. Internal seditions and
renewed troubles with Megara (i. 59 n.) may soon have checked
these wider ambitions.</p></div3></div>

<p>There were two types of Greek dress: &lsquo;the Ionic&rsquo;, used by the
natives of Asia Minor&mdash;Phrygians, Lycians, Carians, and the Greeks
who came in contact with them; and the Dorian, of which the
Corinthian is an unknown variety, the primitive national dress worn
by almost all Greeks except the Ionians. The Ionian chiton was
a long linen garment like a night-gown, with full sleeves to the
elbow, requiring neither brooch nor pin. The Dorian was a square
woollen cloth, with the upper edge folded down forming the diplois.
<pb n="49"/>
It was simply folded round the body and fastened at the shoulder.
The right side was thus left unprotected, unless this opening was,
as in the Canephorae of the Erectheum, sewn up. (But in all cases
a girdle was worn fastened round the loins, and under the girdle the
dress could be so arranged as to overlap.) This Dorian chiton
served for both outer and under garment, hence it is called <foreign lang="greek">ἱμάτιον</foreign>
(ch. 87. 2). There is great difficulty as to the dress of the Athenians
in early days. Homer includes them among the <foreign lang="greek">Ἰάονες ἑλκεχίτωνες</foreign>
(<bibl n="Hom. Il. 13.685">Il. xiii. 685</bibl>; cf. <bibl n="Thuc. 3.104">Thuc. iii. 104</bibl>, Hom. hymn), and the men of
Athens before the Persian wars wore long linen chitons (<bibl n="Thuc. 1.6">Thuc. i. 6</bibl>)
and fastened their hair with golden grasshoppers in the Ionian
fashion. It is therefore hard to believe that while the men wore
Ionian dress the women wore the Dorian, and that then each sex
changed its style of dress. The evidence of monuments seems to
show that in the early period of sculpture Ionic dress was common,
but that after the Persian wars the Dorian dress prevailed. See

and Geometric wares, some of the later red-figure style prevalent
after the Persian wars at Athens, but hardly any of the best period

other words, the embargo was rigorous circ. 550-480 B. C. See

led the opposition to the Spartan proposal, since she needed an independent

of her own freedom. On her southern border she was
already hemmed in by cities subservient to Sparta; were Athens
now to become a submissive subject of Lacedaemon, Corinthian
liberty and even Corinthian commerce would be menaced. Sosicles
may be an historical person, like the seven Persian conspirators
(iii. 80 f.), but his speech is incredibly inapt to the occasion, and is
no more historical than the political essays put in their mouths. The
one good point is the inconsistency of Sparta's hostility to tyranny
at home and support of a tyrant abroad, and this might have been
improved by recalling the Spartan suppression of tyrants (cf. Appendix 
XVI, &sect; 10). Of the stories told, that of Cypselus' childhood
is not in point, since it does not illustrate the evils of tyranny, nor
is there any attempt to show that a tyranny at Athens would injure
Sparta or her allies. H., even in his set speeches, does not cease to
be a story-teller, using the narrative style (<foreign lang="greek">εἰρομένη λέξις</foreign>) suitable to

saw in the Heraeum at Olympia a chest (<foreign lang="greek">λάρναξ</foreign>) of cedar, whose

hiding-place of Cypselus. This seems impossible, as a <foreign lang="greek">κυψέλη</foreign>, to
judge from the coins of Cypsela in Thrace, is a cylindrical jar, and
the chest seems, from the account of its carvings and inscriptions,
not to be earlier than 600 B. C. Probably the legend here given
arose out of the name Cypselus, but the magnificent coffer seen by
Pausanias may well have been, like the golden image of Zeus

on the stele in the Acropolis&mdash;Aristotle (<bibl n="Aristot. Ath. Pol. 17">Ath. Pol. 17</bibl>) states that
only Hippias and Hipparchus were sons of his lawful wife, while
Iophon and Hegesistratus, whose other name was Thessalus, were
born of an Argive. The best solution is due to Toepffer
(Beitrage, p. 251 f.). He holds that Hegesistratus, illegitimate by
birth, was afterwards legitimized under the name of Thessalus,
which name accordingly he bears later in Aristotle (<bibl n="Aristot. Ath. Pol. 18">Ath. Pol. 18</bibl>)

<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">Ἀλκαῖος</lemma>. Beloch (Gr. G. i. 330) holds to his peculiar opinion
(Rhein. Mus. xlv. 465 ff.) that this synchronism between Alcaeus
and Pisistratus is historical, and that there was no earlier war
between Athens and Mitylene. Toepffer, on the other hand,
follows Valckenaer in contending that H. here is recapitulating
episodically the earlier history of the quarrel, and is quite aware
there were two wars (Toepffer, Beitrage, p. 63, 240 f.); but E. Meyer
(ii, &sect; 402) rightly follows Grote in arguing that H. has unconsciously
confused (1) the struggles of the time of Alcaeus, (2) the award of
Periander, (3) the renewed wars in the times of Pisistratus and his
sons. H.'s chronology of the sixth century, frequently confused
and inaccurate (Appendix XV, &sect; 6; Abbott, Exc. xi), is in this case
self-contradictory. Periander's award cannot be later than 585 B. C.,
as he died about that time, and Hegesistratus was born after
Pisistratus had become tyrant at Athens, circ. 560-555 (<bibl n="Aristot. Ath. Pol. 17">Ath. Pol.
17</bibl>). We must then suppose that there was an earlier war in
which (circ. 600 B. C.) Alcaeus lost his shield, and Pittacus of
Mitylene, by the arts of the retiarius, vanquished the Athenian
Phrynon in single combat (Strabo 599, 600), a fact whose omission 
Plutarch (Moralia 858 B) ascribes to the malevolence of H.
This war was ended by the well-attested mediation of Periander
(Ar. Rhet. i. 15; Diog. Laert. i. 74) before 590 B. C., and left the
Athenians in possession of Sigeum. A memorial of their dominion
there is the Attic inscription on the stele of Phanodikos the
Proconnesian found there (Roehl, I. G. A. 492; Hicks, No. 8), which
must be as early as the first quarter of the sixth century (Roberts,
No. 42; Greek Epigraphy, p. 334). At some later time Athens lost
possession of Sigeum, but regained it during the last tyranny of
Pisistratus (circ. 535 B. C.).</p>
<p>The attempt of the Athenians to get a foothold on the Hellespont
before they were secure even of Salamis may be explained by the
great value of the Pontic corn-trade to an impoverished Attica
(<bibl n="Aristot. Ath. Pol. 2">Ath. Pol. 2</bibl>), and a desire to deprive Megara of this source of
wealth. For the expansion of Athenian power under Pisistratus cf.

<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">πολλοὺς  ἕνα</lemma>. The malicious suggestion that it was easier to

Throughout he treats the Ionic revolt as a scheme of desperate
adventurers fraught with evils to Hellas (&sect; 3, ch. 28, vi. 3). Yet on
his own showing the conquest of Greece was already projected at
the Persian court (iii. 134), and Athens in particular was plainly
threatened (chs. 73, 96). The action of Athens did but forestall an
inevitable attack, and facilitated later the formation of the Delian
confederacy (ix. 106 n.; viii. 3). Her fault lay not in supporting
the Ionians now, but in deserting them later (ch. 103).</p>

census gives the number of 21,000 for 317 B. C., but there is little
doubt that the numbers were greater in Periclean and even in
Cleisthenean Athens. The number of those receiving state pay
(<bibl n="Aristot. Ath. Pol. 24">Ath. Pol. 24</bibl>), and of those to be billeted on the allies (<bibl n="Aristoph. Wasps 708">Arist. Vesp.

444 B. C. (<bibl n="Plut. Per. 37">Plut. Per. 37</bibl>). Beloch (Bev. ch. 3) would put the number
of citizens in 431 B. C. at 35,000, and in 500 B. C. at 30,000; while
Meyer (F. ii. 179), who accepts the 29,000 hoplites (including
metics) stated by Thucydides (ii. 13) to have been on the musterrolls 
in 431 B. C., reaches much higher totals&mdash;55,500 for 431 B. C.
and nearly 50,000 for 500 B. C. This last estimate must surely be
exaggerated, but that of H. may be roughly correct. Of course,
no such number ever attended the Assembly, five or six thousand

<p>The long struggle between Chalcis and Eretria for the Lelantine
plain, which culminated in a war of pan-Hellenic importance
(<bibl n="Thuc. 1.15">Thuc. i. 15</bibl>), would seem to belong to the seventh century. The
war between the two principals was fought out with sword and lance
(Archil. fr. 4; Strabo 448) by their knightly cavalry (<bibl n="Aristot. Pol. 4.1289b">Ar. Pol.
1289 b 36</bibl>), the Thessalians helping Chalcis to gain the victory
(Plut. Mor. 760 f.). But the war was far more than a border feud:
it was a struggle between two rival commercial leagues. Eretria was
supported by Miletus, and probably by Megara and Aegina, while
Chalcis had the help of Samos and Corinth. In the far West,
Sybaris was allied to Miletus (vi. 21 n.), and Croton to Samos.
Probably the rival Euboean cities were the channels through which
the Eastern Greeks could trade with the West. Cf. <ref target="c.3.59.4" targOrder="U">iii. 59. 4 n.</ref>; Busolt,

of the tie between Eretria and Miletus. He also constantly affirms
that the expedition of Datis was directed against Eretria as well
as Athens (vi. 43, 94, 98 f.). Myres (J. H. S. xxvi. 96) connects
this activity of Eretria with its thalassocracy 505-490 B. C., and

from the Hittites, to Egypt, Crete, and Greece. It long held its own
against cavalry, since it was better suited for archers (e. g. Hittites
and Egyptians), and ages passed before men devised weapons and
armour suitable for use on horseback (Ridgway, pp. 481-2). But
the chariot is unknown in Greek warfare after Homer, since its use
in processions at Eretria (Strabo 448) proves nothing. Its survival
in Cyprus may be due to oriental influence: indeed, it is tempting
to see in the treacherous charioteers an oriental element in the population.

<p><hi rend="ital">Flight and death of Aristagoras.</hi> H., who consistently depreciates
the Ionic revolt (ch. 28, 97 n.; vi. 3 n.), naturally regards its authors
as untrustworthy adventurers. Aristagoras is moved to action by
his own financial difficulties, and fear of losing his tyranny (ch. 35).
He has a glib tongue to deceive the multitude (v. 97) and a bribe
for the Spartan king (v. 51), but he takes no active part in warfare,
e.g. in the march on Sardis (v. 99) or the expedition to Cyprus
(v. 108 f.). Here he is represented as a coward deserting those he
has led into danger. But it would seem probable that discontent
had been rife in Western Asia Minor since 512 B. C. (iv. 137), and
that there was a widespread movement against the local tyrants
imposed by Persia (v. 37), the message of Histiaeus (v. 35) being
merely the signal and the expedition to Naxos the opportunity for
a premeditated rising (cf. ch. 36 n.; Grundy, p. 84 f.). Aristagoras
may have been merely the mouthpiece of the general discontent or
<pb n="66"/>
the agent of Histiaeus, but the wide extent and initial success of
the revolt shows that it was something more than a plot of selfish

<p>It is worth noticing that H., who elsewhere insists on the part
played by Aristagoras (v. 28, 30 f., 98), here seems to regard the
intrigues of Histiaeus as not merely the occasion (v. 35, 124 n.) but
the cause of the revolt. Histiaeus was a man of wide ambitions
(v. 23 n., 106), but his aims are obscure. Anxious to escape from
his gilded captivity (v. 35), he has no policy but opportunist selfseeking. 
His earlier loyalty to Darius was interested (iv. 137 f.),
and apparently he would even now have been willing to re-establish
himself in Miletus (v. 106) as the great king's viceroy of Ionia.
Hampered by the opposition of Artaphrenes and by his exclusion
from Miletus, he escaped captivity or death in Chios by claiming to
be the author of the national revolt. Eventually distrusted by both
sides, he became a mere free-lance and perished miserably. For
a more favourable view of him, resting largely on conjecture, cf.

Daurises (v. 117), the Aeolic cities in the Troad by Hymaees
(v. 122); those in Aeolis proper probably shared the fate of Cyme
(v. 123). Only the island power of Lesbos is left to represent the
Aeolians. The Dorian cities are here and elsewhere in the Ionic
revolt conspicuous by their absence. Of the twelve Ionic cities,
Clazomenae was in Persian hands (v. 123), while Lebedus and
<pb n="68"/>
Colophon, which lie on the route from Clazomenae to Miletus, may
also have fallen. The men of Ephesus took little part in the revolt,
for though they furnished guides for the march to Sardis (v. 100),
they massacred the fugitive Chians (vi. 16). The small number
of Phocaean ships (three) shows how much that city was reduced by
the great emigration (i. 165-7); Samos, on the other hand, has
quite recovered after its devastation twenty years before (iii. 149).
The order is roughly geographical, but the Samians are posted on

absence in the battle of Sybota proving the inferior skill of the
Corinthian and Corcyrean navies (<bibl n="Thuc. 1.49">Thuc. i. 49</bibl>). It consisted in
breaking through the enemy's line, and then turning rapidly to ram
one of his ships on its defenceless side or stern. It demanded great
skill in the coxswain and efficiency in the oarsmen. It was met by
forming in a circle with prows outward (cf. viii. 11), a device which
proved useless against Athenian daring and skill (<bibl n="Thuc. 2.83">Thuc. ii. 83</bibl>),
or by drawing up the ships on the wings in a double line (<bibl n="Xen. Hell. 1.6.29">Xen.

<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">περὶ σωτηρίης</lemma>. Bury (Klio ii. 14 f.) shows that the only occasion
on which this epicene oracle is probable is during the visit of Aristagoras 
to Greece. The Argives, threatened by a Spartan attack
(ch. 77), consulted the oracle <foreign lang="greek">περὶ σωτηρίης τῆς πόλιος τῆς σφετέρης</foreign>, yet
the answer given concerns Miletus as much as Argos, though Miletus 
had not sent to inquire of Delphi. The answer of the oracle is
only explicable on the assumption that the Milesians had asked
Argos for help, and Argos had agreed to consult Delphi. We may
be sure that Aristagoras sought aid at other places besides Sparta
and Athens. Eretria sent five ships (v. 99), doubtless at his request.
What more natural than that, rebuffed at Sparta, he should turn to
Sparta's rival? But Argos may well have regarded the risk as too
great, and not have gone beyond a promise to inquire of the oracle
whether it would be safe for their city to send help to Ionia. Cf.,

<p>Delphi now, as later (vii. 140 f.), may have thought the Great
King invincible, as did Aristagoras (v. 124) and the Samians
(vi. 13), and have foreshadowed, if it did not originate, the

historian's opinion that the authors of the revolt merely brought
evil on their country (v. 28, 97 n.). Probably, too, the proposed
confiscation of the treasures at Branchidae (v. 36), which the priests
at Branchidae and Delphi must have known was only too likely to
be carried out under the hard pressure of war, prejudiced Delphi
against Miletus.</p></div3>

(634) can hardly be right in attributing the sack of Branchidae and
the others, except that of Ephesus, to Xerxes in 479 B. C. Strabo's
account seems to depend on the story that the Branchidae themselves 
betrayed the temple and its treasures, a crime for which
their descendants in Sogdiana were said to have been punished by
Alexander (Strabo 518; Plut. Mor. 557 B; Q. Curtius, vii. 23).

Etruria were doubtless commercial. Sybaris was the d&eacute;p&ocirc;t to
<pb n="72"/>
which the wares of Asia and Egypt were brought by Milesian ships
(cf. <ref target="c.5.99" targOrder="U">v. 99 n.</ref>). Thence they were carried overland to Laus, and
there reshipped for Etruria. The control of this land-route was
all the more important, as foes of Miletus, Chalcis, and her allies
(v. 99 n.) commanded the Straits of Messina. The friendship of
the Etruscans with Sybaris is in marked contrast with their hostility
to other Greeks in the Tyrrhene seas (cf. i. 166). Further proof of
the importance of this overland route may be found in the alliance
coins (Pais, Ancient Italy, p. 83) of Siris and Pyxus (before 510 B. C.),
and later of New Sybaris and Posidonia (circ. 450), Croton and
Temesa, &amp;c. (Hill, G. and R. C., pp. 104, 115), and in the frequent
occurrence of Greek vases in Campanian and Etruscan tombs (Lenormant, 
La Grande Gr&egrave;ce, i. 263 f.). The colony of Thurii may
have been an attempt to revive this old trade, Athens here, as
elsewhere, figuring as the heir of Miletus (v. 97. 2 n.). Themistocles 
would seem to have originated the idea of a colony in that
district (viii. 62; <bibl n="Plut. Them. 32">Plut. Them. 32</bibl>), afterwards imperfectly realized

probably the first attempt to treat in tragedy an event of the day, an
attempt repeated by Phrynichus in his Phoenissae (476 B. C.), which,
like the Persae of Aeschylus, represented the defeat of Xerxes. His
earlier drama may have contained reproaches of Athens for the desertion 
of Miletus (<foreign lang="greek">οἰκήια κακά</foreign>), and have been intended to awaken
the national spirit and inspire resistance to Persia, perhaps by sea,
since Themistocles, choragus for Phrynichus in 476 B. C. (<bibl n="Plut. Them. 5">Plut.

<div id="c.6.40" type="chapter" n="40">
<p>A confused chapter, ambiguous in expression and difficult in substance. 
The central statement that Miltiades fled before a Scythian
raid and was restored by the Dolonci is clear enough. But of the
obscure sentences before and after two interpretations are given.</p>
<p>I. Rawlinson takes <foreign lang="greek">νεωστὶ ἐληλύθεε</foreign> of the first coming of Miltiades
to the Chersonese, the <foreign lang="greek">τῶν κατεχόντων πρηγμάτων</foreign> of the advance of
the Phoenician fleet, and the <foreign lang="greek">ἄλλα χαλεπώτερα</foreign> of the Scythian raid.
But to this the following objections seem fatal:</p>
<p>(1) It is absurd to apply <foreign lang="greek">νεωστί</foreign> to a period of at least fifteen years,
but the Scythic raid is clearly dated to 495 B. C., while Miltiades'
accession was before 510, probably before 515 B. C.</p>
<p>(2) The argument is weak. Rawlinson's explanation implies
that Miltiades' temporary expulsion by the Scyths was worse than
his permanent expulsion by the Persians, which is absurd.</p>
<p>(3) The clear intention of the author in the last sentence of the
chapter is to explain what precedes. Hence <foreign lang="greek">τρίτῳ ἔτεϊ</foreign> (&sect; 1) must
be identical with <foreign lang="greek">τρίτῳ ἔτεϊ πρότερον</foreign> (&sect; 2).</p>
<p>II. Therefore with Stein we must understand <foreign lang="greek">ἐληλύθεε</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">ἐλθόντα</foreign>
(&sect; 1) of Miltiades' return to the Chersonese (<foreign lang="greek">κατήγαγον</foreign>, &sect; 2), H.
<pb n="78"/>
awkwardly inserting the notice of his flight before the Scyths after
mentioning his return. H. means that the fortunes of Miltiades
went from bad to worse, his final expulsion by the Phoenicians
being a yet greater misfortune than his temporary flight before the
Scyths. Thus <foreign lang="greek">τρίτῳ ἔτεϊ τούτων</foreign> must mean the third year <foreign rend="ital">before</foreign> this
(cf. &sect; 2; Cobet, Abicht), or, if this translation be thought impossible,
<foreign lang="greek">πρό</foreign> must be inserted before <foreign lang="greek">τούτων</foreign> (Stein). Wells (Stud. Herod. pp.
118-20) gives another interpretation of this obscure passage (ch. 40).</p>

<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ἐρεθισθέντες ὑπὸ Δαρείου</lemma>. The idea of a war of vengeance on the
part of the Scyths seems a mere fiction (ch. 84), since the expedition
of Darius was at least fifteen, and probably twenty years before.
Perhaps the Scyths took advantage of the temporary weakening of
the Persian Empire by the Ionic revolt; more probably these
nomads were some Thracian or Moesian tribe and not Scyths.
Grote's suggestion (iv. 201) that it was the Persians and not the
Scyths who expelled Miltiades is not what H. says, and rests on
Miltiades' supposed treachery to Darius at the bridge over the
Danube (iv. 137). But this patriotic scheme is very doubtful; perhaps
it was invented when the tyrant of Chersonese had reached Athens
(ch. 104), and was anxious to prove himself a true friend of Hellenic
liberties (Thirlwall, ii, App. II; Macan, App. iii, &sect; 14; Klio ix. 413).</p></div3></div>

such treaties already existed, but the position of Histiaeus shows
that hitherto the local authorities in Ionia had been allowed much
independence. The organizing genius of Darius took advantage of
the revolt and its suppression to put an end to this. Thus the
Ionians were compelled by their Persian masters to accept a unity
which they had refused to impose on themselves at the suggestion
of Thales (i. 170). In the same way private wars were checked by
the Athenian <foreign lang="greek">ἀρχή</foreign> (<bibl n="Thuc. 1.115">Thuc. i. 115</bibl>). Evidence of long-continued
enmity may be found in the dispute between Samos and Priene
recorded in an Inscription in the Ashmolean Museum (Hicks<hi rend="sup">1</hi>, 152).</p></div3>
<div3 id="c.6.42.2" type="section" n="2">
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">φόρους</lemma>: cf. iii. 89, 90. The statement as to the tribute is defective
and difficult. Doubtless the arrangement of Artaphrenes applied
to other revolted tributaries as well as to Ionians, but H. mentions
only the most important, just as the whole rebellion is usually called
<pb n="79"/>
the Ionic revolt. Again, the words <foreign lang="greek">ἔτι καὶ ἐς ἐμέ</foreign> cannot bear the
natural meaning that tribute was still paid to Persia in accordance
with this assessment at the time when H. wrote his history, but
must be explained in one of the following ways:</p>
<p>(1) Grote (v. 194-5) thinks that the Persian king still maintained
his claim to the old tribute, though it was not really paid. The
satrap was still responsible to the king for the money, though
unable to exact it. As soon as the Athenian power seemed broken
in 412, the great king pressed Tissaphernes for payment (<bibl n="Thuc. 8.5">Thuc. viii.
5</bibl>). The claim had been for years in abeyance but never withdrawn. 
We may compare the grants of Myus and Lampsacus to
Themistocles (<bibl n="Thuc. 1.138">Thuc. i. 138</bibl>), and of Myrrhina and Gryneium to
Gongylus the Eretrian (<bibl n="Xen. Hell. 3.1.6">Xen. Hell. iii. 1. 6</bibl>). The latter were held
by Gongylus' descendants in 399 B. C., but all four cities were included
in the Athenian empire in its palmy days.</p>
<p>(2) Some suggest that the unlucky states on the Asiatic seaboard 
paid tribute both to Athens and to the Great King. Some
such arrangement seems certainly to have prevailed on the coast
of Thrace under the Odrysian kings (<bibl n="Thuc. 2.97">Thuc. ii. 97</bibl>), but the cases are
not really parallel.</p>
<p>(3) Another suggestion is that the assessment of Artaphrenes was
the basis of the Athenian <foreign lang="greek">φόρος</foreign>, which was certainly paid by these
cities before 450 B. C., and probably from 465. If, however, H.
meant that the Athenian <foreign lang="greek">τακταί</foreign> used the old valuation, he has
failed to express himself clearly, and the frequent alterations of
the Phoros on the existing quota lists seem inconsistent with this
explanation.</p>
<p>(4) The simplest explanation is that H. uses <foreign lang="greek">ἐς ἐμέ</foreign> loosely, meaning
merely till the Persian power was overthrown, i. e. between 479 and
circ. 465 B. C. Some of the states were still paying tribute when H.
was a boy; in all he could (and doubtless did) talk with those to
whom the claims of the Persian tax-collector were familiar. So
a septuagenarian Bengalee might well write to-day: &lsquo;The rule of
John Company lasted down to my time,&rsquo; although it really ended
in 1858.</p>
<p>It should further be noticed that Diodorus (x. 25. 2) ascribes not
only this regulation of taxes, but also the restoration of constitutional
government in Ionia (cf. ch. 43 n.) to Artaphrenes, acting on the
suggestion of Hecataeus. Was H. unwilling to allow credit to his
great predecessor for the conciliatory and successful reorganization
of Ionia?</p></div3></div>

<p>For the speech of Otanes cf. iii. 80, and for the &lsquo;Seven&rsquo; iii. 84.</p>
<p>It has been held that this is a reply to criticisms passed on the
story of the debate (iii. 80 f.), but the incredulity of the critics is
already noticed there, and may perhaps apply rather to the tradition
handed down to H. than to the form given it in his work. The
proof here alleged is of the weakest. Otanes, not Gobryas, was the
advocate of democracy, and there was all the difference between
establishing democracy in Persia and permitting it in Ionia. Further
H. seems to have exaggerated and misrepresented the action of
Mardonius. In many Greek and Carian cities (vii. 98, 195) dynasts
held their own. So in Chios Strattis (iv. 138; viii. 132), in Samos
Aeaces (ch. 25), in Cos Cadmus (vii. 164), in Halicarnassus
Artemisia (vii. 99). In Lampsacus, too, the sons of Aeantides, son
of Hippoclus (iv. 138) succeeded to the throne (<bibl n="Thuc. 6.59">Thuc. vi. 59</bibl>). Here
again, as in ch. 42, it is true that H. only speaks of Ionians, but
such a measure would naturally extend to all the revolted states
which had expelled their tyrants. This establishment of democracies
then may mean little more than the restoration of local liberties
ascribed by Diodorus to Artaphrenes (ch. 42 n.). In any case it
would seem to have been partial, and dictated rather by distrust of
the tyranny which had proved a dangerous instrument of government, 
than by any preference for democracy.</p></div3></div>

The two passages agree if in vii. 185 the Pieres are the branch of
the tribe who lived east of the Strymon (vii. 112). Scymnus Chius
(434) and Strabo (326) locate the Brygi far to the west on the

<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">αἰσχρῶς ἀγωνισάμενος</lemma>. Macan suggests that with the exception
of the loss to the fleet the expedition was a brilliant success, since
H. elsewhere (vii. 9. n. 2) allows Mardonius to claim credit for his
operations, and acknowledges his success in reconquering Thrace
and Macedon (vii. 108). But if the object of the campaign was the
<pb n="81"/>
conquest of Hellas in general and of Athens and Eretria in particular,
his task was unfulfilled. And in spite of modern scepticism there
is good reason to suppose that the idea of a punitive expedition and
wide schemes of conquest were entertamed at the Persian court.
The conquest of European Hellas may well have seemed the only
means of securing the dominion of Persia over the Greeks of Asia.
The expedition of Datis shows that Athens and Eretria were to be
punished, and also that the advance by land was considered to
have failed. Probably its difficulties had not been foreseen. When
this plan of campaign was again adopted, great preparations were
made to meet them (vii. 21 f.). No doubt Greek writers exaggerate
the failure of Mardonius, but his losses were real, and his recall is
best explained by Darius' adoption of a different plan of operations.</p></div3></div>

with notes on non-Hellenic customs</hi> (ch. 59, 60). This digression
(the main story is not resumed till ch. 61) is the most important
contribution in H. to Greek constitutional history. It illustrates
admirably how much and how little the Greeks knew of their origins,
and also the religious and military character of early kingship.
The legend of the twins is a clumsy fiction intended to account for
the dual kingship. The most probable origin of this anomaly is the
fusion of two distinct communities whose chiefs shared the throne.
That the two royal houses were of different origin seems proved by
the fact that their homes and tombs were to be found in different
quarters of Sparta, those of the Agiads close to the Acropolis (Paus.
<pb n="83"/>
iii. 14. 2), those of the Eurypontids on the heights of New Sparta
(<bibl n="Paus. 3.12.8">Paus. iii. 12. 8</bibl>). The two quarters may have been originally (cf.
the case of Rome) two distinct communities. It is perhaps most
likely that both communities and both kings were Dorian invaders
(Duncker, G. i. 351 f.), and that the claims of the kings to Achaean
descent (cf. v. 72; i. 67; vii. 159) were a fiction intended to justify
the Dorian conquest. Wachsmuth, however (Jahrbuch f. Philologie,
1868, p. 1 f.), sees in the superior dignity of the elder Agiad line, and
in the claim of Cleomenes to be an Achaean (v. 72), indications that
the old Achaean royal house survived side by side with that of the
invading Dorians. In any case, the rival theory that the dual kingship 
was instituted to weaken the royal power (cf. the Consulship at
Rome) confuses effect and cause, and fails to explain such facts as
the separate burying-places. For other instances of double kingship 
in Greece and elsewhere (e.g. Siam), and for further discussion

<p>The honours given the Spartan kings are divided into three
classes: (1) in war, ch. 56; (2) in peace, ch. 57; (3) after death,
ch. 58. H. (cf. 58. 1) perhaps regards them as resting on some such
contract between king and people as the monthly oath in Xen. Rep.
Lac. xv. 7. The eponymous hero Lacedaemon is (in <bibl n="Paus. 3.1.2">Paus. iii. 1.
2</bibl>, 20. 2), son of Zeus and Taygete, and husband of Sparta. His
shrine was at Alesiae between Therapne and Taygetus. With <foreign lang="greek">Ζεὺς
Λακεδαίμων</foreign> Stein compares <foreign lang="greek">Ζεὺς Ἀγαμέμνων, Ζ. Ἀμφιάραος, Ζ. Ἀμφικτύων, 
Ζ. Ἡρακλῆς, Ζ. Τροφώνιος</foreign>, but none of these is so definitely
local. <foreign lang="greek">Ζεὺς Λακεδαίμων</foreign> would seem to be a primitive local deity,
possibly chthonian, afterwards degraded into a &lsquo;hero&rsquo;. <foreign lang="greek">Ζεὺς
Οὐράνιος</foreign> is the lord of the heavens. The latter cult (<foreign lang="greek">τὰ μέγαλα
Οὐράνια</foreign>) continued under the Roman empire (C. I G. 1241, 1420).
The Spartan kings as Heracleids were descendants of Zeus, and his
natural representatives, as were the Heracleid kings of Macedon of
the Bottiaean Zeus, and the Aeacid princes in Epirus of the Dodonaean 
(Preller, i. 149). Xenophon (Rep. Lac. xiii and xv) tells us
the king offered all public sacrifices, and in particular, to Zeus
Agetor on setting forth to war, and to Zeus and Athena on crossing
the frontier.</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">πόλεμον ἐκφέρειν</lemma>. Perhaps in prehistoric times the kings could
actually declare war, but, even if this be so, the necessity of the
people's consent was early established (cf. App. XVII, &sect; 2).
Traces of the royal control of foreign affairs may be found even in
<pb n="85"/>
the fifth century (cf. v. 74, 75; vi. 73), but later this power was
vested in the Ephors (<bibl n="Xen. Hell. 3.1.1">Xen. Hell. iii. 1. 1</bibl>; v. 2. 9, 11); Xenophon
describes this state of things when he limits the power of the kings
to the conduct of the campaign. (Rep. Lac. ch. xv <foreign lang="greek">στρατίαν ὅποι ἂν ἡ
πόλις ἐκπέμπῃ ἡγεῖσθαι</foreign>, cf. ch. xiii.) Only when he had crossed the
frontier after favourable auspices (<foreign lang="greek">διαβατήρια</foreign>) did the king exercise
a really sovran power (<bibl n="Thuc. 5.60">Thuc. v. 60</bibl>, 66; viii. 5, and in general App.
XVII, &sect; 2). Even in the field insubordination was not unknown
(ix. 55; <bibl n="Thuc. 5.72">Thuc. v. 72</bibl>).</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ἐν τῷ ἄγεϊ</lemma>. Probably such an execration entailed exile (cf. <bibl n="Thuc. 5.72">Thuc.

<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">νεομηνίας</lemma>. The first day of the month (&lsquo;new moon&rsquo;) was everywhere 
sacred, and a day of offering to the gods (<foreign lang="greek">ἱερὰ ἐπιμήνια, ἔμμηνα</foreign>:
cf. viii. 41. 2); the seventh was the birthday of Apollo and specially
dedicated to him (Hesiod, <foreign lang="greek">Ἔργα</foreign> 770). For the accusative cf. i. 181.

<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">μέδιμνον</lemma>. The old view that the Laconian or Aeginetan medimnus

disproved by Ath. Pol. ch. 10 (Sandys, note; cf. G. F. Hill, Num.
Chron. 1897, p. 284 f.). Probably the Pheidonian measures are
equivalent to the Babylonian, and stood to the Solonian in the
ratio of 12 : 13. Since the Attic medimnus contains nearly twelve
gallons, the Pheidonian would be nearly eleven gallons.</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">τετάρτη</lemma> cannot be the Attic <foreign lang="greek">τέταρτον</foreign>, which, being the quarter of
the sextarius (<foreign lang="greek">ξέστη</foreign>), belongs to Roman times and is far too small,
being about a quarter of a pint. Since the monthly contribution of
each Spartan to the Syssitia was a medimnus of meal and eight
<foreign lang="greek">χόες</foreign> of wine (<bibl n="Plut. Lyc. 12">Plut. Lyc. 12</bibl>), this Laconian <foreign lang="greek">τετάρτη</foreign> may be one of eight
<pb n="86"/>
<foreign lang="greek">χόες</foreign>, or about five and a half gallons; if, however, the proportion
given in &sect; 3 of one cotyle to two choenices be taken, it would be but
two <foreign lang="greek">χόες</foreign>.</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">προεδρίας</lemma>: concrete; cf. iv. 88. 1. For the abstract sense cf.
i. 54. 2; ix. 73. 3. This custom is illustrated by the anecdote in
ch. 67.</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">προξείνους</lemma>. Proxeni are usually citizens of a foreign city who
undertook to watch over the interests of the community which they
represented, e. g. Callias was Proxenus of Sparta at Athens (cf. viii.
136. 1; <bibl n="Xen. Hell. 6.3.4">Xen. Hell. vi. 3. 4</bibl>). The Proxenia in these cases seems to
have been almost hereditary in character (<bibl n="Thuc. 5.43">Thuc. v. 43</bibl>; vi. 89). It
does not appear probable that the kings had the appointment either
of these Spartan Proxeni abroad or of the representatives of foreign
states in Sparta. Hence P. Monceaux has suggested that these
proxeni nominated by the kings were special ones appointed to do the
honours of the state to foreigners who had no ordinary representative
at Sparta; for some late analogies cf. Smith, Antiquities, i. 978.</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">Πύθιοι</lemma>. The connexion of Sparta with Delphi was peculiarly
close. Cic. de Divin. i. 95 &lsquo;(Lacedaemonii) de rebus maioribus

<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">πατρούχου</lemma>. An only daughter was styled <foreign lang="greek">ἐπίκληρος</foreign> (or in Doric
<foreign lang="greek">ἐπιπαματίς</foreign> or <foreign lang="greek">παμῶχος</foreign>), which means not that she is the heiress,
but that she passes with the inheritance. Aristotle (Pol. ii. 6.
11, 1270 a 26 f.) distinctly tells us that if a father died intestate
leaving only a daughter, the heir, as guardian of the orphan daughter,
chose her a husband, and that even the father had but recently
acquired the right to dispose of his daughter's hand as he pleased.
In the days of H. the kings dealt with the question, as did the
Archon Eponymus at Athens. In so doing they clearly acted as
judges merely determining to whom the <foreign lang="greek">ἐπίκληρος</foreign> belonged by law.
All this is explained by the primitive constitution of the GraecoRoman 
family. The inheritance, along with the household cults, and
<foreign rend="ital">patria potestas</foreign>, always passed to males. If, then, there were no sons
but only a daughter, the ancient principle debarred her from heirship,
but by custom she passed with the inheritance to the nearest male
relative, whom she married (so Gorgo Leonidas, vii. 205; cf. also
vi. 71; Plut. Agis 11). Apparently a father, if he gave an only
<pb n="87"/>
daughter in marriage, must give her to the nearest relative,
or to an adopted son. But adoption (&sect; 5) itself took place
before the kings, and must have been subject to legal rules. If
the father died without betrothing his daughter, the nearest male
relative could claim both the inheritance and the hand of the
daughter. If there were several claimants the kings decided
between them. The same principles held good in Crete (cf. the
Gortyna Code) and at Athens. Cf. Fustel de Coulanges, Nouvelles
Recherches, pp. 97 f.</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ὁδῶν δημοσιέων</lemma>. According to Stein and Gilbert, this refers only
to the delimitation of roads and private estates, but the kings as

<div3 id="c.6.57.5" type="section" n="5">
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">παρίζειν</lemma>. The words imply that the kings were not <foreign rend="ital">ex-officio</foreign>
presidents. Doubtless the Ephors both convened (<bibl n="Xen. Hell. 3.3.8">Xen. Hell. iii.
3. 8</bibl>) and presided over the Gerousia. Cf. App. XVII, &sect; 2.</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">δύο ψήφους τιθεμένους</lemma>. There can be little doubt Thucydides
refers to this passage (i. 20. 3) when he gives as an instance of
popular errors the belief that each of the Spartan kings had two
votes, not one only, since he corrects in the same sentence another
supposed error in H. (ix. 53), <foreign lang="greek">πολλὰ δὲ καὶ ἄλλα ἔτι καὶ νῦν ὄντα καὶ οὐ
χρόνῳ ἀμνηστούμενα καὶ οἱ ἄλλοι Ἕλληνες οὐκ ὀρθῶς οἴονται, ὥσπερ τούς
τε Λακεδαιμονίων βασιλέας μὴ μιᾷ ψήφῳ προστίθεσθαι ἑκάτερον ἀλλὰ
δυοῖν, καὶ τὸν Πιτανάτην λόχον αὐτοῖς εἶναι ὃς οὐδ’ ἐγένετο πώποτε</foreign>. But
H., though the expression is obscure, probably means not that each
king had two votes, but that two votes were given for the <foreign rend="ital">two</foreign>
absent kings, and that the vote of the relative who acted as proxy
for both was the third. He, however, overlooks the fact that the same
person could not be the nearest relative of both kings, since the two
houses were only related by a fictitious genealogy and never intermarried. 
Really there must have been two proxies, one for each
king. H. Richards (Cl. R. xix. 343) would omit <foreign lang="greek">τρίτην δὲ τὴν ἑωυτῶν</foreign>
as a late insertion, and so get clearly the sense that the nearest
relative of each king gave two votes, his own and that of the king
his kinsman.</p></div3></div>

<p>Therapne stood on some precipitous heights nearly two miles
south-east of Sparta on the opposite side of the Eurotas. The view
that it was the site of Homeric (Achaean) Sparta, suggested by
its commanding position, is confirmed by the discovery there of
Mycenaean pottery and by the worship of Helen and Menelaus
(Isoc. x. 63). This sanctuary of Helen is probably identical with
the temple of Menelaus, where Menelaus and Helen were buried
(<bibl n="Paus. 3.19.9">Paus. iii. 19. 9</bibl>). Its ruins, and near them some Mycenaean
remains, have been discovered on the top of the hill called Menelaium
<pb n="89"/>
(Polyb. v. 18. 21; Liv. xxxiv. 28). Castor and Pollux, Helen's
brothers, were supposed to lie buried in Therapne on alternate days
(Pind. Nem. x. 55; Pyth. xi. 62; cf. Frazer on <bibl n="Paus. 3.19.9">Paus. iii. 19. 9</bibl>).
The Phoebaeum was below Therapne in the plain on the western
bank of the Eurotas (<bibl n="Paus. 3.14.9">Paus. iii. 14. 9</bibl>).</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">Ἑλένης</lemma>. The view that Helen was a goddess of beauty, and the
identification of her with <foreign lang="greek">ξείνη Ἀφροδίτη</foreign> (ii. 112), seem to be H.'s
own conjectures, and erroneous. The foreign Aphrodite must be
Astarte, while Helen was a native heroine more akin to Artemis
(Wide, Lakonische Kulte, 340 f.), perhaps originally a tree nymph.
The Rhodians worshipped Helen of the tree (<bibl n="Paus. 3.19.9">Paus. iii. 19. 9</bibl>, with
Frazer), and the Spartans Helen's plane-tree (Theocr. xviii. 43).
The whole story reads like the miracle of a mediaeval saint, and
illustrates a side of Greek life which hardly appears in our literary
sources.</p></div3></div>

punished (ix. 86 f.), and as it was proposed to punish other traitors

the Spartan policy of turning the Amphictyonic league into a weapon
against Medism, and fixes the expedition with Duncker in 476 B. C.,
explaining the erroneous dating of the reign of Archidamus in
Diodorus (xii. 35) 476-434 B. C., as due to a confusion between
the banishment of Leotychides 476 B. C. and his death 469 B. C.
E. Meyer, however (F. ii. 504-9), argues that the crown passed
to Archidamus, not at the death, but on the exile of Leotychides

the exile of Leotychides must be placed in 469-468 and the expedition 
shortly before, as soon as Sparta had put down opposition
in the Peloponnese. In view, however, of the case of Agesipolis,
whose twenty years in exile are reckoned in his reign (Diod. xiii. 75),
Busolt's solution is preferable. (For another suggestion cf. Grote

Panofsky in holding that these variant accounts do not represent
genuine local traditions, but are conjectures due to the historian.
Clearly, however, there was a general belief that Cleomenes came to
a bad end, while each people would naturally select the impiety
which injured itself as the ground of heaven's vengeance. Again,
H. distinguishes his own opinion (ch. 84) from these more widely
accepted views. Some critics, quite needlessly, see in the story of
Cleomenes' awful death a Spartan fiction devised to hide the fact
that he was put out of the way as a danger to the state.</p></div3></div>

of rock runs down sheer into the water, and at the foot of this there
is an arched cavern through which the lake is discharged (Tozer,
G. p. 112). The view that the water which here enters the cavern
reappears as the Erasinus near Argos is still held by the natives of

miles) is much greater than the length of any of the other subterraneous

<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ἐπίκοινα</lemma>: adverbial (i. 216. 1). For the Milesian half of the response 
cf. ch. 19n. The oracle is obscure enough to be regarded
as a genuine Pythian response. It is not easy to see how it could
raise a suspicion of trickery, unless it be assumed that the victory of
the female over the male implies a success won by craft over force.
But at least three interpretations are possible:</p>
<p>1. Hera of Argos shall defeat and drive out him of Lacedaemon
(Cleomenes or Apollo), but it will be a Cadmeian victory, bringing
mourning and ruin on Argos. But unless the first lines be applied
to the expulsion of Cleomenes by Hera (ch. 82), they promise Argos
a victory not recorded by H.</p>
<p>2. Sparta (female) shall conquer Argos (a male hero), so the
women of Argos shall make lamentation, and men in time to come
count that day the ruin of Argos. In this case, however, <foreign lang="greek">ἐξελάσῃ</foreign>
remains unexplained.</p>
<p>3. Later authors (Pausanias, ii. 20. 8; Plutarch, Moralia, p. 245
D, E, quoting Socrates of Argos, F. H. G. iv. 497) tell us how
Telesilla, the poetess, armed the women, the infirm, and the slaves,
and drove back Cleomenes from the defenceless town after his victory
in the field. This tradition, which fits the oracle admirably, is
clearly of local Argive origin, whereas H. gives us the official
Spartan version, which presents obvious difficulties (cf. ch. 82 n.).
But the story of Telesilla appears to be late and is most probably
unhistorical, since it seems designed to explain the oracle, and the
<pb n="95"/>
festival of Wantonness (<foreign lang="greek">τὰ Ὑβριστικά</foreign>) at Argos. At this feast the
women dressed as men and the men as women, even wearing veils
(Plutarch, <foreign rend="ital">l. c.</foreign>; Polyaenus, viiii. 33). Such exchange of garments is
a widely spread religious custom, particularly at the time of marriage;
thus Argive brides wore beards (Plutarch, <foreign rend="ital">l. c.</foreign>) and Spartan brides
men's clothes on their wedding nights (<bibl n="Plut. Lyc. 15">Plut. Lyc. 15</bibl>). So too
there was in Cyprus a sacrifice to a bearded Aphrodite, at which
men were dressed as women and women as men (Macrob. Sat. iii.
8; Servius on Aen. ii. 632); for other parallels see Frazer, <bibl n="Paus. 3.197">Paus.
iii. 197</bibl>; Farnell, ii. 634-5, 748 n. 104. Again, Lucian (Amores 30)
says that in consequence of Telesilla's victory the war-god (Ares)
was deemed at Argos a god of women, and Plutarch adds (<foreign rend="ital">l. c.</foreign>) that
the victorious women built a temple to the war-god (Enyalius), but
in view of Pausanias' statement that the statue of Telesilla stood in
front of the temple of Aphrodite, it seems likely that the supposed
war-god is really an armed Aphrodite, a goddess of Eastern origin
(cf. <ref target="c.1.105" targOrder="U">i. 105 n.</ref>; Frazer, iii. 338; Farnell, ii. 653-4). The story of Telesilla
then seems to be an aetiological myth, founded on a misunderstood
rite and a misinterpreted oracle. Wells (<foreign rend="ital">op. cit.</foreign> pp. 91-4) defends
the historical character of the tale of Telesilla.</p>

though the proper crest of Argos is the wolf or wolf's head (Busolt,

of snakes, was in danger, and the other, the driving forth of the male

sacrilege, is a glaring inconsistency. It is most unlikely that
Cleomenes after a great victory would allow himself to be robbed
of its fruits by any such scruple. More probable explanations of
his failure to attack the town are (1) the bribery alleged (ch. 82, cf.
72 n.); or (2) reluctance to face great loss of life in storming the
wall, and consciousness of the Spartans lack of skill in siege operations 
(ix. 70; <bibl n="Thuc. 1.102">Thuc. i. 102</bibl>; cf. Busolt, Lakedaimonier, i. 335); or

Aristotle means by &lsquo;Perioeci&rsquo; serfs. If so, H. is justified in calling

<p>Though Argos was professedly neutral in the Persian war, Tiryns

Tiryns is only conceivable if Argos was engaged elsewhere. Now
about 472 Argos was allied to Tegea against the Spartans (cf. <ref target="c.9.35" targOrder="U">ix. 35 n.</ref>),
by whom the allies were defeated near Tegea, but in the next great
battle, fought by the Arcadians against the Spartans at Dipaea (circ.
470), the Argives took no part. The suggestion seems probable
that Tiryns was encouraged to attack Argos by the battle of Tegea,
and that the Argives were absent from the field of Dipaea because
they were fully occupied in the siege of Tiryns, which was obstinately 
defended (Busolt, iii. 121 f.). Possibly Mycenae too fell at this
time (468 B. C.). More probably, however, it was while Sparta was
occupied with the Helot revolt after 464 B. C. (Diod. xi. 65); cf.
Busolt, iii. 244; Meyer, iii, &sect; 325. Neither city was left so completely 
desolate as Strabo (372) implies, as is proved by remains

<p>The number of the Athenian ships, fifty, making with twenty
Corinthian vessels the total seventy, may be an inference from the
fifty naucraries of the Cleisthenic constitution (Cleidemus, fr. 8,
F. H. G. i. 360). In ch. 132 the Athenian fleet sent to Paros is
seventy sail, as is the Aeginetan in ch. 92. 1; but these numbers
may rest on the total given here, the Aeginetan fleet being presumed 
to be equal in number to the enemy; and even if the number
of Miltiades' fleet be correct, we may suppose that it included as
transports ships unfit for action, or, again, that the Athenian navy had
been allowed to decay between 489 and 486 B. C. Macan indeed argues
that though the principal war is subsequent to Marathon, the
Corinthian loan of ships must be placed earlier (possibly during the
Ionic revolt, 498 B. C.), because &lsquo;(1) Miltiades took seventy ships to
Paros, (2) it is scarcely credible the Corinthian gift to Athens was
after Marathon&rsquo;. But the loan of ships can hardly be separated
from the great war which he rightly places circ. 486 (cf. <foreign rend="ital">inf.</foreign> ch. 93 n.),
and Corinth would still prefer Athens to Aegina till Themistocles
made the navy of Athens superior; so it is easier to suppose an error
in the number of Miltiades' fleet than to dislocate the whole narrative 
of Herodotus.</p></div>

<p>The story breaks off short. Apparently the Athenians are successful
both on sea (92. 1; <bibl n="Thuc. 1.41">Thuc. i. 41</bibl>) and land (92. 3); yet we find their fleet
in disorder (93), and defeated with the loss of four ships. No
doubt the Argive corps suffered severely in the land-fight, but only
a success of the Aeginetans on land can account for a second seabattle, 
and the disorder and final retreat of the Athenians. Hence
it has been proposed to transfer to this war the events given by H.
as the Argive and Aeginetan version of the earlier war (v. 86, 87 n.;
Busolt, ii. 648). That Aegina had the better in the war is proved
by the increase of the Athenian navy, which was justified by the
exigencies of this war.</p>
<p>The date of this war has been much discussed. H. placed its
outbreak before Marathon, as is shown by its position in his
narrative and by the pluperfect in ch. 94: <foreign lang="greek">Ἀθηναίοισι μὲν δὴ
πόλεμος συνῆπτο πρὸς Αἰγινήτας, ὁ δὲ Πέρσης τὸ ἑωυτοῦ ἐποίεε</foreign>. But
the reasons for preferring a later date (circ. 488-486) are very
strong.</p>
<p>1. The accession of Leotychides, since it follows the arrival of the
heralds of Darius, must be placed late in 491 B. C. There is not
time before Marathon (490 B. C.) for the discovery of the corruption
of the Pythia, the exile of Cleomenes, his restoration and his death
<pb n="102"/>
(85. 1). Yet his death preceded the demand for the return of the
hostages, which led to this war.</p>
<p>2. The Aeginetan war is always treated as the ground or pretext
for the creation of a great Athenian navy by Themistocles (vii. 144;
<bibl n="Thuc. 1.14">Thuc. i. 14</bibl>), dated by <bibl n="Aristot. Ath. Pol. 22">Ath. Pol. 22</bibl> to 483 B. C., and clearly immediately 
preceded the invasion of Xerxes, since in 480 the feud
between Athens and Aegina is still the bitterest among patriotic
Greeks (vii. 145). The connexion of the Aeginetan war with the
Attic navy dates it to the years preceding Salamis. Did the war
belong to 491-490 B. C. we might well ask what were the Aeginetans
about when Datis and Artaphrenes sacked Eretria and threatened
Athens.</p>
<p>3. The oracle (v. 89) bidding the Athenians wait thirty years for
their revenge would seem to be a <foreign rend="ital">vaticinium post eventum</foreign> dating
from 458 B. C., when Aegina was reduced. If so, it would refer to
the greatest war between Athens and Aegina and would date it about
488 B. C. (cf. <ref target="c.5.89" targOrder="U">v. 89 n.</ref>).</p>
<p>4. If the Argive war of Cleomenes be correctly placed, circ.
495 B. C. (cf. App. XVII. 3), it would be barely possible that Argos
should send a thousand volunteers as early as 490 B. C., though
she might have sufficiently recovered to do so four years later.
On the whole question cf. Macan, App. VIII, &sect;&sect; 5, 6; Busolt, ii.
644 f.</p>
<p>5. The dispatch of the whole navy (cf. 89 n.) to Paros in 489 B. C.
is irreconcilable with a still undecided struggle with Aegina.</p></div>

μέμνηνται· ἐλέγετο δὲ καὶ ἐδόκει ἐπὶ τοῖς μέλλουσι γενήσεσθαι σημῆναι</foreign>.
It can hardly be doubted that Delian tradition, as H. says, recognized 
only one earthquake, and that Thucydides is deliberately
correcting the date given by his predecessor. Nor can H., when
he visited Delos (cf. <foreign lang="greek">ὡς ἔλεγον Δήλιοι, μέχρι ἐμεῦ</foreign>), or when he wrote
the passage, as it would seem (c. 92) after the beginning of the
Peloponnesian War, have heard of more than one earthquake.
Hence it is unlikely that the historians refer to two separate earthquakes. 
It is, however, probable that both misdated the earthquake. 
H. must be taken to mean soon after the departure of
Datis, i. e. 490 B. C., or at least before the invasion of Xerxes in
480 B. C. Thucydides, although a little later (ii. 16) he says <foreign lang="greek">ἄλλως
τε καὶ ἄρτι ἀνειληφότες τὰς κατασκευὰς μετὰ τὰ Μηδικά</foreign>, can hardly have
intended any date before 445 by the phrase <foreign lang="greek">ὀλίγον πρὸ τούτων</foreign>.
Possibly the earthquake really occurred some time before H.'s
visit, circ. 460 B. C., and was connected by credulous piety either
with the Persian or the Peloponnesian war, and its date altered
accordingly. But certainty is unattainable.</p>
<p>According to Pindar (fr. 58 (65), ap. Strabo 485), Delos was
borne about by winds and waves till Leto gave birth to her children
there; afterwards it was firmly fixed, supported on four iron columns.</p></div3>

<p>Darius reigned 522-486 B. C., Xerxes 486-465 B. C., Artaxerxes

reign was over, nor does H. elsewhere refer clearly to an event so
late. Cf. Introd. &sect; 9. Yet the identification of these three reigns
with three generations&mdash;that is, one hundred years (ii. 142. 2)&mdash;
implies that the passage was written nearly a century after the
accession of Darius; and though the war between the leaders of
Greece might be the battle of Tanagra, and other hostilities before
445 B. C., the phrase has far more point if written in the early years
of the Peloponnesian war. Twenty generations = 666 2/3 years (ii.

the Trojan war circ. 1260 B. C. (ii. 145 <foreign rend="ital">ad fin.</foreign>), and the Dorian

<p>Clearly H. is anxious to justify the Athenian people for not
sending succour from Attica, and the Athenian cleruchs for leaving
Eretria to its fate, by emphasizing the divided counsels and positive
treachery of the Eretrians. After Marathon it may well have been
thought that a bold stand might have been made at Eretria. At
the time so heroic a counsel could only be justified if the Eretrians,
like the Athenians, were willing to meet the Persians in the open
field. It is <hi rend="bold">likely</hi> enough that in Eretria, which had favoured
Pisistratus (i. 62), the Medizing party was strong, but H. implies
that there was but one true man, Aeschines, in a rotten State.

Eretrian who Medized, Gongylus; and his treachery seems to have

means as favourable to the Persians as it appeared. It is divided
into two halves by a mountain torrent (Charadra) which rushes
down from Mount Pentelicus. And the apparent length of the plain
is deceptive, for at either extremity there is a marsh. That on the

<p>It is most improbable that Athens had no understanding with
Sparta before the mission of Philippides. Indeed, his hasty dispatch
by the generals seems an appeal to an existing ally to fulfil her obligations. 
But if, as Busolt (ii. 580) suggests, Sparta had concluded
only an <foreign lang="greek">ἐπιμαχία</foreign> with Athens, the <foreign rend="ital">casus foederis</foreign> would only arise
when the Persians directly attacked Attica (<bibl n="Thuc. 1.44">Thuc. i. 44</bibl>; v. 47, 48,

Athenian name (C. I. A.), whereas Pheidippides is a witticism of
Aristophanes (Nub. 67), which he would hardly have dared to make

<p>Mount Parthenion divides the little plain of Hysiae from that of

<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">Πανὸς ἱρόν</lemma>. The grottos of Pan and of Apollo have been excavated 
by M. Cavvadias (1897). There are two caves with narrow
entrances, partly blocked by natural pillars of rock, so that they
offer complete seclusion, though but narrow space within. These
would be suitable for the secret meetings of Apollo and Creusa (Ion
10 f., 492 f., 936 f.), which Pausanias (i. 28. 4) places in the cave of
Apollo, but Euripides in that of Pan, as does Aristophanes that of
Cinesias and Myrrhina (Lys. 911 f.). Subsequently the worship of
Apollo seems to have been transferred to the more open cave where
votive tablets were found (Gardner, Athens, p. 93 f.; for a full discussion 
with plan cf. D'Ooge, Acropolis, pp. 6-9), the more secret
caves being now the shrine of Pan. In the grotto was a statue of Pan
(Anthol. Plan. 232; cf. 259) with an inscription ascribed to Simonides,

was discovered in a garden at the foot of the Acropolis, but it
appears to have decorated a column or balustrade like the similar
statue found in Peiraeus (Michaelis, Ancient Marbles in Great
Britain, p. 248). The representations of the cave of Pan on Attic
coins of Antonine date, giving views of the Acropolis, appear to be
too inaccurate to be of service (J. H. S. viii, pp. 24-5). His worship
may have been established or revived by Cimon (<foreign lang="greek">καταστάντων σφι εὖ

and in the second rests on a confusion between the actual day of the
battle and that of the yearly festival at which, in fulfilment of a vow
of the Polemarch, five hundred goats were sacrificed to Artemis
Agrotera (cf. Boeckh, Kl. Schr. iv. 85 f., vi. 329 f.). The most probable 
date is Metageitnion 17 = Sept. 12, i. e. the full moon of the
month Metageitnion which preceded the festival. The speed of
the Spartan march seems to show that their desire to help Athens
was genuine, and that the battle took place on the first day it was

<p>The ancient Marathon must be placed not at the modern Marathona,

remains, but, with most topographers from Leake (Top. of Athens,
ii. 89-92) to Milch&ouml;fer (Karten von Attika, text, iii, p. 52), at or near
Vrana, a commanding site with abundant ancient remains. The
camp of the Athenians was probably not at the <foreign lang="greek">Μάνδρα τῆς Γραίας</foreign>
(Lolling, M. A. I. i, p. 67 f.), since that enclosure seems to be the
work of Herodes Atticus in later days and not the precinct of
Heracles. Again, if the Athenian camp was in the side valley of
Avlona the Persians would be hidden from the Athenians by the
intervening ridge of Kotroni; this position too might be threatened
in rear by a Persian advance up the Charadra past Oenoe, and would
not have guarded the coast road to Athens by Pallene. Further
this site, like that under Mount Agrieliki, preferred by Leake and
Milch&ouml;fer (<foreign rend="ital">l. c.</foreign>), is waterless. Hence the most suitable position for
the Heracleum and the Athenian camp seems to be the convent of
St. George on the spur of Mount Aphorismos above Vrana. This

the Christian champion having naturally replaced the heathen hero.

Such an arrangement existed in Alexander's army
(Arrian, i. 14. 6, 28. 3, &amp;c.). In that case, however, the tribe of

followed on inscriptions of the time of the Peloponnesian war

attested by Pausanias (i. 32. 3) for the monument at Marathon, and
is confirmed by the stele of the tribe Erechtheis (459-458 B. C., Hicks
26), this would seem to be the natural meaning here. It is, however,
inconsistent with the traditions in Plutarch (Aristid. 5) that the
tribes Antiochis and Leontis stood together in the centre, and (Mor.
628 D) that the Aeantis stood on the right of the line. The latter
point is confirmed by a reference to an elegy of Aeschylus, and
might be explained by the fact that the Polemarch belonged to the
tribe Aeantis, only in that case H. would naturally have written <foreign lang="greek">αἱ
ἄλλαι φυλαί</foreign>. Plutarch implies (Mor. 628 D) that the Aeantis was
<foreign lang="greek">πρυτανεύουσα φυλή</foreign> at the time of Marathon. It is likely enough that
the order of the tribes in battle was determined by lot, as was that
of the Prytanies (<bibl n="Aristot. Ath. Pol. 43">Ath. Pol. 43. 2</bibl>), but improbable that the two were

after a mile's run in full armour would be beyond the power of any
large body of soldiers, however well trained. The &lsquo;mile&rsquo;, however,
is probably an inference from the distance between the Athenian
position near Vrana and the place where they charged the Persians
near the Soros. No doubt the advance was rapid, but only for the last
200 yards, when within bowshot, would the Attic hoplites charge at

these knights were, at least till 478 B. C., equipped not as true cavalry
but as mounted infantry. Hence Athens depended on Thessalian
horse in 510 B. C. (v. 63), and in 490 B. C. had certainly no cavalry
fit to meet the Persian (cf. also ix. 40, 68, 69). At Salamis (<bibl n="Plut. Them. 14">Plut.

an army could march after a pitched battle, nor could the Athenians
leave Marathon before they were certain of the intentions of the
enemy. But the voyage round Sunium (seventy miles) would take
longer. Hence both march and voyage, placed by Plutarch (Arist.
5) on the same day as the battle, should probably be assigned to the
following day. If the Athenians really by a heroic effort marched
back on the actual day of battle, it must have been to meet a detachment 
carried by a flying squadron which set sail before the
battle (J. H. S. xxxi. 104, and App. XVIII, &sect;&sect; 8, 9).</p>

<p>The number of the slain (as of captured ships, ch. 115) is probably 
trustworthy. The names of the Athenians would be recorded
on the stelae which once adorned the great mound (Soros) over the
tomb of the fallen heroes (<bibl n="Paus. 1.32.3">Paus. i. 32. 3</bibl>). That the Soros is the
grave of the victors has been proved by recent excavations (Frazer,
ii. 433-4). The barbarian dead may well have been counted on the
field. The moderation of the estimate contrasts most favourably
with later exaggerations&mdash;the 200,000 of the inscription in the Stoa
Poikile (Suidas), 300,000 of Pausanias (iv. 25. 5), or the innumerable
multitude of Xenophon (Anab. iii. 2. 12) and Plutarch (de Malign.
26; 862 B). It is noticeable that H. gives no figures for the total
number engaged on either side. Both Justin (ii. 9) and Nepos
(<bibl n="Nep. Milt. 5">Milt. 5</bibl>) give 1,000 Plataeans, a good round exaggeration (ix. 28. 6 n.);
but the former puts the Athenians at 10,000, the latter at 9,000
(cf. <bibl n="Paus. 4.25.5">Paus. iv. 25. 5</bibl>; x. 20. 2). These numbers are probably derived
from Ephorus, and rest on a calculation of 1,000 men to a tribe.
Yet they may well be near the truth, allowing for the total omission
of light-armed troops. On the other hand, even the lowest ancient
estimate of the Persians&mdash;200,000 foot (of whom only 100,000 fought
in the battle) and 10,000 horse (<bibl n="Nep. Milt. 4">Nep. Milt. 4, 5</bibl>)&mdash;is greatly
exaggerated, not to speak of the 500,000 of Plato (Menex. 240 A)
and Lysias (Epitaph. 21), or the 600,000 of Justin (ii. 9). Modern
estimates rest on conjecture or on the number of the Persian ships
(vi. 95 n.), an insecure foundation. Duncker's 60,000 is an outside
estimate; perhaps 40,000 would be nearer the mark.</p>

aid on the side of the Persians, not of the Greeks. Cf. also App.

<p>H. again insists on the eminence of the Alcmaeonids (cf. <ref target="c.5.62.2" targOrder="U">v. 62.

Cylonian massacre (? 632 B. C.) (cf. <ref target="c.5.71" targOrder="U">v. 71 n.</ref>). That Alcmaeon was
the founder of the family's great wealth is suggested by the name
Alcmaeonid, and by the story here given, which is obviously a comic
version of the enrichment of the family by the Lydian king or by
successful trade with Sardis (Meyer, i,<hi rend="sup">1</hi> &sect; 488). As is usual in such
stories (cf. i. 29. 1; vi. 127. 3 n.), the chronology is confused and
erroneous. Croesus reigned in Lydia circ. 560-546 B. C. (or five
years later, Busolt, ii. 458-60), and his embassy to Delphi is not
likely to have been earlier than 556-555 (Marmor Parium); but
Alcmaeon appears to have been general in the Sacred war with
Cirrha (circ. 595-586 B. C., <bibl n="Plut. Sol. 11">Plut. Sol. 11</bibl>), and circ. 550 B. C. has a
grand-daughter old enough to be married to Pisistratus. The
marriage of Megacles and Agariste (<foreign rend="ital">inf.</foreign>) must therefore be placed
before 565, probably 572 B. C. (cf. 126. 2), and the connexion of
Alcmaeon with the Lydian king a generation earlier (<foreign rend="ital">inf.</foreign>). It is,

to the embassy sent to Delphi by Alyattes (i. 19. 25), and ascribe

<p>Lehmann supposes H. confused two Pheidons (Hermes, xxxv.

<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">Φείδωνος</lemma>. The date here assigned to Pheidon, viz. the age of
Cleisthenes (circ. 600-570), though accepted by Beloch (i. 282;
Rh. Mus. xlv. 595) and Trieber, and supported by the statement
that he expelled the Elean Agonothetae, apparently after 572 B. C.
(cf. Busolt, i. 604 and 612), can hardly be maintained. If, indeed,
Pheidon first coined money (Ephorus in Strabo 358, Marm. Par.)
in Greece proper, he would belong to the seventh century according
<pb n="118"/>
to the numismatists, but the statement is an unhistorical amplification 
of H. (<foreign lang="greek">τὰ μέτρα</foreign>) and inconsistent with the dates explicitly or
implicitly assigned to Pheidon by Ephorus and the Parian marble.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Ephorus making Pheidon the tenth descendant
of Temenus (Strab. <foreign rend="ital">l. c.</foreign>; cf. <bibl n="Paus. 2.19.2">Paus. ii. 19. 2</bibl>) would appear to place
him circ. 800-770 B. C. (Busolt, i. 613), or a generation later (Abbott,
Exc. vi to Bk. VI). The yet earlier dates for Pheidon seem due
to his connexion with the royal line of Macedon. Caranus, the
founder of the dynasty (unknown till the fourth century), is declared
to be brother of Pheidon, and seventh in descent from Temenus
(Theopomp. Fr. 30, F. H. G. i. 283), and eleventh from Heracles.
This made the Macedonian dynasty older than the Median, then
believed to have succeeded the Assyrian in 884 (Ctesias), and placed
Pheidon in the same generation as Lycurgus, circ. 900-870 (Marm.
Par. 894 B. C.). Finally, when Lycurgus, on account of the disk of
Iphitus, was brought down to the first Olympiad (776 B. C.), Caranus
and Pheidon too were moved down. Pheidon's accession was fixed
in 798 (Jerome; cf. Eusebius and Syncellus), and his Olympiad (the
8th) fifty years later, as the crown and consummation of a long and
prosperous reign (748 B. C.) (<bibl n="Paus. 6.22.2">Paus. vi. 22. 2</bibl>). This date is accepted
by Grote (ii. 315), Duncker (ii. 67), Holm (i. 215), and Abbott (<foreign rend="ital">l. c.</foreign>).</p>
<p>Pausanias, however, makes Pheidon celebrate the Olympia
in conjunction with the men of Pisa. Now Strabo (355) distinctly 
places the presidency of the Pisatans after the 26th
Olympiad, though quite aware of Ephorus' views on Pheidon
(p. 358). Africanus also knows no break in the official (Elean) list
of Olympiads till the 28th, which was held by the Pisatans. Hence
Falconer and Weissenborn would emend the text of Pausanias (28th
for 8th), and so date Pheidon in 668 B. C. Whether the emendation
be justifiable or not, the date is most suitable (Curtius, Busolt,
<foreign rend="ital">l. c.</foreign>, Macan, Bury, p. 860). Pheidon would thus be placed between
the two Messenian wars at the time of the great Argive victory
over the Spartans at Hysiae (<bibl n="Paus. 2.24.7">Paus. ii. 24. 7</bibl>). This date would also
make it possible for him to have spread abroad the use of the
<foreign lang="greek">Φειδώνεια μέτρα</foreign> (used at Athens before Solon, Ath. Pol. ch. 10), or
rather perhaps of the Aeginetan system of weights and measures.
Lastly, the anachronism here is more intelligible if the 28th Olympiad
be accepted. In a legend Solon and Croesus may well meet, but hardly
Croesus and Lycurgus. Wells (<foreign rend="ital">op. cit.</foreign> pp. 54-62) argues strongly for
placing Pheidon in the eighth century B. C. rather than in the seventh,
and P. Gardner (<foreign rend="ital">op. cit.</foreign> pp. 111-13) inclines to the earlier date.</p>
<p>In any case the anti-Dorian and anti-Argive policy of Cleisthenes
(cf. v. 67) makes the presence of a son or descendant of the Dorian
despot of Argos among the suitors of Agariste improbable. It is
noticeable that the list of suitors contains no representative of the

<p>H.'s account of the Parian expedition shows his characteristic
defects (Introd. &sect; 32): (1) the ascription of great events to petty
personal motives (ch. 133, the rancour of Miltiades); (2) the preference 
for a version of the tale (the Parian) attributing the event to
divine interference. Some critics (e.g. Macan, App. XI) have
therefore preferred the rationalizing version of Ephorus (fr. 107,
F. H. G. i. 263; Steph. Byz. <foreign rend="ital">s. v.</foreign> <foreign lang="greek">Πάρος</foreign>; cf. <bibl n="Nep. Milt. 7">Corn. Nep. Milt. ch. 7, 8</bibl>)
<foreign lang="greek">ὁ δὲ Μιλτιάδης τῶν μὲν ἄλλων νήσων τινὰς ἀποβάσεις ποιησάμενος ἐπόρθησε·

For an isolated attack on Paros is substituted a commission to punish
the islands which had assisted the barbarian, and the subjugation
of several (<cit><bibl n="Nep. Milt. 7">Nepos, Milt. 7</bibl> <quote lang="la">&lsquo;Ut insulas quae barbaros adiuverant
bello persequeretur. Quo imperio plerasque ad officium redire
coegit nonnullas vi expugnavit&rsquo;</quote></cit>). Such an attempt to establish
Athenian dominion in the Cyclades, the dream of Pisistratus (cf.
App. XVI. 8), is in itself probable. Yet even the motive may be
an inference from the pretext given in H. (133. 1), just as the
<pb n="121"/>
supposed signal fire of Datis on Myconos (Nepos' <quote lang="la">in continenti</quote> is
a physical impossibility) is apparently an inference from Datis'
stay at Myconos (ch. 118). The only independent element in
Ephorus (E. Meyer, F. i. 19) appears to be the proverbial phrase
<foreign lang="greek">ἀναπαριάζειν</foreign>, the explanation of which is the kernel of his narrative.
But the explanation is untrustworthy. Miltiades' expedition can
hardly have taken place before the spring of 489 B. C. [there is an
interval after Marathon (autumn 490) during which Miltiades
enjoyed increased fame (ch. 132)], and in 489 B. C. Datis cannot
well have been even thought to be lingering in the neighbourhood
of Myconos. Lastly, the precise duration of the expedition given
by H. (135), twenty-six days, looks like genuine tradition, and contrasts 
favourably with the vague <foreign lang="greek">πολὺν χρόνον</foreign> of Ephorus. Probably
Ephorus, like modern critics, was offended by the shortcomings of
H. and rationalized the traditional story. I have argued in detail
(J. H. S. xxxix (1919), pp. 58-61) that the account in Nepos (Ephorus)
of the Parian expedition and the trial of Miltiades is untrustworthy.</p>

the conquest of Lemnos and Imbros was not the work of the great
Miltiades, but of his namesake and predecessor, the son of
Cypselus (cf. vi. 34 f.), oekist of the Chersonese. If so, he acted as
the agent of Pisistratus (cf. vi. 37) in seizing Lemnos and expelling
the Pelasgi. This would fit in with the prediction (ch. 140. 1),
which regards the conqueror of Lemnos as representing Athens.
Meyer urges that there was no time for the conquest and Hellenizing
(cf. viii. 11) of the island during the troubled period of the Ionic revolt,
so that he would in any case date the settlement of Attic cleruchs
there, even if ascribed to Miltiades II, to the period of Pisistratid rule,
before the Persian conquest of the islands (v. 27). But H. distinctly
says that up to that time the Pelasgi still dwelt there (v. 26 <foreign lang="greek">ἀμφοτέρας
ἔτι τότε ὑπὸ Πελασγῶν οἰκεομένας</foreign>). It seems therefore better to accept
the solution of Busolt (ii. 531; iii. 415) that the Pelasgi, already
weakened by the Persian conquest, were expelled by Miltiades after
500, who settled the island as tyrant of the Chersonese, and that the
Attic cleruchy in Lemnos (<bibl n="Thuc. 7.57">Thuc. vii. 57</bibl>; C. I. A. i. 443, 444) is to
be connected with the reduction of the tribute circ. 447 B. C. Previously, 
as in the Chersonese, there had been settlers from Attica,
not a formal Attic colony.</p>

&lsquo;Nine-Spouts&rsquo; (<bibl n="Thuc. 2.15.5">Thuc. ii. 15. 5</bibl>). The position of CallirhoeEnneacrunus 
is much disputed. That there was a Callirhoe on the
Ilissus is clear; cf. Ps.-Plat. Axiochus 362 A <foreign lang="greek">γενομένῳ μοι κατὰ τὸν
Ἰλισσὸν . . . Κλεινίαν ὁρῶ τὸν Ἀξιόχου θέοντα ἐπὶ Καλλιρόην</foreign>. This site
south of the Acropolis, near the (later) Olympieium, would suit this
passage, since it should be outside the old city and towards Hymettus. 
The ordinary interpretation of Thucydides (ii. 15. 5) favours
the same position. But Pausanias (i. 14. 1) mentions an Enneacrunus, 
apparently in the Agora, somewhere near the Pnyx and the
Areopagus. Most topographers believe in a break in the narrative
of Pausanias (Leake, Curtius) or a mistaken identification of
Enneacrunus on his part (Frazer, ii. 112 f., v. 485 f.; Gardner, Athens,
28 f., 535 f.). But D&ouml;rpfeld (for whose views cf. Harrison's Primitive
Athens) interprets the older authors, and especially Thucydides, in
conformity with the natural meaning of Pausanias, and believes he
has found the true Callirhoe-Enneacrunus in a cistern, conduit, and
other water-works hewn in the rock below the Pnyx (Primitive
Athens, 111-36 and 153 f.).</p>

used as an argument, as Babylon was in a special position till the

Darius was old; on this ground Artaxerxes Mnemon appointed

the Aetolian Apokletoi or select council (Liv. xxxv. 34; Polyb. xx. 1
and 10). Those summoned would include the seven councillors or
princes (Ezra vii. 14, 15; Esther i. 14; cf. <ref target="c.3.14.5" targOrder="U">iii. 14. 5 n.</ref>), together
with the principal officials, satraps, and generals (cf. ch. 8. <foreign lang="greek">δ</foreign>, 19. 2,
26. 2). The scene on the famous Darius vase at Naples (found at
Canosa 1851) is an ideal representation of such a council, leading to
strife between Asia and Hellas. In the upper row are figures of
gods, Asia misled by Apate, Hellas defended by Pallas and Zeus,
Artemis and Apollo. Below, the subjects of the Persian bring
tribute, or express their obedience by kneeling before the king's
treasurer. In the middle row Darius sits on a throne; behind him
stands a young Persian guard, before him an older man in travelling
garb standing on a plinth of gold (<bibl n="Ael. VH 12.62">Ael. V. H. xii. 62</bibl>) earnestly
warns the king. Five councillors sit or stand round, two in
Persian, three in Greek attire. There is no reason to identify this
scene with the council described by H.; the king has the name
Darius inscribed by him, the warning councillor has nothing to
identify him with Artabanus, and half the councillors are in Greek
dress. Cf. Baumeister, p. 408.</p></div3></div>

<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">τὸν Μυσῶν</lemma>. H., our oldest authority, holds that this movement
included both Teucrians and Mysians, and that they passed from
Asia to Europe by the Bosporus, and conquered Thracians as far as
the Peneius and the Adriatic. His grounds appear to be (cf. Stein):</p>
<p>(1) The Paeonians regarded Teucrians from Troy as their
ancestors (cf. v. 13. 2).</p>
<p>(2) Paeonian and kindred races were settled in scattered groups
from the Propontis to the Illyrian mountains, e.g. in North Thessaly,
in the Pelagonian (i. e. Paeonian) Tripolis; cf. the local legends of
Dyrrhachium and the Cestrini on the Adriatic (Appian, B. C. ii. 39;
<bibl n="Paus. 2.23.6">Paus. ii. 23. 6</bibl>).</p>
<p>(3) The Bithynians claimed to be Thracians driven from their
homes on the Strymon by Teucrians (vii. 75) and Mysians.</p>
<p>(4) A number of similar names are found on both sides the
Hellespont (Strabo 590), e.g. in Thrace a river Arisbus, in Lesbos
and the Troad towns called Arisba, at Troy a Scaean gate, in
Thrace a Scaean fort and river.</p>
<p>(5) In Homer Priam's allies extend from Western Asia Minor to
the Axius.</p>
<p>(6) The musical skill and orgiastic rites of Phrygia are attributed
to the earliest Thracians. Strabo, in fact (470-1), completely
identifies the two civilizations.
<pb n="134"/></p>
<p>But, as Macan points out, all of these (except (1), which is itself
disputable) are consistent with a &lsquo;Mysian&rsquo; migration from Thrace
to Asia, while (2) and (3) distinctly favour the idea that the earlier
habitat of the tribes in question was European. We may therefore
prefer the later view (Strabo 295, 566), which represented the
Mysians as immigrants from Thrace or Moesia. This is supported
by H.'s statement (vii. 75) that this Teucro-Mysian movement
drove the Bithynians from the Strymon to Asia, and by the earliest
use of the word Mysian in Homer (<bibl n="Hom. Il. 13.5">Il. xiii. 5</bibl>), where the race is
placed in Thrace or Moesia. [In later passages (<bibl n="Hom. Il. 2.858">Il. ii. 858</bibl>; x. 430)
their habitat is doubtful, though presumably in Asia.] The tradition 
that the crossing was by the Bosporus is confirmed by the
statement of Strabo (566) that it was named of old the Mysian
Bosporus, and by the fact that this would be the natural crossingplace 
from Moesia to maritime Mysia near Cius (E. Meyer, Troas).
Again, the Teucrians seem to have had no connexion with the
Mysians before they met in the Troad, but are best derived from
Cyprus (Meyer, i, &sect; 491 n.).</p>
<p>Finally, H. is led to date the migration before the Trojan war
by the presence of Mysians in Homeric Thrace and their absence
from the Troad. The rival theory naturally dated the movement
into Mysia later, as Mysians and Teucrians are not found in the
Troad in Homer. For a fuller discussion cf. Macan, <foreign rend="ital">ad loc.</foreign></p>

<p>H. distinctly affirms both the completion (ch. 37) and the use of
the canal (ch. 122); cf. <bibl n="Thuc. 4.109">Thuc. iv. 109</bibl>. The ridicule cast on the
assertion in antiquity (Juv. x. 174; Lucian, Dial. Mort. 20) is
entirely undeserved, and the doubts whether it was ever completed
(Stein, Wecklein) are unwarranted. Demetrius of Scepsis, indeed
(Strabo 331, fr. 35), declared that after passing through ten stades
of earth the canal must have been stopped by a bank of rock a
stade broad. At present there are said to be &lsquo;about 200 yards in
the middle where the ground bears no appearance of ever having
been touched. . . . But it is probable that the central part was
afterwards filled up to allow a more ready passage into and out of
the peninsula&rsquo; (Wolfe, ap. Mayor, Juvenal, x. 174). &lsquo;Captain Spratt
(R. G. S., 1847) found distinct traces of the ancient cutting almost
across the whole isthmus, only failing where the canal approached
the sea, and somewhat indistinctly marked in the alluvial plain
north of the hills (cf. also Leake, N. G. iii. 145; Hauvette, p. 291).
The canal forms a line of ponds from two to eight feet deep and
from sixty to ninety broad. It was cut through beds of tertiary
sands and marls, being probably where it was deepest not more
than sixty feet below the natural surface of the ground, which at its
highest point rises only fifty-one feet above the sea-level&rsquo; (Rawlinson).
The work was not great but easy, hence Stein's comparison with
the Corinth canal (cf. App. XVI, &sect; 4), where there is a mile of rock
and the land rises 255 feet above the sea, is misleading.</p>
<p>The distance across, 2,500 yards, agrees nearly with the &lsquo;twelve
stades&rsquo; of H., but its breadth may have been less than he implies
(ch. 24). Demetrius gives 100 feet, which agrees better with the
modern remains (cf. <foreign rend="ital">sup.</foreign>). With the making of the canal may be
connected the hoard of 300 Darics found in the neighbourhood
before 1840 (Borell, Num. Chron. vi. 153). (See note, p. 415.)</p>

mentions it, though he refers repeatedly to the Hellespont Bridge
(Pers. 69 f., 130, 723, 745). Only later did the turning of land into

(<foreign rend="ital">l. c.</foreign>, quoted in full by Grote, Abridgement, p. 170) Xerxes was
perfectly justified in cutting this canal as well from the security
which it afforded his fleet (cf. ch. 22. 1) as from the facility of the
work and the advantages of the ground, which seems made
expressly to tempt such an undertaking. The canal (if renewed)
would be useful for the navigation of the Aegean, since there are
between the Hellespont and Salonica no harbours protected against
the South-West wind (Scirocco), while if the canal were available,
ships might shelter from it in the bay of Acanthus, and from the
North wind in the Singitic gulf (Anderson, Papers of Univ. Coll.,

Tyana to Iconium, and thence to Tyriaeum and Celaenae. But
this route, whether in this form, or in that described by Strabo
(663), seems to be no earlier than the fourth century. As Xerxes
crossed the Halys (&sect; 3), Critalla should be somewhere on the Royal
road (cf. v. 52), perhaps at Caesarea Mazaca, and Xerxes must have
followed the circuitous route of that road by Pteria, Ancyra, and
Pessinus. He must then have turned south into the Maeander
valley to avoid the rough and difficult route by Satala and the
Hermus valley. (See note, p. 416.)</p></div3>

<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">Κελαινάς</lemma>: an important town in the plain at the junction of the
Marsyas and the Maeander. To the north-east was its acropolis
on an outlying spur of the range Djebel-Sultan. Xerxes, on his
return from Greece, is said to have built him a palace by the source
of the Marsyas and a fortress on the acropolis above, while the
younger Cyrus had a palace at the source of the Maeander and
a large park round it (<bibl n="Xen. Anab. 1.2.7">Xen. Anab. i. 2. 7</bibl>, 8). Apameia was built
by Antiochus I (circ. 275 B. C.) above the old town on the banks of
the Marsyas. [For a full description see Ramsay, C. B. pp. 396-483.]
Its most striking feature is the group of springs that form the headwater 
of the Maeander. A coin of Apameia, struck under Gordian,
shows the local goddess surrounded by four river-gods entitled
<foreign lang="greek">Μαί</foreign>(<foreign lang="greek">ανδρος</foreign>), <foreign lang="greek">Μαρ</foreign>(<foreign lang="greek">σύας</foreign>), <foreign lang="greek">Θέρ</foreign>(<foreign lang="greek">μα</foreign>), <foreign lang="greek">Ὀρ</foreign>(<foreign lang="greek">γάς</foreign>). Of these the Therma
must be the modern Ilidja, the only hot-spring of the place, while
the Orgas may be the modern Norgas Chai; the Maeander is
probably the Sheik Arab Su, rising in or near a lake behind a
protruding ridge of Mount Djebel-Sultan, thence rushing down
a ravine into the plain, but afterwards flowing gently round the
spur of the protruding ridge and through the plain till it is joined
by the Marsyas in the lower city of Celaenae. The Marsyas,
called by H. <foreign lang="greek">Καταρρήκτης</foreign>, was a rapid stream 25 feet broad, rising in
<pb n="138"/>
a cave beneath the acropolis, and flowing through the city; cf. <bibl n="Xen. Anab. 1.2.7">Xen.
Anab. i. 2.7</bibl>; Strabo 577-8. Clearly this is the Dineir Water,
described by Hamilton (i. 499): &lsquo;At the base of a rocky cliff
a considerable stream of water gushes out with great rapidity. . . .
It appeared as if it had formerly risen in the centre of a great cavern
and that the surrounding rocks had fallen in from the cliffs above.&rsquo;
This entirely agrees with the descriptions of undoubted eyewitnesses,
Xenophon and Strabo, who state that it rose from beneath the
Acropolis hill. Possibly the Agora was just below, but more probably
H. is in error. For a full discussion of the streams, with many
references, cf. Ramsay, C. B. 397-412, 451-7.</p>
<p>Xenophon (<foreign rend="ital">l. c.</foreign>) says he saw the skin of Marsyas in the cave
where the stream rose. Perhaps the local river-god, Masnes or
Masses (M&uuml;ller, F. H. G. iv. 629), whose stream made music and
whose symbol was a water-skin, was confused with the spirit of
flute-music. At any rate the mythical contest of Apollo and Marsyas
typifies the struggle between the wilder Phrygian flute-music and
the soberer music of the Greek lyre. Hence Marsyas is connected
with other local heroes, &lsquo;inventors&rsquo; of the flute and Phrygian mode,
Hyagnis and Olympus, and also with the worship of the Mother of
the Gods, and of Dionysus.</p>

ever flowed at Colossae through an underground channel five stadia
long, or that arches were formed over it as over some smaller
streams by petrifaction; but the stream does pass through a deep
and narrow cleft of about that length, and in places goes underground

may be explained by the washing away of the coasts by the
strong currents which strike the European shore near Sestos and
then rebound on the Asiatic at Abydos (cf. ch. 36 n.). H., from
the way he gives the measurement here, seems to have held that
both bridges were placed on each occasion at the narrowest part of
the strait, but his view would seem to neglect the following considerations

<p>Clearly to H. the implication was that the Hellespont was
a slave to be scourged and chained; cf. Juv. x. 183, Mayor <foreign rend="ital">ad loc.</foreign>
The scourging, has, however, been interpreted (Spiegel, Eranisch.
Alter. ii. 191) as a religious ceremony, or an attempt by magical rites
to compel the Hellespont to submit. Again, the chains have been
supposed to be an over-literal interpretation of Aeschylus' figurative 
description of the bridges (Pers. 746) <foreign lang="greek">ὅστις Ἑλλήσποντον ἱρόν,
δοῦλον ὥς, δεσμώμασιν  ἤλπισε σχήσειν ῥέοντα, Βόσπορον, ῥόον θεοῦ</foreign>, &verbar; <foreign lang="greek">καὶ

the supposed branding suspicious, considered the other punishments 
(again alleged, ch. 54. 3; viii. 109. 3) a natural trait in
Xerxes, in consonance with other rewards and punishments bestowed 
or inflicted by Persians on irrational or inanimate things
iii. 16; vii. 54, 88). Religious and legal survivals show us how
common the idea once was. Thus at Athens animals which had
killed a human being, as well as inanimate instruments of death,
were tried for murder (<bibl n="Aristot. Ath. Pol. 57">Ath. Pol. 57</bibl>, <foreign rend="ital">ad fin.</foreign>; Dem. Aristocr. 76,
p. 645), and this old-world practice is approved by Plato (Laws,
pp. 873-4). So Pausanias has recorded the punishment of two
statues for accidental homicide (v. 27. 10; vi. 11. 6). The same
point is illustrated by the ritual of the Bouphonia, <bibl n="Paus. 1.24.4">Paus. i. 24. 4</bibl>
(Frazer <foreign rend="ital">ad loc.</foreign>), i. 28. 11; the guilt of slaying the ox is cast on the
inanimate axe or knife. In the Zendavesta (Vendid. xiii. 5. 31)
a dog (cf. <bibl n="Plut. Sol. 24">Plut. Sol. 24</bibl>), in the Jewish law an ox (Exodus xxi.
28), might be punished for murder. Animals were frequently
tried in courts on the continent of Europe from A.D. 1120 to 1740.
Finally, &lsquo;an Old English law only repealed in the reign of Victoria
ordained that a beast that killed a man, a cartwheel that ran
over him, or a tree that fell on him and killed him, was deodand,
given to God, i. e. forfeited and sold for the benefit of the poor&rsquo;

perished, H. had to rely on hearsay, supplemented perhaps by
inspection of the remains of the cables at Athens (&sect; 3; cf. ix. 121).
He adds to the difficulties of the description by attempting to give
us the actual process of construction in four stages:</p>

near enough together to support them, and far enough apart to
keep clear of each other in a high sea&rsquo;. Arrian (Anab. v. 7)
describes the operation as carried out by the Romans, contrasting
their method with that described by H. The varying number of
vessels used in the two bridges is due to the varying breadth of the
straits (cf. 34 n.). H. does not mean that one bridge was built of
triremes and the other of penteconters, but that both triremes and
penteconters were used in both bridges, the triremes being used
where the current flowed strongest, while differences in height
above the water could be met by differences in loading.</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ὑπὸ μὲν τήν</lemma> (<foreign rend="ital">sc.</foreign> <foreign lang="greek">γέφυραν</foreign>). H. regards the cables with the roadway

<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ἐπικαρσίας</lemma> (cf. i. 180. 3; iv. 101. 3 n.), &lsquo;at an angle&rsquo;, and properly
at a right angle (L. &amp; S.).</p>
<p>The passage is taken in two completely different ways:</p>
<p>(1) The whole of it is referred to both bridges (Grote, v. 362 f.;
Rawlinson, Macan). &lsquo;The boats, which are parallel to the stream of
the Hellespont (<foreign lang="greek">κατὰ ῥόον</foreign>), are at a right angle to the Pontus.&rsquo; The
Hellespont in general is of course not at a right angle to the Euxine,
or to the Propontis, if the Pontus includes that (cf. ch. 95 n.), though
the portion between Abydos and Madytus (but not that between
Abydos and Sestos) is. But H., who is often loose in his orientation, 
may well have believed the Hellespont to be at right angles to
<pb n="143"/>
the Pontus. (Schweig. thinking the Pontus too remote, conjectured
<foreign lang="greek">πόρου</foreign>.) On this interpretation H. states rather loosely an obvious fact.</p>
<p>(2) Stein (cf. also Grundy, p. 215; Hauvette, p. 295) takes <foreign lang="greek">ἐπικαρσίας</foreign> 
as referring to the upper (NE.) bridge, and <foreign lang="greek">κατὰ ῥόον</foreign> to the
lower (SW.) one. He takes <foreign lang="greek">ἐπικαρσίας</foreign> to mean &lsquo;athwart the
current&rsquo;, and believes that H. has misunderstood or misreported
his informants. He thinks the passage refers to the peculiarity of
the local currents reported by Strabo (591). The current is not
parallel to the banks, but a little south of Sestos, near the tower of
Hero, runs right across the strait to Abydos (cf. Polyb. xvi. 29),
so that if you want to cross from Sestos to Abydos you row down
to the tower of Hero and then are carried across by the current; if
from Abydos to Sestos, you row a mile along the Asiatic shore
before crossing, so as to avoid meeting the current full. The
landing-place near Sestos was called <foreign lang="greek">Ἀπόβαθρα</foreign>, and here, by the
<foreign lang="greek">Ἀκτὴ Σεστίας καθ’ ἣν τὸ Ξέρξου ζεῦγμα</foreign>, was the end of the north-east
bridge (Strabo 331, fr. 55). Hence the ships of the north-east
bridge would have been &lsquo;oblique&rsquo; to the direction of the straits,
because their prows were turned to face the strong local crosscurrent, 
while those of the south-west bridge would be strictly
parallel to the banks of the Hellespont.</p>
<p>The objections to this interpretation are (1) the inferior meaning
given to <foreign lang="greek">ἐπικαρσίας</foreign> and the extreme difficulty of separating it from
<foreign lang="greek">κατὰ ῥόον</foreign>; (2) the improbability that H., who ignores the current,
should thus indirectly and obscurely allude to its action.</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ἀνακωχεύῃ</lemma> (<foreign rend="ital">sc.</foreign> <foreign lang="greek">ἡ γέφυρα</foreign>): so that the bridge (i. e. here the moored
ships) might give the strained cables support (abstract for concrete;
cf. &sect; 4 and ix. 118. 1). B&auml;hr, however, thinks the cables are those of
the anchors mentioned in the next line, and that the current (<foreign lang="greek">ὁ ῥόος</foreign>)
was to &lsquo;keep these taut&rsquo;.</p></div3>

<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">τῆς δὲ ἑτέρης</lemma>: short for <foreign lang="greek">τὰς δὲ τῆς ἑτέρης</foreign>. Clearly each row of
ships must have had anchors on both sides to keep it in place. H.
is either stating this imperfectly or altogether omits these ordinary
anchors in his anxiety to draw attention to those of special size and
strength on the side of exposure. The north-east bridge would
feel the gales from the Euxine, the south-west one those from the
Aegean.</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ἑσπέρης</lemma>. The Hellespont just below Abydos runs north and

<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ἅμα τῷ ἔαρι</lemma>. Early in April, 480 B. C. Xerxes took three months
to march from the Hellespont to Athens (viii. 54. 1). He probably
reached Athens about the middle of September, and must have
taken ten days at least to march from Thermopylae to Athens
(about 100 miles), which agrees with the fact that the fighting at
Thermopylae took place just after the Olympian festival (Aug.
17-20), that is in the last ten days of August. From Therma to
Thermopylae (about 175 miles) Xerxes had marched rapidly in
fourteen (or perhaps sixteen) days (vii. 183, 196). If we add the
delay at Thermopylae (6-8 days), it follows that Xerxes left
Therma at the beginning of August. He had halted there for a
good many days (vii. 131), and at Abydos (viii. 51 and <foreign rend="ital">sup.</foreign>) a month.
A month is not too long to allow for the march from Sardis to
Abydos (250 miles), nor a month and a half from Sestos to Therma
(over 300 miles). This calculation agrees with H.'s three months
from Sestos to Athens (viii. 51), and adding forty-five days for his
return (viii. 115), with the seven months of the king's absence

in local tradition to connect it with the expedition, superstition
naturally converting such phenomena into omens (cf. i. 74 and vi.
98). The chronology cannot be altered to suit the eclipse of 478,
since its accuracy is guaranteed by the eclipse in the autumn of 480
(cf. ix. 10. 3), and by the fact that the expedition of Xerxes took
place in an Olympic year (vii. 206. 2; viii. 26. 2, 72). Meyer (iii,
&sect; 205 n.) follows Judeich (Hist. Zeit. xlii, 148) in the probable suggestion 
that the error consists in the transference of the eclipse seen
at Susa in 481 to Sardis in 480. If so the connexion with Pythius
would be due to a false combination by H., but the error would be
trifling compared with that of pre-dating the eclipse of 478.</p></div3>

The declaration that the sun is the prophet of the Greeks
might be justified to a Greek by the identification with Apollo, the
god of oracles at Delphi, Branchidae, &amp;c., but it cannot be a Persian
view, since Mithra, the god of light, identified at least in the popular

<div id="c.7.61" type="chapter" n="61">
<p>This full list of the tribal contingents composing the army of
Xerxes with their commanders, and the description of their equipment, 
not only gives us a graphic picture of that immense host, but
also much new and interesting information about the inhabitants
of the Persian Empire. Taken in conjunction with the list of
Satrapies (iii. 90 f.) and the description of the Royal Road (v. 52 f.)
it is our best authority for the ethnography of the Ancient East.
The number of the peoples enumerated (including the name omitted
in ch. 76 and the Sagartians, ch. 85) is sixty-one, and besides the
obvious division into infantry (61-83) from forty-six nations, cavalry
(84-8) from eight nations, and sailors (89-99) from twelve nations,
a geographical arrangement is discernible. First, after the Medes
and Persians, come the Eastern tribes from the Tigris to the Indus
(62-8), secondly the Southern (69-71), thirdly the tribes of Asia
Minor (72-9), and lastly the maritime peoples of the Levant
(89-95).</p>
<p>Following Macan (ii. 167-76) we may distinguish seventeen or
eighteen types of armour in the army and navy of Xerxes to be
grouped in six classes.</p>
<p>I. (1) The Medo-Persian (ch. 61, 62; cf. ch. 80). Besides the bow
and dagger this includes a short spear, and for defence a wicker
shield (<foreign lang="greek">γέρρον</foreign>) and in some cases a cuirass.</p>
<p>II. The Iranians rely on the bow and for hand to hand work on the
dagger; they have no defensive armour. The varieties are (2) the
Bactrians (ch. 64. 1 and 66), with short spears; (3) the Pactyans
(ch. 67, 68; cf. ch. 85); (4) the Scythians, with axes (ch. 64. 2);
and (5) the Sagartians, with lassos (ch. 85).</p>
<p>III. The Anatolians, whose most distinctive weapons are the small
round targe and for offence the javelin, though most of them have
also spear, dagger, or bow. The chief varieties are (6) the Paphlagonian 
(ch. 72, 73); (7) the Thraco-Bithynian (ch. 75); (8) the
Moscho-Colchian (ch. 78, 79); (9) the Cilician (ch. 91; cf. 77); and
(10) the Lycian (ch. 92).</p>
<p>IV. (11) The Assyrians (ch. 63), and (12) Egyptians (ch. 89), who
have metal helmets, large shields, and quilted cuirasses, and for
offence spears, daggers, and pikes or clubs. With these may perhaps 
be classed (13) the Phoenicians (ch. 89), though the character
of their armour is eclectic.</p>
<p>V. (14) The Greeks (ch. 93-5) have metal helmets, greaves, and
<pb n="152"/>
cuirasses, shields, swords, and spears. To this type the Lydians
(ch. 74), Pamphylians (ch. 91), Cypriotes (ch. 90), and Carians
(ch. 93) conform.</p>
<p>VI. The outer barbarians, ill-armed for the most part with bows.
Varieties are (15) the Indians (ch. 65; cf. ch. 70); (16) the African
Ethiopians (ch. 69); (17) the Libyans (ch. 71); and (18) the Arabians
(ch. 69) riding on camels (ch. 87).</p>
<p>In details and arrangement this list differs from that of the
Satrapies (iii. 90 f.), but is not inconsistent with it. While it is impossible 
to say from what source H. derived these lists (Introd., &sect; 21),
in both cases the ultimate authority must be official Persian documents 
such as the king's scribes prepared (ch. 100). The authority
H. followed gave the names of the tribes and their commanders,
and a description of their equipment, but no numbers (ch. 60). As
Meyer (F. ii. 231, 232) suggests, it probably also supplied information 
as to the march from Celaenae to Therma (ch. 26-131), as may be
seen by a comparison of the account to this point with the vague and
imperfect reports of the advance through Thessaly (vii. 196, 197), and
of the retreat of Xerxes (viii. 113-20, 126-9) and of Artabazus (ix. 89).
H. himself added notes (often erroneous) on the origin and early
history of the peoples enumerated (cf. ch. 61. 2, 3, 62. 1, 74. 1, 75. 2),
as he does in the case of the Greeks (viii. 43 f., 72, 73). He supplied 
numbers from conjecture (vii. 184 f.) or tradition (vii. 89); he
inserted conversations of Xerxes with Artabanus and Demaratus,
intended to explain the character and purpose of the great invasion;
but there is no reason to suppose that he used any literary source
except the Persae of Aeschylus, or drew much from the list of the
host of Darius engraved at Byzantium (iv. 87), or the picture of it
dedicated by Mandrocles in the Heraeum at Samos (iv. 88).</p>

<p>No historical conclusions can be drawn from this confused jumble
of myths and names. The Cephenes are a mythical people identified 
with the Eastern Ethiopians (<bibl n="Apollod. 2.4.3">Apollod. ii. 4. 3</bibl>). Possibly H.
means them to be Assyrians (vi. 54), and then by a further confusion
connects the Assyrians with their successors in the lordship of Asia
(cf. ch. 11. 4), the Medes and Persians. But the explanation of the
whole matter is the likeness of the names <foreign lang="greek">Περσεύς</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">Πέρσης</foreign>,
which led the Greeks to make the eponymous <foreign lang="greek">Πέρσης</foreign> son of Perseus
(vii. 150. 2; cf. i. 125. 3; vii. 220. 4), and then, since Perses is related 
to Cepheus, to identify the Persians and the Cephenes. This
genealogy is inconsistent with that given in i. 7, since Belus is grandfather 
(in-law) to Perseus, and Perseus great-grandfather to Heracles,

<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">Ὀτάνεω</lemma>. Stein distinguishes Otanes, father of Amestris (ch. 40,

from the conspirator of Bk. III (cf. vi. 43). The latter would no
doubt have been old for a command, as he must have been about
eighty in 480 B. C., since he had a marriageable daughter in 522 B. C.
(iii. 68). But probably Stein is wrong. The Otanes here must have
been a person of great importance, since he was the king's fatherin-law, 
and he may have been only nominally general of the Persians,
like the colonels of English regiments. His sons, too, have high commands, 
and one of them, Anaphes or Onophas, has the same name
as the son of the conspirator (cf. <ref target="c.3.68" targOrder="U">iii. 68 n.</ref>). Macan suggests that the
fact that H. seems only to know of one Otanes in Bk. VII, as contrasted

<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">Σαλαμῖνος</lemma>. Salamis is a Mycenean centre and afterwards took
the lead among the Greek settlements in Cyprus. The supposed
connexion with the island of Salamis may be an inference from an
accidental similarity of name. The Aeacid Teucer was said to have
fled from home with some Trojan captives and settled in Salamis.
Honours were paid to Teucer as their heroic ancestor by the
Gergithes of the Troad (ch. 43. 2 n.), and the existence at Salamis of
a class called <foreign lang="greek">Γέργινοι</foreign>, who claimed to be Gergithes (Athen. pp. 255,
256) was held to prove the connexion.</p>

Attic.

connecting Cinyras, the founder of the temple at Paphos, with the
Asiatic Aethiopia, i.e. Assyria. Cyprus submitted to Sargon of
Assyria, 709 B.C., and paid tribute to Esar-haddon and Assurbani-pal

seem somewhat later than those in Pamphylia and Cyprus;
Tarsus was ascribed to Argives led by Triptolemus, Mallus to
Amphilochus and Mopsus (Strab. 673, 676); Soli was Rhodian.</p>
<p>Cilix, son of Agenor, brother of Europa, Phoenix, and Cadmus,
seems merely the mythical representation of Phoenician colonization
in Cilicia. Cf. iv. 147. 4 (Thera) and vi. 47. 1 (Thasos). Cilicia
Pedias was naturally connected with Syria, and was conquered by
Sargon of Assyria; but the extent to which the Phoenicians settled
in the land is very doubtful, though some names and cults would
seem to show their influence.</p>
<p>Strabo, 668, seems to have had a fuller text of H. before
him. <foreign lang="greek">φησὶ δ’ Ἡρόδοτος τοὺς Παμφύλους τῶν μετὰ Ἀμφιλόχου καὶ

with this legend most of the Greek settlements in Pamphylia were
believed to be Argive, though Side was colonized from Cyme. The
Greek settlers there forgot their own tongue and spoke a barbarous
dialect (Arrian, Anab. i. 26). Cut off from Hellenism, they were
gradually assimilated by the neighbouring Pisidian and barbaric
tribes. So the legends on the (later) coins of Aspendus, Perga and
Side are Pamphylian not Greek (Head, H. N. 700).</p></div>

her had two sons, Ion and Achaeus. After the death of Erechtheus

these recently conquered Greeks (cf. vi. 31, 49, 99) were far from

the god and the people (cf. Pind. fr. 118 <foreign lang="greek">μαντεύεο Μοῖσα προφατεύσω

<p>H.'s orientation is, as often, loose. He seems to conceive the Strymon

from the north, but really the Strymon here flows from north-west to
south-east and the Angites joins it from the north-east. H., by
making the Angites flow into the Strymon not into a lake, implies
that Lake Cercinitis did not then exist, or was of small importance;
similarly Thucydides (ii. 98) ignores it, and only speaks of <foreign lang="greek">τὸ λιμνῶδες

Persians come to a stream or spring, they dig a pit, and there sacrifice 
their victim, taking care that the pure water near them is not

<p>The division of the army of Xerxes into three columns (cf. ch. 131)
and the account here given, imply a march by three routes, at
least from Doriscus to Acanthus, and in all probability to Therma
(ch. 124 n.). But it is not easy to find in the actual narrative more
than two separate routes. In ch. 110 it seems clear that the centre
under Xerxes went a little inland by the route later famous as the
Via Egnatia, while the left column followed the coast. H., however,
does not realize that the left column, unless it was ferried across
Lake Bistonis, must have returned to the Via Egnatia at the head of
the lagoon, and in any case must have done so at Neapolis. After
Neapolis the left column clearly marched south of Mount Pangaeum,
while another must have followed, as did the Via Egnatia, the
valley of the Angites, north of Mount Pangaeum. The third
column presents a difficulty. W. F. Anderson, Papers of the University 
College of Sheffield (1897), ingeniously accounts for its disappearance 
by suggesting (p. 250) that it had already marched from
Doriscus right up the Hebrus, and that it only rejoined Xerxes at
Therma by the valley of the Axius (ch. 124 n.). Macan, arguing that
no third route is indicated by H. between Doriscus and Acanthus,
suggests that the third division was on board the fleet. Thus
Xerxes might march along the coast (ch. 113) and yet be with the
centre column (ch. 121). On the other hand, the confusion of
routes in ch. 124 makes it more probable that a part of the
<pb n="172"/>
army marched far inland by the Upper Strymon and Echeidorus.
Clearly H. is right in his view that the Persian army marched by
more than one route, but he has not succeeded in keeping the
different columns and routes distinct. For the generals in command 
of the columns cf. ch. 82.</p></div3></div>

from the shortest route from Acanthus to Therma. H. probably
distorted the whole lie of the country, exaggerating the size of
Chalcidice and shortening the inland distances by a misconception
as to the direction of the rivers (ch. 113 n.). He also confused the
route of the three columns. In fact only a detachment can have
gone with Xerxes to Acanthus which is off the line: one column
doubtless marched along the road by Apollonia and Lake Bolbe (cf.
<bibl n="Aesch. Pers. 494">Aesch. Pers. 494</bibl> for the return), another probably went inland by

<div3 id="c.7.128.1" type="section" n="1">
<p>With Xerxes' desire to see the vale of Tempe we may compare
Darius' visit to the Cyanean rocks (iv. 85). His march would not
bring him into the neighbourhood of Tempe (cf. <foreign rend="ital">infr.</foreign>). There are
three roads from lower Macedonia into Thessaly. (1) East of
Mount Olympus along the coast to the mouth of the Peneius, and
up that river to Gonnus through the pass of Tempe; (2) through the
depression between western Olympus and the Pierian hills, called
the pass of Petra, leading to the sources of the river Europus or
Titaresius, and down that river through Perrhaebia; (3) making
a much longer circuit round the mountains up the valley of the
<pb n="175"/>
Haliacmon, and then turning south-east through a deep cleft in the
Cambunian Mountains (the pass of Volustana or Servia) to the
upper valley of the Titaresius. There is also a difficult mountain
path over southern Olympus from Heracleum to Lake Ascuris near
Lapathus, descending thence to Gonnus, the key of Tempe; cf.
Livy xxxiii. 10; xxxvi. 10; xlii. 54. 67. H. would appear to have
imagined there was only one pass besides Tempe (cf. 173. 4), but if
so his account is confused. The repeated emphasis on <foreign lang="greek">παρὰ Γόννον
πόλιν</foreign> (128. 1, 173. 4), and the great labour involved in cutting
a road (ch. 131), point to the mountain path (cf. Liv. xliv. 3 &lsquo;ardua
et aspera et confragosa via fuit&rsquo;; cf. ib. 5), but it is hard to see how
a route so difficult and easily blocked could be described as <foreign lang="greek">ἀσφαλέστατον</foreign> 
(cf. <foreign rend="ital">inf.</foreign>), or could possibly have been used by the whole
Persian army (ch. 151. 1, 173. 4). Again, the expressions <foreign lang="greek">ἐς Περραιβούς, 
διὰ Περραιβῶν</foreign> (131. 1, 173. 4), though possible of the mountain
path, are more appropriate of the two other passes, since after crossing 
the passes of Volustana and Petra a force coming from Macedonia 
to Oloosson (Elassona) has still to traverse the lower passes of
Perrhaebia, i.e. the region between Mount Pindus and the Peneius,
south of Tripolis, to which in 480 B.C. the Perrhaebi were confined.
Again, the phrases <foreign lang="greek">οἱ Μακεδόνες οἱ κατύπερθε οἰκημένοι, ἡ ἄνω Μακεδονίη</foreign>
(cf. 127 n., 173. 4) apply properly to the mountain regions of Orestis,
Lyncestis and Elimia. The Persians would not reach even the
nearest of these districts Elimia unless they went round by the pass
of Volustana (cf. Liv. xlii. 53 &lsquo;(Perseus) postero die in Elimeam ad
Haliacmona fluvium processit. Deinde saltu angusto superatis
montibus, quos Cambunios vocant, descendit ad Azorum Pythium et
Dolichen: Tripolim vocant incolentes&rsquo;). Further, if Xerxes intended
to march by the mountain path which led to Gonnus close to Tempe,
why did he make a special excursion to it from Therma? On the
whole it would seem almost certain that Xerxes must have used the
easier passes of Volustana and Petra for his main force, though a
detachment may have gone by the mountain path. The mountain
path as the shortest circuit would naturally be used in turning the
position of a force holding Tempe (cf. ch. 173), as the Anopaea path
was at Thermopylae, and would therefore be the best known. Its
fame may have obscured the existence of the more distant passes.</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ἀσφαλέστατον</lemma>, &lsquo;the safest way.&rsquo; The way along the marshy strip
of coastland and through the narrow cleft of Tempe could be easily
held by an enemy (Livy xliv. 6), and presented many difficulties for
a large army even if undefended (cf. ch. 173). Even if the mountain
path were also used, the exit from it and from Tempe might be
closed by holding Gonnus (Liv. xxxvi. 10; xlii. 54, 67).</p></div3></div>

and remained distinct till the Roman conquest (Liv. xxxviii. 3 f.;

Hellenic stock who followed Achilles, surnamed <foreign lang="greek">Φθιῶται</foreign> to distinguish

belonged to the Pylaic Amphictyony (ch. 213. 2).</p></div3>
<div3 id="c.7.132.2" type="section" n="2">
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ἔταμον ὅρκιον</lemma>: Homeric, probably from the cutting up of the
victim; cf. iv. 201. 2, and in middle iv. 70. This famous oath,
said by Diodorus (xi. 3) to have been taken by the <foreign lang="greek">σύνεδροι</foreign>
assembled at the Isthmus, must either have been general in its
terms, and have been directed against <foreign lang="greek">οἱ μηδίζοντες</foreign> without naming
them individually, or must be placed after the battle of Thermopylae.
Thebes was not openly on the Persian side till that time (ch. 205),
and the Opuntian Locrians seem to have resisted stoutly till after
Artemisium (ch. 203. 1; viii. 1. 2; ix. 31. 5); even the Thessalians
did not Medize till Tempe was evacuated (ch. 172). Yet the
indicative <foreign lang="greek">ὅσοι ἔδοσαν</foreign> (not <foreign lang="greek">ὅσοι ἂν δῶσι</foreign>) would seem to refer to
a definite list of states, such as that given just above. Abicht
would therefore identify this oath with that said to have been
sworn before the battle of Plataea (Polyb. ix. 39) and given by
Diodorus (xi. 29) and Lycurgus (in Leoc. 81). But this oath
before Plataea seems to be a later invention. (1) It is not
mentioned by H. (2) It is attributed by Diodorus (xi. 29) to the
Greeks assembled at the Isthmus, whereas the Athenians did not
join the army till it reached Eleusis. (3) Theopompus (fr. 167,
<pb n="178"/>
F. H. G. i. 306) declared it to be an Athenian invention, an assertion
supported by the fact that its formula seems borrowed from the
ephebic oath at Athens. (4) The clause forbidding the restoration of
temples destroyed by the barbarians is most improbable. It seems
better therefore to hold that the oath of the confederates, whose
reality is supported by the proverbial phrase <foreign lang="greek">τὸ πάλαι λεγόμενον δεκατευθῆναι 
Θηβαίους</foreign> (<bibl n="Xen. Hell. 6.3.20">Xen. Hell. vi. 3. 20</bibl>, 5. 35), was taken just before
the invasion as H. and Diodorus (xi. 3. 2) state. H. may have
committed a slight anachronism in giving at this point a definite
list of Medizing states, and not a general formula, or possibly the
Thebans and Locrians were added later to the list of the
&lsquo;proscribed&rsquo; made just before the invasion.</p>
<p>If we could believe Diodorus (xi. 3), the hill-tribes&mdash;i.e. the
Aenianes, Dolopes, Malians, Perrhaebians, Magnetes&mdash;Medized
while the Greek force was still at Tempe (and so caused its withdrawal), 
whereas the Achaeans, Opuntian Locrians, Thessalians
(proper, cf. &sect; 1), and Boeotians only Medized when the Greeks
withdrew. But the silence of H. shows that this was unknown
to him.</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">δεκατεῦσαι</lemma> cannot mean merely to exact a tithe from (Abicht,
B&auml;hr), as even if a tenth of the population was dedicated to the
god, as Strabo relates of the Mysians (572) and of the Chalcidian
colonists of Rhegium (257), as well as of their property, the penalty
would be far milder than was usual in such cases. No doubt the
original meaning of a <foreign lang="greek">δεκατεύειν</foreign> is to &lsquo;tithe&rsquo; exact a tenth of goods,
revenue, or produce (<bibl n="Xen. Anab. 5.3.9">Xen. Anab. v. 3. 9</bibl> f.), and the most usual
occasion for exacting such a tithe was the dedication to god of
a tenth of the booty won in war (cf. v. 77. 4; viii. 27. 5; ix. 81. 1).
Here, however, the meaning is surely the total destruction of
the cities, involving the sale of the population into slavery and
the confiscation of all goods and lands: from the proceeds a tenth
would be dedicated to the god. This was the doom of traitors at
Athens (cf. the Hermokopids, Hicks, 72; the generals condemned
after Arginusae, <bibl n="Xen. Hell. 1.7.10">Xen. Hell. i. 7. 10</bibl>, 20); this is the procedure of
Camillus at Veii (Liv. v. 21, 23, 25), and is implied in the tale of the
capture of Sardis (i. 89). This seems a better way of accounting
for the total confiscation implied than merely to take <foreign lang="greek">δεκατεῦσαι</foreign> in
the vague sense = &lsquo;dedicate&rsquo; (Stein). And that total destruction
was vowed against the traitors can hardly be doubted; in the case
of Thebes it became proverbial; cf. Polyb. ix. 39. 5; <bibl n="Xen. Hell. 6.3.20">Xen. Hell.
vi. 3. 20</bibl>, 5. 35 <foreign lang="greek">νῦν ἐλπὶς τὸ πάλαι λεγόμενον δεκατευθῆναι Θηβαίους</foreign>.
This is also supported by the proposal to evict the Medizers and
take their lands for the Ionians (ix. 106). Doubtless it was not
carried out as most of them could shelter themselves under the
proviso <foreign lang="greek">μὴ ἀναγκασθέντες</foreign>, and the Aleuadae saved themselves by
bribery (cf. vi. 72).</p></div3></div>

<p>That the vengeance should fall on ambassadors was natural
enough since the offence had been committed against ambassadors,
but that it should fall on the sons of the very men who had taken
the guilt of the community on themselves, but had not been allowed
to expiate it, was a striking fulfilment of the law that the children
must suffer for the sins of the fathers (Ezekiel, ch. xviii; St. John

ix. 2, 3), and that the divine Nemesis, which had apparently slept,

<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ὃς εἶλε</lemma>. The feat was the more remarkable as Aneristus had
only a merchantman. Halieis was a small port on the southern
point of the Argolic Acte, in the territory of Hermione, opposite the

the destruction of Tiryns by Argos (after 468 B.C., cf. vi. 83. 2), as

and in 468 an Olympic victor is still styled <foreign lang="greek">Τιρύνθιος</foreign> (Ox. Pap. ii,

<p>For the facts cf. <bibl n="Thuc. 2.67">Thuc. ii. 67</bibl>. He adds three other victims&mdash;a
Spartan Stratodemus, a Tegean Timagoras, and an Argive Pollis&mdash;
whom H. omits, lest they should spoil the moral of the story of
retribution, already weakened by the inclusion of Aristeus the
Corinthian (for whom cf. <bibl n="Thuc. 1.60">Thuc. i. 60</bibl> f. and Introd. &sect; 30 (<foreign rend="ital">c</foreign>). Thucydides 
further ascribes the treacherous arrest of the envoys, not to
Nymphodorus and Sitalces (for whom cf. <ref target="c.4.80" targOrder="U">iv. 80 n.</ref>), but to his son
Sadocus. Nevertheless the intervention of Nymphodorus is quite
probable, since he as Athenian Proxenus induced his brother-in-law
Sitalces to make alliance with Athens, and obtained Athenian
citizenship for Sadocus (<bibl n="Thuc. 2.29">Thuc. ii. 29</bibl>), and in any case Sadocus
must have gained his father's consent.</p>
<p>It would seem probable that this striking example of the doctrine
of Nemesis drew H.'s attention in 430 B.C. to the fate of the Persian
heralds, and led him to insert the story in the part of his history
which he was then revising, and not in its proper place (vi 49).
Though there are suspicious points in it (e.g. that the barathron
and the well would supply earth and water, Wecklein, Sitz. der Bayer.
Akad. 1876, p. 230) there seems no sufficient reason for rejecting the
whole story (as Macan, Herod. iv-vi, vol. ii, pp. 98-100), or even for
denying that Athens emulated Sparta's violation of the sanctity of
heralds (Wecklein, <foreign rend="ital">loc. cit.</foreign>; Duncker, vii. 108; Busolt, ii. 571). It
does not seem incredible (<foreign rend="ital">pace</foreign> Macan) that even after the rejection
by Athens of Persian demands for earth and water (v. 73) and for the
restoration of Hippias (v. 96), and even after the burning of Sardis
(498 B.C.) and the anger caused by it (v. 102, 105), Darius should
have in 492 B.C. given Athens a last chance of repentance, when he
was sending heralds round Greece (vi. 48), even though the mission
of Mardonius (vi. 44 f.) and the levying of a fleet (vi. 48) show that
he expected war. It is difficult to see when or why this story of the
maltreatment of heralds should have been invented, and there is
nothing incredible in it, especially if (Hauvette, p. 231) they were
<pb n="181"/>
Greek interpreters, who might be regarded by an angry people as
traitors. The Spartans at least, as Macan admits, had something
on their conscience, or we should hardly have had this story of the

<p>As Munro (Cl. Rev. vi. 333) has pointed out, there seem to have
been two distinct systems of chronology for the life of Themistocles,
differing by ten years. The confusion may have been caused by
the fact that the two Persian invasions were just ten years apart,
and the two Athenian expeditions to Cyprus and Egypt were also
ten years apart. The fixed points in both are that Themistocles
died at the age of sixty-five, and that he was archon <foreign rend="ital">suo anno</foreign>, i.e.
at the age of thirty. The better chronology runs as follows:</p>
<p>523 B.C. Themistocles born. He belonged to the old Attic
family of the Lycomidae, but his mother was a Thracian or Carian
(<bibl n="Plut. Them. 1">Plut. Them. 1</bibl>).</p>
<p>493 B.C. Themistocles archon eponymus (Dion. Hal. vi. 34)
begins the building of Piraeus (<bibl n="Thuc. 1.93">Thuc. i. 93</bibl>; <bibl n="Paus. 1.1.2">Paus. i. 1. 2</bibl>).</p>
<p>490 B.C. Fought in command of his tribe at Marathon (<bibl n="Plut. Arist. 5">Plut.
Arist. 5</bibl>).</p>
<p>483 B.C. Carried through the decree for the building of a great
navy (ch. 144; <bibl n="Aristot. Ath. Pol. 22">Ath. Pol. 22</bibl>); his chief rival Aristides (cf. viii. 79;
<bibl n="Aristot. Ath. Pol. 22">Ath. Pol. 22</bibl>) ostracized.</p>
<p>471 B.C. Ostracism of Themistocles (Diodorus, xi. 55; Cic. de
Amicit. xii. 42; Meyer, iii. &sect; 286 n.).</p>
<p>467 B.C. Flight from argos, since he goes up to Susa when
Artaxerxes has just become king (<foreign lang="greek">νεωστὶ βασιλεύοντα</foreign>, <bibl n="Thuc. 1.137">Thuc. i. 137</bibl>),
i.e. in 465 B.C. Later writers say Themistocles was introduced to
<foreign rend="ital">Xerxes</foreign> by Artabanus (<bibl n="Plut. Them. 27">Plut. Them. 27</bibl>; Diod. xi. 56, following
Ephorus). This mistake is best explained if Themistocles reached
<foreign rend="ital">Asia</foreign> while Xerxes was still alive, and <foreign rend="ital">Susa</foreign> after his death, while
Artabanus was still in power.</p>
<p>459-458 B.C. Death of Themistocles (<bibl n="Thuc. 1.138">Thuc. i. 138</bibl>). The early
tradition that he poisoned himself (Ar. Eq. 83. 4; Thuc. 1. 138),
because he could not fulfil his promise of subduing Hellas, points to
some such crisis as the Athenian expedition to Cyprus and Egypt.
On the other hand, Plutarch (Them. 31; Cim. 18) connects the
death of Themistocles with Cimon's expedition in 449, and since he
gives his age at sixty-five, presumably placed his archonship in
483-482, a date modified by Busolt (ii. 642 n.) to 482-481, and the
Ath. Pol. (ch. 25) represents him as still at Athens in 462 B.C., and
presumably placed his ostracism in 462-461. But this date for
Themistocles' ostracism has been proved impossible (Walker, Cl.
Rev. vi. 95 f.), and that for his death is most unlikely.</p>
<p>The only difficulty in the chronology preferred, apart from <foreign lang="greek">νεωστὶ
παριών</foreign> (<foreign rend="ital">inf.</foreign>), is the long separation between the fortification of
Piraeus (493) and the building of the fleet (483). But we must
remember that little may have been done at Piraeus for a time,
<pb n="185"/>
since between 493-483 Athens had much to engage her energy
and resources. Indeed, though Hippias had made a beginning at
Munychia (<bibl n="Aristot. Ath. Pol. 19">Ath. Pol. 19</bibl>), Phalerum was still the port of Athens in
490 B.C.; cf. vi. 116. In any case it is clear that a better port and
dock than that open roadstead was a necessary preliminary to the
creation of a great navy.</p>
<div3 id="c.7.143.1" type="section" n="1">
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">νεωστὶ παριών</lemma>: the participle is an imperfect, &lsquo;who had but lately

δυναστείαν</foreign>. The word <foreign lang="greek">νεωστί</foreign> has been used as an argument for
bringing down the archonship of Themistocles to 482 B.C, but the
expression cannot be pressed in H. (cf. vii. 148. 2), or, if it were
it might refer to the recent triumph of his naval policy and the
ostracism of Aristides.</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">εἶχε  εἰρημένον</lemma>: according to Stein=<foreign lang="greek">εἴρητο</foreign>; cf. iii. 48. 1 <foreign lang="greek">ὕβρισμα

<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ἀλλά</lemma> (<foreign rend="ital">sc.</foreign> <foreign lang="greek">ἐκέλευον</foreign>, ch. 104. 5). The official interpreters tried to
harmonize the two oracles by supposing that the second also recommended 
flight (e.g. to Siris, cf. viii. 62), only particularizing the
ships as the means of flight and promising eventual safety. Very
possibly this was the meaning primarily intended by the Delphic
priesthood (Hauvette, p. 326), but the oracle could also be interpreted 
in Themistocles' sense, and was thus safe in either case.</p></div3></div>

<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ἑτέρη  γνώμη ἔμπροσθε ταύτης</lemma>. Dated in Ath. Pol. ch. 22 to
483-482 B.C. Though this date may be connected with the later
chronology for Themistocles' life (cf. <foreign rend="ital">sup.</foreign>), it is confirmed by other
notices in H. The creation of the navy is clearly later than the
expedition to Paros (490-489 B.C.), for which Miltiades has but
seventy ships (vi. 132), even if that number be accepted; it is also
later than and due to the war with Aegina (probably 488-486 B.C.),
in which the Athenians had but fifty ships of their own (cf. <ref target="c.6.89" targOrder="U">vi. 89 n.</ref>).</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ἐν τῷ κοινῷ</lemma>, &lsquo;in the treasury&rsquo;; cf. ix. 87. 2.</p>
<p>Laurium (on which see Ardaillon, Les Mines du Laurion) is the
name given by the ancients to the whole hilly and metalliferous
region ending in Cape Sunium, and bounded on the north by a line
from Thoricus to Anaphlystus (cf. <ref target="c.4.99" targOrder="U">iv. 99 n.</ref>). The mines produced
silver and lead in abundance. They had been worked from time
immemorial (Xen. de Vect. iv, &sect; 2), and from them Pisistratus
(i. 64 n.) drew great wealth, as did Nicias and Hipponicus later
(Xen. de Vect. iv, &sect; 14). They were still important in the Peloponnesian 
war (<bibl n="Thuc. 6.91">Thuc. vi. 91</bibl> <foreign rend="ital">ad fin.</foreign>), but were less productive,
though by no means exhausted, in the time of Xenophon (Vect. iv.
35. 25 f.; Mem. iii. 6. 12). They had been long abandoned in the
days of Pausanias (i. 1. 1). Since 1860 much ore has been extracted
from the stones and slag formerly thrown aside, an operation
<pb n="186"/>
already attempted in the days of Strabo (399). The workings,
in which only slaves were employed, consisted of shafts and
galleries, whose roof was supported by columns (Ardaillon, <foreign rend="ital">op. cit.</foreign>
25 f.). The mines were the property of the State, but were leased
to individuals (usually for three years, <bibl n="Aristot. Ath. Pol. 47">Ath. Pol. 47</bibl>), a net sum
being paid down (often a talent), and also one twenty-fourth of the
produce annually.</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ὀρχηδόν</lemma>: in a row, <foreign rend="ital">viritim</foreign>; cf. <foreign lang="greek">εἰλαδόν</foreign>, i. 172. 1; <foreign lang="greek">ἡβηδόν</foreign>, i. 172. 2;

<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">δέκα</lemma> = <foreign rend="ital">denas.</foreign> If the citizens be reckoned at 30,000 (v. 97. 2 n.)

to build a fleet of fifty ships (cf. <foreign rend="ital">inf.</foreign>).</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">τῆς διαιρέσιος  παυσαμένους</lemma>. H. leaves it uncertain whether
this distribution was exceptional or regular. Plutarch (Them. 4)
speaks of a regular, and Cornelius Nepos (<bibl n="Nep. Them. 2">Them. 2</bibl>) of an annual,
distribution; this was the custom at Siphnos (iii. 57. 2), and perhaps
at Thasos (vi. 46. 3). The Atthis, which is followed by <bibl n="Aristot. Ath. Pol. 22">Ath. Pol. 22</bibl>
and Polyaenus, i. 30, spoke, probably rightly, of an exceptional
surplus amounting to one hundred talents, due to the discovery of
a fresh mine at Maroneia, a village in the district of Laurium.
This sum was handed over to one hundred rich citizens, that each
of them might build a trireme.</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">διηκοσίας</lemma>. This is H.'s figure for the full strength of the Athenian
navy (viii. 1 and 14, 44 and 46, 61; cf. Justin, ii. 12), and should not
therefore be struck out. He apparently forgot that the navy already
amounted to at least fifty ships (vi. 89 n., 132). The later writers,
quoted above, while increasing the sum spent to one hundred
talents (<bibl n="Aristot. Ath. Pol. 22">Ath. Pol. 22</bibl>; Polyaen. i. 30), all reduce the number of <foreign rend="ital">new</foreign>
ships to one hundred. Macan (ii. 214), combining the different
versions, suggests an annual increase of fifty ships for two or three
years.</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">τὸν πρὸς Αἰγινήτας λέγων</lemma>. Thucydides (i. 14) also gives this war
as one of the motives for the creation of the navy, though he
evidently thinks the expected Persian invasion more important.
Probably Themistocles really looked forward to naval supremacy
and empire in the Aegean (<foreign lang="greek">τὴν ἀρχὴν εὐθὺς συγκατεσκεύασε</foreign>, <bibl n="Thuc. 1.93">Thuc. i.
93</bibl>), but wisely preferred in his speeches to the Athenians (<bibl n="Plut. Them. 4">Plut.
Them. 4</bibl>) to insist on the need of the moment, rather than on less
pressing dangers or more distant hopes. H.'s next words probably
mean that it was the Aeginetan war which induced the Athenians to
listen to Themistocles, while Thucydides (i. 14) insists more directly
on Themistocles' foresight.</p></div3>
<div3 id="c.7.144.2" type="section" n="2">
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ἔδεε</lemma> (cf. viii. 6. 2). These ships were intended to form a reserve
to take the place of those lost or damaged. Thus, in spite of
losses at Artemisium (viii. 16, 18), the Athenian fleet is still reckoned
as two hundred strong at Salamis. But was there time to build more
ships? The figures can be explained otherwise (cf. App. XIX, &sect; 1).

<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">τῶν δὴ εἵνεκα</lemma>. The Argives were evidently anxious to absolve
themselves of the charge of Medism. Hence they allege that they
were only led to consult the oracle at all by the deplorable straits to
which they had been reduced through their defeat by Cleomenes.
They then were expressly warned to remain neutral, but nevertheless
were willing to join the alliance, if Sparta would grant a peace for
<pb n="188"/>
thirty years, and recognize their claim to an equal share in the
leadership. There is no sufficient reason for doubting the genuineness 
of the oracle, which was in H.'s opinion given about 482 B. C.
(<foreign lang="greek">αὐτίκα κατ’ ἀρχάς</foreign>, cf. ch. 220. 3), but may really date back to the
earlier Persian invasion, and sending of heralds in 491-490 B. C.
(vi. 49), for had it been an Argive fiction it would have been disowned 
at Delphi after the defeat of Xerxes. The attitude of the
Delphic priesthood, whether from fear or treachery, was before the
war one of hostility to the league of patriots. Again, the negotiations
with Sparta are a very pretty piece of diplomacy. Argos knew that
Sparta would not concede equality, and could therefore safely use
the demand to cover her Medism and justify her neutrality. H.
does not explicitly reject the special pleading of Argos because he
is influenced by Athenian tenderness for a city which later became
a useful ally (cf. Introd., &sect; 30 <foreign rend="ital">e</foreign>).</p></div3>

a widely extended suzerainty, and Argos claimed to succeed to the

sons of the Heraclid Aristomachus cast lots for the lands of the
Peloponnese, Argos fell to the eldest son Temenus. For similar
claims founded on legendary history cf. v. 43, 94, and above all the
dispute between Athens and Tegea, ix. 26f. Pheidon (cf. vi. 127.

hope of reasserting it still lived at Argos in the Peloponnesian war
(<bibl n="Thuc. 5.27">Thuc. v. 27</bibl>, 28), and made the Argives constantly ready to ally
themselves with the enemies of Sparta, e. g. Athens in 461 and

ch. 134. 2). Cf. App. XVII, &sect; 2.</p>
<p>According to Pausanias (ii. 19. 2) the Argive kings in the
second generation from Temenus lost all real power [Pheidon's reassertion 
of royal power later being regarded as a Tyranny], and ten
generations later, Meltas, the last Heraclid, was deposed. Plutarch
(Mor. 340 C) says that Aegon was made king after the fall of the
Heracleids. Presumably the monarch only retained the old royal
right to priesthood and other formal honours, perhaps presidency of
the Boule.</p>
<p>Since the law said to have been passed in the days of Cleomenes I
(cf. v. 75), that only one king should go with the army, was observed
in practice, the Spartan reply is a mere evasion. H. would seem

<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ἑτέρου πρήγματος εἵνεκα</lemma>. There is no reason to doubt that Callias
went to Susa to negotiate for a peace about 448 B. C. (Aristodemus,
xiii. 2; F. H. G. v, p. 16; Diodorus, xii. 4; Demosthenes, de Fals. Leg.
273; <bibl n="Paus. 1.8.2">Paus. i. 8. 2</bibl>; <bibl n="Plut. Cim. 13">Plut. Cim. 13</bibl>). Nor is there any question that
after the death of Cimon peace in fact existed between Athens and
Persia, as is shown by the regular trade with Phoenicia (<bibl n="Thuc. 2.69">Thuc. ii.
69</bibl>; viii. 35) and with other parts of the Persian Empire (Ps. Xen.
Pol. Ath. ii. 7 <foreign lang="greek">ἢ ἐν Κύπρῳ ἢ ἐν Αἰγύπτῳ ἢ ἐν Λυδίᾳ</foreign>), and by the fact that
H., a subject of the Athenian empire, travelled freely in the East.
<pb n="190"/>
Indeed, the Athenians at the beginning of the Peloponnesian war
have hopes of help from the Persian king (<bibl n="Thuc. 2.7">Thuc. ii. 7</bibl>), and repeatedly
send envoys to him (<bibl n="Aristoph. Ach. 61">Arist. Ach. 61</bibl> f.; <bibl n="Thuc. 4.50">Thuc. iv. 50</bibl>).</p>
<p>The question whether a formal peace was concluded is more
doubtful. The earliest distinct mention of it is by Isocrates, Panegyricus, 
&sect;&sect; 117-20, circ. 380 B. C., who repeats the terms in the
Areopagiticus, &sect; 80 (355 B. C.) and the Panathenaicus, &sect; 59
(340 B. C.). It is mentioned also in the Menexenus (242 A) and
twice by Demosthenes (pro Rhod. 29 and de Fals. Leg. 273), as well
as by Lycurgus (in Leoc. 73). Its omission by Thucydides in his
brief account of the period has been deemed by many fatal to its
reality. But it should be noticed that the indignant rejection in
411 B. C. by the Athenians (who were prepared to give up Ionia) of
the demand that the Persian should be allowed to sail where he
would along his own coasts (<bibl n="Thuc. 8.56">Thuc. viii. 56</bibl>), proves the existence of
some convention excluding the Persian fleet from the Aegean.
Further, it appears almost certain that a treaty was made with
Darius II soon after his accession (circ. 423 B. C.), since not only
does Andocides state that Epilycus, his own first cousin, made peace
and eternal alliance with the king (Andoc. de Pace 29), but on
a contemporary inscription, Heraclides of Clazomenae is thanked
for his help in securing the success of the embassy to the king
(C. I. A. (vol. iv.) ii. 5 c). It would be extraordinary that Thucydides 
should omit all mention of this, unless it was a mere renewal
on the accession of another king of an older convention. It may
therefore be argued that Thucydides indirectly confirms the fact of
an understanding with Persia about 448 B. C. The fact which led
Theopompus (fr. 168, F. H. G. i, p. 306) to question the existence
of a peace, viz. that the inscription recording it was in Ionic letters,
indicates at most that the record was not contemporary (though
some Attic inscriptions even before 403 B. C. were written in Ionic
letters (Hicks 36, 50, 73)); in any case it was accepted as genuine
by Craterus, who gave a copy in his collection of Inscriptions.</p>
<p>For the terms we are unfortunately dependent on the fourthcentury 
orators and late historians who are undoubtedly guilty of
gross exaggerations. The limits fixed for ships of war, the Cyanean
rocks (<bibl n="Dem. 19.273">Dem. de Fals. Leg. 273</bibl>; Aristodem. xiii. 2; <bibl n="Lyc. 1.73">Lycurg. in Leoc.
73</bibl>; <bibl n="Diod. 12.4.5">Diod. xii. 4. 5</bibl>) and Phaselis (Isoc. Panegr. 118; Areopag. 80;
Panath. 59; Diod. <foreign rend="ital">l. c.</foreign>; Lycurg. <foreign rend="ital">l. c.</foreign>, supported by the fact that
Phaselis was a member of the Delian league), are probably correct,
though Demosthenes (<foreign rend="ital">l. c.</foreign>) and Plutarch (Cim. 13) substitute for
Phaselis the more conspicuous landmark of the Chelidonian isles.
On the other hand, the stipulation that the king's armies should not
come nearer the coast than one day's march for cavalry (Dem. Plut.
<foreign rend="ital">l. c.</foreign>) or three days for infantry (Diod. <foreign rend="ital">l. c.</foreign>) &lsquo;if ever made&rsquo; must often
have been broken, and Isocrates' limit, the Halys, is a gross and
foolish exaggeration.
<pb n="191"/></p>
<p>Finally, the notion that the peace secured autonomy for all Greek
cities (Lycurg. <foreign rend="ital">l. c.</foreign>; <bibl n="Diod. 12.4">Diod. xii. 4</bibl>, 5. 26. 2) is clearly a later invention
designed to heighten the contrast with the peace of Antalcidas. It
is contradicted by the abandonment of Cyprus to the Persian, and
by contemporary evidence that the great king never formally relinquished 
his claims even to Ionia (<ref target="c.6.42" targOrder="U">Hdt. vi. 42 n.</ref>; <bibl n="Thuc. 8.5">Thuc. viii. 5</bibl>).
This is the reason why H. makes no mention of the peace here,
covering it over with the vague phrase <foreign lang="greek">ἑτέρου πρήγματος εἵνεκα</foreign>. In the
fifth century it was discreditable to Athens to relinquish Cyprus and
Egypt, to give up the crusade against Persia and turn her arms against
other Hellenes (<bibl n="Thuc. 3.9.4">Thuc. iii. 9. 4</bibl>), and to obtain from the great king only
a grudging recognition of undeniable facts, but in the fourth century
this same convention could be elevated by contrast with the base
betrayal of Greece by Sparta at the peace of Antalcidas (387 B. C.)
into a triumphant assertion of Greek liberties and Greek empire.</p>
<p>On the peace of Callias cf. further E. Meyer, F. ii. 71-82; Busolt,

point if it be remembered that Argos had been since 462 B. C. in
alliance with Athens, the enemy of Persia (<bibl n="Thuc. 1.102">Thuc. i. 102</bibl>). About 450,
however (<bibl n="Thuc. 5.14">Thuc. v. 14</bibl>, 28, 40), Argos made a thirty years' peace
with Sparta, and apparently aimed at returning to her old position
of neutrality.</p></div>

<p>For the form of this <foreign lang="greek">γνώμη</foreign> cf. iii. 38. 1. The attempt to excuse

may well be the tyrant of Leontini (<bibl n="Paus. 5.22.7">Paus. v. 22. 7</bibl>), established by
Hippocrates. The family of the Emmenidae traced their origin
back to Theras (cf. <ref target="c.4.147" targOrder="U">iv. 147 n.</ref>). One of Thero's ancestors came
from Lindus in Rhodes to Gela, and thence to Acragas, where
Telemachus, his grandfather, overthrew the tyrant Phalaris in Ol. 57.</p></div3>

<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ἴσα ἔτεα</lemma>: for seven years, 498-491 B. C.</p>
<p>There were in Sicily three towns called Hybla all originally Sicel.
The first was superseded by the Greek colony Megara (Strabo 268),
on the coast ten miles north of Syracuse; the Sicel town stood on
a little height north of the hill of Megara. Thucydides calls the
town Megara (vi. 49, 94), and H. its citizens Megarians (ch. 156. 2);
both record its destruction by Gelo in 483 B. C. (ch. 156; Th. vi. 4).
The second, called by Thucydides (vi. 62) <foreign lang="greek">Γελεᾶτις</foreign>, was in his time
still a Sicel town (vi. 94); it is called by Pausanias (v. 23. 4)
<foreign lang="greek">Γερεᾶτις</foreign>, and by Steph. Byz. <foreign rend="ital">s. v.</foreign> and Cicero (de Div. i. 20, 39)

between Catana and Centuripa (<bibl n="Thuc. 6.94">Thuc. vi. 94</bibl>), and may be placed
at Paterno, where an inscription has been found, &lsquo;Veneri victrici
Hyblensi.&rsquo; The third, called <foreign lang="greek">Ἡραία</foreign>, on the road between Gela and
Syracuse (Itin. Anton. p. 89), may be placed at or near Ragusa;

<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">γαμόροι</lemma>. The name, Doric in form, clearly comes from local
Sicilian sources. Like the <foreign lang="greek">γεωμόροι</foreign> of Samos (<bibl n="Thuc. 8.21">Thuc. viii. 21</bibl>), they
were a land-holding aristocracy. Probably the earliest settlers
secured for themselves exclusive possession of the full rights of
citizenship, and especially of holding land (<foreign lang="greek">ἔγκτησις γῆς</foreign>). Their
holdings were cultivated by serfs (<foreign lang="greek">δοῦλοι</foreign>), probably the relics of the
old native population reduced to a position of villeinage.</p>
<p>The <foreign lang="greek">Κυλλύριοι</foreign> or <foreign lang="greek">Καλλικύριοι</foreign>, who drove out their masters the
<foreign lang="greek">Γαμόροι</foreign> (Timaeus, fr. 56; F. H. G. i. 204), were compared by
Aristotle in his Syracusan constitution to the Helots, the Penestae
in Thessaly, and the Clarotae in Crete (F. H. G. i. 170). The
<foreign lang="greek">γαμόροι</foreign> formed a high court of justice like the comitia at Rome
(Diod. viii. 11). The fall of the <foreign lang="greek">γαμόροι</foreign> is connected by Aristotle
(Pol. v. 4. 1, 1303 b 20) and Plutarch (Mor. 825 C) with a private
<pb n="195"/>
feud. It probably took place but a few years before Gelo mastered
Syracuse, perhaps only after the defeat of the Syracusans on the
Helorus (ch. 154). Clearly the excluded Demos, the town population
mainly of Greek origin, joined with native serfs against their
masters (cf. Dionys. Hal. vi. 62; <bibl n="Aristot. Pol. 5.1302b">Ar. Pol. v. 3, 5, 1302 b 32</bibl>; and

victory at Olympia in 488-487 B. C. (<bibl n="Paus. 6.9.4">Paus. vi. 9. 4</bibl>). Hence Pausanias'
statement that he became lord of Syracuse in 491 B. C. is a confusion
between the beginning of his rule at Syracuse and his first attainment 
of tyranny at Gela (cf. Busolt, ii. 779 n. 3).</p></div3></div>

i. 416) in identifying this strife with the great campaign which
culminated at the Himera, placing that battle in 481 B. C.; but
this is absolutely opposed to the clear meaning of H. (Freeman, ii.
478). Again, the synchronism between the Persian and Carthaginian
invasions seems well established (cf. 166 n.); H. makes the Himera
coincide with Salamis (ch. 166), and is followed, though more
cautiously, by Aristotle (Poet. 23); Diodorus (xi. 24) places it on
the last day of the fighting at Thermopylae. Further, there is a
high probability that there was some concerted arrangement between 
the Persian and the Carthaginian (Ephorus fr. 111; F. H. G.
i. 264; Diod. xi. 1; ch. 166 n.). (2) Others (e. g. Meltzer, Karthager,
i. 495; cf. Busolt, ii. 790 n.) see in this earlier war a mis-dating of
the great invasion by some writer anxious to deprive Gelo of all
excuse for refusing his aid to the mother-country, but if so, H. is
strangely careless. (3) Freeman (ii. 479), feeling it difficult to find
room for the war after Gelo became tyrant (i.e. after 491 B. C.), holds
that he refers to some fighting in which he took part as a subordinate 
of Cleandrus or Hippocrates, but this is surely an impossible
interpretation of Gelo's words. Most probably, Gelo and Thero
attempted to conquer the Carthaginian strongholds in Western
Sicily, Motye, Soloeis, and Panormus, with their Elymian ally
Segesta, <foreign rend="ital">circ.</foreign> 483 B. C., and so provoked the great Carthaginian
expedition of 480 B. C. (ch. 165 f.). It is true that Diodorus (xi. 1)
assigns <foreign rend="ital">three years</foreign> to the Carthaginian preparations, but these
are probably only an inference from Xerxes' three years of preparation 
(vii. 1).</p>

of opening the trade of the further West, and especially Spain
(i. 163; iv. 152), to Hellenic commerce and colonization, breaking
the Phoenician and Punic monopoly. He may have thought of a
great pan-Hellenic alliance to meet the Semite in the West, and
then the Persian in Eastern Greece.</p></div3>

light-armed troops and cavalry shows the higher level of military

oration (cf. <bibl n="Plut. Per. 8">Plut. Per. 8</bibl>, 28), probably that over those who fell in the
Samian war 440 B. C. (Meyer, F. ii, pp. 221, 222); cf. Ar. Rhet. iii. 10
and i. 7, 1365 b 31 <foreign lang="greek">οἷον Περικλῆς τὸν ἐπιτάφιον λέγων τὴν νεότητα ἐκ τῆς

took the figure from Pericles is rendered probable by the other
resemblances to funeral orations in this passage (cf. 157. 1 n.;
161. 3 n.). Even if the simile be older H. may well have been reminded 
of it by the striking application of it in Pericles' oration.
Here it is far less appropriate, as seems to have been felt by the
reader who appended the clumsy explanation which has since been
interpolated in the text. Gelo might, however, compare the youthful
vigour of the colony, Sicily, to the spring, and the effete mothercountry 
to the later duller months of the year.</p></div3></div>

<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">παρὰ Σαμίων</lemma>: the reading of the better MSS. must be adopted,
for if <foreign lang="greek">μετά</foreign> be read Cadmus is made to take a part in the treachery of
the Samians through which Scythes (presumably his own father)
lost his city and for a time his liberty (cf. vi. 23, 24 n.). But with
the reading <foreign lang="greek">παρά</foreign> an intelligible reconstruction is possible. Scythes,
leaving the lordship of Cos, bestowed on him by Darius, to his son
Cadmus, went to Sicily and made himself ruler of Zancle, becoming
apparently (<foreign rend="ital">circ.</foreign> 495 B. C.) a vassal of Hippocrates. In 494 B. C.
Samians (and some Milesians) came on his invitation to colonize
Kale Acte (vi. 22, 24; <bibl n="Thuc. 6.4">Thuc. vi. 4</bibl>), but on the suggestion of Anaxilas 
of Rhegium treacherously seized Zancle. Hippocrates, who
came as suzerain to aid Zancle, ended by selling it to the Samians.
Then Anaxilas, still hoping to make himself supreme in Zancle,
stirred up Cadmus to take the city from the Samians (for <foreign lang="greek">ἔσχε</foreign> cf.
v. 46. 2; vi. 23. 2, 36. 1, &amp;c.). Cadmus came from Cos with a number
of followers (among whom we are told by Suidas (<foreign rend="ital">s. v.</foreign>) was
Epicharmus as a baby in arms), and with the aid of Anaxilas recovered 
Zancle (<foreign rend="ital">circ.</foreign> 490 B. C.). He must, however, have been
a mere subordinate of the tyrant of Rhegium, since in all other
accounts Anaxilas alone is mentioned (Schol. <bibl n="Pind. P. 2">Pind. Pyth. ii. 34</bibl>;
Diod. xi. 48, 66); cf. especially <cit><bibl n="Thuc. 6.4">Thuc. vi. 4</bibl> <quote lang="greek">tou\s de\ *sami/ous *)anaci/las

fully confirmed by its coinage. Further, it would seem that Cadmus
must have been driven from Messene by Anaxilas before 481, otherwise 
he could hardly have been the trusted envoy of Gelo, the chief
foe of the Rhegine tyrant.</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">τὴν  μεταβαλοῦσαν</lemma>. The change of name apparently took place
when Anaxilas first put the Samians in possession of Zancle (494-493 
B. C.), not as Thucydides implies when he ejected them. This
seems proved by the fact that coins on the Euboic-Attic standard,
with a lion's head Samian in style on one side, and a calf's head on
the other, are inscribed with the word <foreign lang="greek">Μεσσηνίων</foreign> (Holm, G. S. iii,
p. 574; further, Hill, Hist. Greek Coins, 29-35, and C. H. Dodd in
J. H. S. xxviii. 56-76). These, which resemble closely the contemporary 
coins of Rhegium (Head, H. N. 108), must belong to the
<pb n="200"/>
time when Anaxilas was on friendly terms with the Samians, while
those with a running hare and the inscription <foreign lang="greek">Μεσσηνίων</foreign> on one side
and a mule-chariot on the other were introduced by Anaxilas from
Rhegium later (Holm, G. S. iii. 576). These types, according to
Aristotle (Jul. Pollux, v. 75), commemorated a victory at Olympia, and
the introduction of the hare into Sicily (Hill, <foreign rend="ital">op. cit.</foreign> p. 33).</p>
<p>Macan prefers the reading <foreign lang="greek">μετὰ Σαμίων</foreign>. He thus makes
Cadmus co-operate with the Samians in depriving his own father
of the lordship of Zancle. He suggests that there may have been
a deep laid plot between the father, the son, and Hippocrates,
Scythes being anxious to return to the Persian court and his
imprisonment at Inyx (vi. 23) a pretence. Hippocrates certainly
behaved strangely in making a bargain with the treacherous
Samians at the expense of Zancle (vi. 23), but there is not sufficient
evidence of the alleged plot. Subsequently on this supposition
Cadmus was driven out along with the Samians by Anaxilas, and
then found refuge with Gelo.</p></div>

of these two versions of the alliance can be traced back beyond the
fourth century, their divergence in language is rather in their favour
as suggesting an independent origin. Nor is the language of Ephorus
unsuitable. The great king would very probably treat the colonists
of his Phoenician subjects as though he were their sovereign, and
the Carthaginians might not care to dispute the form so long as
they secured the real advantages of an alliance. We cannot safely
argue from the silence of H. and Aristotle that they were ignorant
of any co-operation, much less that it did not exist in fact.
The enemies of the Greeks would naturally plan a simultaneous
attack, and in concerting their plans the Phoenicians would be
useful intermediaries. The alliance may then be accepted (with
Meltzer, Freeman, Busolt, E. Meyer, and Grundy) as against the
doubts of Duncker, Beloch, Hauvette, and Macan.</p>

<p>According to Diodorus (xi. 20 f.), Hamilcar, after losing through
a storm his cavalry and chariots on his voyage, landed at Panormus.
Thence he marched to Himera and, after a victory, besieged the
town, which was defended by Thero. Gelo coming to its aid with
50,000 foot and 5,000 horse, surprised and captured many
<pb n="202"/>
Carthaginian stragglers. Then hearing that Hamilcar expected a
force of cavalry from Selinus, he sent his own horsemen to personate
them. These troops slew Hamilcar at the beginning of the action,
while he was sacrificing, threw the Carthaginian army in the seacamp 
into confusion and set fire to the fleet. Meanwhile Gelo fell
on the main Punic army near the land-camp, and after a stubborn
fight slaughtered the enemy to the number of 150,000. This
account (given in detail by Grundy, pp. 422-5) is irreconcilable with
H. as to the time and manner of Hamilcar's death (cf. Freeman,
ii. 186-99, 518-22), and shows clear signs of rhetorical exaggerations
in the number of the slain and in the account of Gelo's stratagem,
which is compared with that of Themistocles. On the other hand,
the two camps and the burning of the fleet (cf. Polyaen. i. 27)
look like genuine local tradition. Probably Timaeus overlaid such
a tradition with his own rhetoric. The account is regarded as
untrustworthy by Meltzer, E. Meyer, Beloch, and Busolt, though

that a slave (or even a freedman) should add his father's name on
his offerings at Olympia (<foreign rend="ital">v. inf.</foreign>) and call Rhegium and Messana
his fatherland (Paus. <foreign rend="ital">l. c.</foreign>). Probably he was a low-born dependant
of Anaxilas (cf. Maeandrius, iii. 142). For <foreign lang="greek">ἐπίτροπος</foreign> cf. the case of

after Micythus had been regent nine years (476-467), his wards,
instigated by Hiero, demanded an account of his stewardship.
Through this, his honesty was so strikingly proved that they begged
him to keep on the administration, but Micythus, preferring to
retire, lived in honour at Tegea till his death. This is a little
inconsistent with H.'s <foreign lang="greek">ἐκπεσών</foreign>.</p>
<p>The offerings of Micythus at Olympia seen by Pausanias (v. 26)
were in three groups, comprising in all fifteen figures (besides some
removed by Nero) by Argive sculptors, Glaucus and Dionysius.
Fragments of pedestals have been found bearing inscriptions
restored by Roehl, I. G. A. 532, 533, and better by Kaibel (Hermes,
xxviii. 60), showing that the offerings were made for the recovery of
his son from sickness.</p>

that &lsquo;Thermopylae could not have been held without Artemisium,
for it would have been at once turned by the enemies&rsquo; fleet, but
also that Artemisium was useless without Thermopylae, for the
Persians would never have attacked the Greek fleet but simply
sailed past it outside Euboea, if the land road to the Isthmus had

<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">τῆς ἄλλης</lemma>. By an idiomatic compression the &lsquo;narrowest part&rsquo; is
included in the rest of the country with which it is really contrasted. 
Cf. Tac. Agr. 34 &lsquo;ceterorum Britannorum fugacissimi&rsquo; and
Milton's &lsquo;fairest of her daughters Eve&rsquo;. Though there is a verbal
contradiction in saying &lsquo;the pass through Trachis where narrowest
is fifty feet broad, yet this is not the narrowest point but before and
behind where it is only some six feet&rsquo;, the meaning is pretty clear.
Herodotus is first describing the best known and most defensible
part of the pass, &lsquo;the Middle Gate,&rsquo; near the Phocian wall (<foreign rend="ital">inf.</foreign>), and
the little hill where the last stand was made (ch. 225), which was
about fifty feet wide; and then inconsistently adds further statements
as to the western and eastern gates, in front of and behind the
pass proper, where there was in his day but just room for the road.</p>
<p>[Macan's suggestion that H. meant by <foreign lang="greek">ἡ διὰ Τρηχῖνος ἔσοδος</foreign> the
entirely different pass up the gorge of the Asopus into Doris (cf.
<ref target="c.8.31" targOrder="U">viii. 31 n.</ref>; vii. 199 n.) is impossible.]</p>
<p>H. here gives us in broad outline a general description, reserving
details for ch. 198-200, chapters which should be studied in connexion 
with this. But the main points are here. The pass between
mountain and sea has at either end an extremely narrow gate;
the western gate, however, near Anthela, could be easily turned by
crossing a projecting spur of the mountain, the eastern near Alpeni
(ch. 216) is clearly behind the Greek position. In the three miles
between them lay a double amphitheatre contracting about halfway 
at the Middle Gate; this is the true Thermopylae where are
the hot springs and the Phocian wall (cf. 241 n.). For a full description 
cf. Grundy, p. 284 f.</p></div3>
<div3 id="c.7.176.3" type="section" n="3">
<p>Clear and good as is this description in general, the direction of
the coast is wrongly given. H. evidently thought that the road
<pb n="208"/>
through the pass ran from north to south, since he here describes
various features on either side as lying east or west of it, and later
(ch. 199, 200. 1, 201 <foreign rend="ital">ad fin.</foreign>) speaks of points on the road as lying
north or south of each other. In reality the coast and road bend to
the east near Trachis. But the error is natural if, as appears likely
from the route-map given (ch. 198-200), and from the expression
&lsquo;before&rsquo; and &lsquo;behind&rsquo; Thermopylae (&sect; 2), H. visited Thermopylae
while on a journey from the north to Greece, since the road from
Lamia runs due north and south across the plain, and the bend in
the ancient road may have been more gradual than that in the
modern. Macan is surely wrong in doubting whether H. had been
at Thermopylae (cf. Grundy, Quart. Rev., vol. ccii, p. 136).</p>
<p>The head of the Maliac gulf has now receded about four miles, and
the pass itself is now separated from the sea by a tract of marshy
ground a mile or more in width formed of the alluvial deposits
brought down by the rivers and encircled by the precipitous sides of
Mount Oeta and Callidromus (cf. ch. 198; Strabo 428). Even now,
however, between the Asopus and the Middle Gate of Thermopylae
the ground to the left of the road is impassable marsh. For H.'s
sea and marsh cf. Liv. xxxvi. 18 &lsquo;loca usque ad mare invia palustri 
limo et voraginibus&rsquo;.</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">θερμὰ λουτρά</lemma>. The hot springs, which are copious and over
120&deg; F. in temperature, rise on the side of Callidromus, a great cliff
mounting almost sheer to a height of 3,000 ft. and on the edge of
a great fan-shaped mass of stream d&eacute;bris. The stream, which is
of a bright clear green (cf. <bibl n="Paus. 4.35.9">Paus. iv. 35. 9</bibl>), first enters the baths
and then turns two mills (cf. Grundy, p. 286).</p>

<p>Warm springs were usually <foreign lang="greek">Ἡράκλεια λουτρά</foreign> (Aristoph. Nub. 1051),

<p>The whole district was the scene of many incidents in the life of
Heracles and of his death (cf. ch. 193. 2, 198. 2, 216; and Sophocles,
Trachiniae).</p>
<p>For the wall cf. ch. 208, 223, 225.</p>
<p>The existing remains of wall foundations on the neck by which
the first mound is attached to the mountain side are believed by
Grundy (pp. 288, 289) to be relics of a wall identical, at least in site,
with the one which the Phocians built. It lies a little east of the
Middle Gate and of the springs. It seems clear that the Phocians
used the springs to channel (&sect; 4) the road in front, i. e. west of the
wall, and so to hinder the Thessalian cavalry.

<p>At this period Phocis no longer extended to the pass; the
Malians who dwelt west of it were dependents of Thessaly, and east
of the pass the Locrians dwelt (cf. 216. 1). But in old days the
Phocians may have reached the Spercheius, as the names Anticyra

<p>The voyage would seem to be 90-100 miles direct across the sea,
or, if we allow for coasting, perhaps 120 miles (Cl. R. xxiii. 186).
Such a distance would not be beyond the powers of a single ship on
a long summer's day, e. g. 15-16 hours. We are told that a trireme
could be <foreign rend="ital">rowed</foreign> from Byzantium to Heraclea (150 miles) in a long
day (? 18 <foreign rend="ital">or</foreign> 24 hours; <bibl n="Xen. Anab. 6.4.2">Xen. Anab. vi. 4. 2</bibl>), and the second Athenian
<pb n="211"/>
trireme sent to Mitylene must by extraordinary exertions have
accomplished the voyage of 210 miles in something like 24 hours
(<bibl n="Thuc. 3.49">Thuc. iii. 49</bibl>). Further, a merchant ship (<foreign lang="greek">ναῦς στρογγύλη</foreign>) could,
with an absolutely favourable wind, do some 150-160 miles in 24
hours, e.g. from Abdera to the mouth of the Ister (nearly 600 miles)
in four days and nights, i. e. a little more than 6 miles an hour (iv.
86; <bibl n="Thuc. 2.97">Thuc. ii. 97</bibl>). So, again, the voyage round Sicily (510 miles)
takes not much less than 8 days (<bibl n="Thuc. 6.1">Thuc. vi. 1</bibl>), while that from
Thasos to Amphipolis, or rather Eion (50 miles), is reckoned at half
a day's sail (<bibl n="Thuc. 4.104">Thuc. iv. 104</bibl>). These instances seem to prove that a
single merchantman could do 6 miles an hour and a warship something 
more, say 8 miles an hour. But single-ship voyages are no
evidence for fleets, since the pace of a fleet is that of its slowest
member. Now (<bibl n="Xen. Hell. 1.1.13">Xen. Hell. i. 1. 13</bibl>) Alcibiades took a whole autumn
night and up to <foreign lang="greek">ἄριστον</foreign> next morning (i. e. 16-18 hours) to sail with
86 ships from Parium to Proconnesus (not 35 miles), while Agathocles
(Diod. xx. 5) took 6 days and nights from Syracuse to Cape
Hermaeum (circ. 300 miles). Similarly, the voyages of Caesar's
fleet from Lilybaeum to Ruspina (Bell. Afr. 34) and from Utica
to Caralis (ch. 98) work out at 2 miles an hour or less, while those
of Scipio (Liv. xxix. 27) and of Caesar (Bell. Afr. 2) from Lilybaeum
to Africa, though regarded as quick and good voyages, work out
under 3 miles an hour. The Athenian fleet in Sicily sailed 36 miles
from Catana to Syracuse during the night (7-8 hours; <bibl n="Thuc. 6.65">Thuc. vi. 65</bibl>),
and Philip V's fleet of swift Illyrian lembi when panic-stricken fled
(Polyb. v. 110) from the mouth of the Achelous to Cephallenia
(circ. 180 miles) in about 36 hours; these fleets in a great hurry do
something like 5 miles an hour. It is true that Aemilius Paulus
states (Liv. xlv. 41) that he sailed from Brundisium to Corcyra in
9 Roman (i. e. 11 1/2 English) hours, and that if Corcyra be the town
this would mean 10 miles an hour, and if the nearest point of the
island 8 miles an hour; but this isolated and doubtful record time
does not justify us in ascribing so high a rate of speed to the
unwieldy Persian armada. Cf. Grundy and Tarn, Cl. Rev. xxiii.

<p>For a discussion of the numbers of Xerxes' army and fleet cf.
App. XIX. 2 f. Here we may remark that the moment chosen by
H. for his enumeration is appropriate. The great host had now
gathered to itself contingents from Europe, and had not yet suffered
loss either in storm or battle. The separation of the description of
the forces (ch. 61-99) from the estimate of their number indicates
that H. found no numbers in the official Persian lists (cf. ch. 60. 1, 61.
1 n.). For the number of the triremes he relied on tradition (ch. 89),
as also for that of the Asiatic land forces (ch. 60), but the enormously
exaggerated numbers of the forces from Europe rest on mere conjecture 
(185. 1 and 2); the over-estimate of the crews of the smaller
vessels (184. 3) is a rough guess from the supposed number of such
<pb n="212"/>
vessels, and the addition to the armed force of an equal number of
attendants (ch. 186) is a purely gratuitous assumption. H. is clearly
dominated by the popular belief (c. 228. 1) that Xerxes led three
million warriors against Greece. He makes no allowance for losses

<p>Tarn (J. H. S. xxviii. 212-15) regards the whole account of the
storm as a blend of two irreconcilable stories. In one, the Persian
fleet is rightly regarded as strung out along the little beaches of
Magnesia, and the loss fell chiefly on the supply-ships driven ashore
at many places from Meliboea to Cape Sepias (188. 3, 191. 1); in
the other, a poetical invention, Homer is closely imitated. The
whole fleet comes to a harbour too small for it, and is drawn up,
<foreign rend="ital">more Homerico</foreign> <foreign lang="greek">πρόκροσσαι</foreign>, and defended with a bulwark (<foreign lang="greek">ἕρκος</foreign>)
of wreckage (188. 1, 191. 1). Further, the losses are greatly exaggerated.

Pagasaean gulf (Iolcus). In Boeotia, 2 1/2 miles from Coronea,
stood the shrine and statue of Zeus Laphystius, where legend
said Phrixus had been saved by a ram from being sacrificed
(<bibl n="Paus. 9.34">Paus. ix. 34</bibl>). Mount Laphystius stood over against Orchomenus,
and on the opposite (eastern) side of Lake Copais there was, near
Acraephia (viii. 135. 1 n.), a <foreign lang="greek">πεδίον Ἀθαμάντιον</foreign> (<bibl n="Paus. 9.24.3">Paus. ix. 24. 3</bibl>), while
Mount Ptoon was named after Ptous son of Athamas (<bibl n="Paus. 9.23.6">Paus. ix.

<bibl n="Paus. 4.31.7">Paus. iv. 31. 7</bibl>; vii. 18. 12. Human sacrifices were regarded by the
Greeks as impious and only practised by barbarians (cf. iv. 103); so
pseudo-Plato, Minos 315 B-D <foreign lang="greek">ἡμῖν μὲν οὐ νόμος ἐστὶν ἀνθρώπους
θύειν ἀλλ’ ἀνόσιον, Καρχηδόνιοι δὲ θύουσιν ὡς ὅσιον καὶ νόμιμον αὐτοῖς,
καὶ ταῦτα ἔνιοι αὐτῶν καὶ τοὺς αὑτῶν υἱεῖς τῷ Κρόνῳ</foreign>. Plato, however,
admits as exceptions &lsquo;the sons of Athamas&rsquo; and the worshippers
of Zeus Lycaeus in Arcadia; cf. <bibl n="Paus. 8.38.7">Paus. viii. 38. 7</bibl>. At Orchomenus
in Boeotia the priest of Dionysus Laphystius every year at the
festival of the Agrionia pursued the young women of Minyan descent,
known as Oleae, with a drawn sword, and within Plutarch's memory
had slain one (Plut. Mor. 299 F; Quaest. Gr. 38). Again in Chios
and Tenedos in early times a man was torn in pieces as a sacrifice
to Dionysus Omestes (Porph. de Abstin. ii. 55), and for Attica cf.
&sect; 3 n. Human sacrifices were frequent among the Carthaginians
(cf. ch. 167 n.; Plato, <foreign rend="ital">l. c.</foreign>). The burning of their children in honour
of Baal and Moloch was common among the Canaanites (Deut. xii.
31; xviii. 9, 10), and the Israelites frequently relapsed into the
abominable practice (2 Kings xvii. 17; Jer. vii. 31; xix. 5; xxxii.
35). The kings themselves, Manasseh and Ahaz, made their
children pass through the fire in the valley of Hinnom (2 Chron.
xxviii. 3; xxxiii. 6), while the king of Moab when hard pressed &lsquo;took
his eldest son and offered him for a burnt-offering (2 Kings iii. 27).
Frazer (Golden Bough, pt. iii (the dying God), ch.6), argues from
this and from Micah vi. 6, 7; Ezek. xx. 26, 31, as well as from the
consecration of the firstborn among the Israelites (Exod. xiii. 1, 12;
xxxiv. 19) and the feast of the Passover, that the Semitic custom was
to sacrifice the firstborn as here, but that the custom was mitigated
by the permission to redeem the child (Numb. xviii. 15; iii. 44 f.),
or by the vicarious sacrifice of a lamb (cf. also Gen. xxii. 1-13).
In the legend here the ram that saved Phrixus points to the substitution 
of a ram for the human victim. So at Salamis in Cyprus an
<pb n="219"/>
ox took the place of a man, and at Syrian Laodicea a deer that of
a maiden (Porphyry, de Abstin. ii. 54-6). At Potniae goats were
substituted for boys (<bibl n="Paus. 9.8.2">Paus. ix. 8. 2</bibl>), and in a sacrifice to Munychian
Artemis for a girl. But the man rescued must henceforth be treated as
under God's ban and flee from his home; cf. the Italic <foreign rend="ital">ver sacrum</foreign>
Festus, p. 158, and especially 379. The legend here is an explanation 
of the ancient ceremony, and an attempt to find a reason for
an abhorrent worship in the wickedness of men (cf. <foreign rend="ital">inf.</foreign>).</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">Φρίξῳ</lemma>. Apparently his sister Helle was unknown in the earliest

a famine in the land; she then bribed the messenger sent to
inquire of the Delphic oracle to say that the children of Nephele,
the first wife of Athamas, must be sacrificed; but they were saved
by the ram with the golden fleece who bore Phrixus to Colchis
(Apollodorus, i. 9. 1).</p>

entering the town hall, was shut up there till the &lt;*&gt;east of the god

as a rule allowed to escape and a ram sacrificed in his stead.

this local legend is himself about to be offered, and so Sophocles in

his <foreign lang="greek">Ἀθάμας στεφανήφορος</foreign> represented him as led to the altar, a victim
to the vengeance of Nephele, but saved by Heracles (Schol. Arist.

suffer not for his wrongful treatment of Phrixus (a motive apparently
borrowed by Sophocles from the Epic poets), but for a famine or
plague due to the wrath of Zeus with the whole house, since he is
saved by the son of Phrixus, Cytisorus, who thus brings down the
wrath of heaven on himself and his posterity. This return of
Cytisorus is an expedient necessary in this form of the myth to
make Athamas, who had lost all his children, the ancestor of the
race. In the ordinary form of the legend, Athamas after the escape
of Phrixus goes mad, shoots one son Learchus, and forces Ino to

Spartan was attended by one Helot. But it is unlikely that the
4,000 Peloponnesians of the epigram (vii. 228. 1) are to be made
up by adding Helots, whom neither the inscription nor the historian

Lacedaemonians, a number given also by Isocrates (Paneg. 90;

administered the Delphic temple, met twice a year, in spring and
autumn, at Thermopylae and Delphi (<bibl n="Hyp. 6.8">Hyperides, Epitaph. 8</bibl>; <bibl n="Aeschin. 3.126">Aesch.
in Ctes. &sect; 126</bibl>; Strabo 420). The Pylagorae seem to have been
replaced after 280 B. C. by <foreign lang="greek">ἀγορατροί</foreign> (C. I. A. ii. 551). That
Thermopylae was the original meeting-place is shown by the names
Pylagorae, Pylaea, which are applied to the deputies' meetings
at both places, and by the existence of a shrine there to the
eponymous hero Amphictyon (ch. 200 <foreign rend="ital">ad fin.</foreign>). It is also confirmed
by the geographical position of the twelve &lsquo;surrounding&rsquo; (<foreign lang="greek">Ἀμφικτίονες</foreign> 
= <foreign lang="greek">περικτίονες</foreign>) tribes who belonged to the Amphictyony. To
the incomplete list in Herodotus (vii. 132. 1 n.) we may add from
Aeschines (<bibl n="Aeschin. 2.116">de Fals. Leg. 116</bibl>) Dorians, Ionians, Phocians (cf. <bibl n="Paus. 10.8.2">Paus.

<pb n="225"/>
were primarily concerned with religion, the treachery of Ephialtes
may have been regarded as an offence against the gods; it may,
however, be the earliest instance of Amphictyonic intervention in
politics, later so ruinous. A meeting may possibly have been held
immediately after the battle of Plataea (Bukatios, August-Sept.)
479 B. C., but the spring meeting of 478 B. C. is probably the one

should not be pressed (as by Grundy, p. 299), favour that assumption. 
If so, Trachis must have been previously captured by the
Persians (cf. ch. 203. 2 n.). But Pausanias (x. 22. 8) gives a different
account: <foreign lang="greek">ἀτραπός ἐστι διὰ τοῦ ὄρους τῆς Οἴτης, μία μὲν ἡ ὑπὲρ Τραχῖνος</foreign>

above Trachis&rsquo; Munro (J. H. S. xxii. 313) recognizes the original of
the modern high road. But the other was the path by which
Hydarnes, and afterwards Brennus, turned Thermopylae (<bibl n="Paus. 10.22.1">Paus. x.
22. 1</bibl> and 8). It was easier for an army and led through the
territory of the Aenianes, i. e. round the western end of the
Trachinian cliffs. Presumably it passed behind Trachis and
connected with the Anopaea path in the valley of the Asopus above
the gorge. The expression <foreign lang="greek">τὸν Ἀσωπὸν διαβάντες</foreign> (ch. 217. 1) in
Herodotus distinctly supports Pausanias' view given above, which is
adopted by Munro (<foreign rend="ital">l. c.</foreign>). Munro explains his views on the path

of the hero tanned with exposure, and recognized in him the

amused at their droll way of telling this tale released them. The

If he went right up the Asopus ravine, the heights held by the

Pausanias' &lsquo;steep path&rsquo; (ch. 216 n.) as well as the Anopaea. He would
therefore post them near the intersection of these paths, not far from
the monastery Panagia. He holds that this is confirmed by the large
number of oaks (ch. 218) in the forest just above it (Grundy, p. 302).</p></div3></div>

<p>The Phocian apology given by H. is but a lame one. At best
they allowed themselves to be surprised and retired in confusion,
leaving the way clear for Hydarnes. &lsquo;At worst they bartered away
the safety of Hellas and the lives of their allies for the security of
Delphi and its treasures&rsquo; (Munro). H., here perhaps inspired by
Delphi, does his best for them; he parades their spirited reply to
the Thessalians, and their resistance in the fastnesses of Parnassus

<p>Doubtless H. regarded the epitaph (ch. 228. 3) as good evidence of
the constancy of Megistias, in face of his own prediction of disaster.
The idea that he might have escaped is confirmed by the escape of
his son. But the incident is slender evidence for the inference drawn
by H., that all who retreated did so by the king's orders (cf. <foreign rend="ital">inf.</foreign>).</p>
<p>It is clear that H. in these chapters aims at excusing the allies for
deserting Leonidas by explaining that his death was fated by heaven
and foretold by the oracle. This official explanation that Leonidas,
like Decius Mus (Livy viii. 10; x. 28), devoted himself to save his
country, was designed to make his defeat and death an omen of
future victory. At the same time it was a convenient excuse for all
concerned, for the Athenians who had urged pushing forward the
line of defence to Artemisium and Thermopylae, for the Spartans
who had sent but inadequate support to their heroic king, and for
the Peloponnesian allies who had failed him in the hour of trial.
But the oracle is plainly a <foreign rend="ital">vaticinium post eventum.</foreign> It is inconsistent 
with the account of Leonidas' expedition previously given
(ch. 202-7; for even 205. 2, <foreign lang="greek">καὶ τοῖσι ἐτύγχανον παῖδες ἐόντες</foreign>, if not
a later adscript (cf. J. H. S. xxii. 316 n.), only implies danger not
self-immolation): it assigns no reason for the resolve of the Thespians 
to share his doom, and false or inadequate reasons for the
Thebans' action, and even for that of Leonidas himself, since it was
no disgrace for a Spartan commander to retreat when sound
strategy demanded it (cf. Eurybiades, Pausanias), although perhaps
his bodyguard were bound to remain with him to the last (cf.
Munro, J. H. S. xxii. 317). Diodorus (xi. 4) carries out consistently
the view here indicated in the oracle, but this completion of a process 
begun in H. shows us that the explanation is an afterthought
gradually perfected by later ages.</p></div>

<p>Grundy (<foreign rend="ital">op. cit.</foreign> 306-9, 315-17; improving on a suggestion made
by Bury in the Annual of the British School of Athens, ii. 102) argues
strongly that the 2,800 allies dismissed were really detached to meet
Hydarnes on the Anopaea, but failed to perform this duty. His
great point is that otherwise the conduct of the Thespians (and of
the Thebans) is inexplicable; cf. App. XX. 10, and for another
suggestion Munro, J. H. S. xxii. 317-19.</p>

(x. 20. 2), who adds the Mycenaeans.
<pb n="229"/></p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ἐν ὁμήρων λόγῳ</lemma>. Plutarch (de Malign. Her. 31, Mor. 865) rightly
attacks the view that the Thebans could have been detained as
hostages, a course which would only have added to Leonidas' own
danger. Further, Plutarch here makes an effective apology for his
countrymen; he urges that they sent 500 men under Mnamias to
Tempe and the contingent demanded by Leonidas to Thermopylae,
treating Leonidas with special honour. And with reference to the
tradition that Leontiades and the other Theban captives were
branded by Xerxes, Plutarch remarks (1) that Anaxandrus and not
Leontiades was in command, (2) that branding would be a proof
not of Medism but of fidelity to the Greek cause, (3) that the story
was unknown before H. On the whole, in spite of Grundy's doubts
(pp. 294-6) and Hauvette's rather half-hearted defence of H.
(Herodote, pp. 360-4), we must admit that H. has been misled by
malignant Athenian gossip, and that Leontiades, like Adeimantus,
has suffered for the sins of his son (vii. 233 n.; Introd. &sect; 30 <foreign rend="ital">c</foreign>, <foreign rend="ital">d</foreign>;
J. H. S. xxii. 317). E. Meyer (F. ii. 211) holds the Thebans remained
in order to desert with more effect, but it may well be that the Medizing
oligarchy at Thebes furnished as their contingent men of the
opposite party (Diod. xi. 4 <foreign lang="greek">τῆς ἑτέρας μερίδος</foreign>) loyal to the Greek
cause. The existence of such a party at Thebes seems proved (in
spite of H. ix. 87) by the Theban orator's speech against Plataea
(<bibl n="Thuc. 3.62">Thuc. iii. 62</bibl>). For the dispatch of political opponents to the front
to get rid of them, we may compare the attempt of the Corcyrean
democrats to enlist their opponents for naval service (<bibl n="Thuc. 3.75">Thuc. iii. 75</bibl>),
the sending of 300 oligarchic knights to Thibron by the restored
Athenian democrats (<bibl n="Xen. Hell. 3.1.4">Xen. Hell. iii. 1. 4</bibl>), and of oligarchs to Cambyses 
by Polycrates (H. iii. 44. 2 n.). Boeotian loyalists were doomed if
Thermopylae was lost, and so would be likely to fight to the last.

<p>Thucydides (ii. 2-6) gives us a fuller and more correct account
of the Theban surprise of Plataea in the spring of 431 B. C. (March
or April). He corrects H. on the following points. (1) The number
of the Thebans was not 400, but rather more than 300, of whom 180
were taken captive and executed. (2) Eurymachus was not in
command (though he planned the coup) but two Boeotarchs,
Pythangelus and Diemporus. For the animus of this passage cf.

394 B. C. (<bibl n="Xen. Hell. 4.2.16">Xen. Hell. iv. 2. 16</bibl>), Spartiates and Perioeci together

<p>The whole chapter is with reason regarded as an interpolation by
Kr&uuml;ger, followed by Abicht, Gomperz, Van Herwerden, and Macan.
There is no proper transition to Bk. VIII, a fact which leads Stein
to suspect an omission in the text. The formula introducing the
<pb n="234"/>
digression is strange, but as Macan points out, this anecdote is not
intended to be a resumption of the main thread of the story but to
supply an omission, and the words mean &lsquo;I will here return to
a place in the story where before I was guilty of an omission&rsquo;.
The author is excusing himself for putting in the story here, where
the only ground for its appearance is its connexion with Demaratus,
instead of in ch. 220, where it was required to explain how the
Spartans had early information of the intended Persian invasion.
Kr&uuml;ger also regards as suspicious the postponement of the actual
story in favour of a disquisition on Demaratus' motives and the
author's assertion that the motive was ill-will, and subsequent
willingness to leave it an open question. Such hesitation, however,
may be easily paralleled from the genuine work of H. (cf. ii. 123. 1;
v. 45. 2). Kr&uuml;ger's arguments from language are stronger. The
asyndeton <foreign lang="greek">ἐπύθοντο</foreign> is intolerable, <foreign lang="greek">τὸ ἐς Δελφοὺς χρηστήριον</foreign> is
hardly justified by (ii. 150) <foreign lang="greek">τὴν Σύρτιν τὴν ἐς Λιβύην; δελτίον δίπτυχον</foreign>
is queer Greek, as <foreign lang="greek">δίπτυχα</foreign> in this sense is late, and elsewhere H.
uses <foreign lang="greek">δέλτος</foreign> (viii. 135); <foreign lang="greek">ἐπέτηξε</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">ἐκκνᾶν</foreign> do not reappear till Aen.
Tact. ch. 31, nor <foreign lang="greek">συμμάχεται</foreign> (middle) till Xenophon, or <foreign lang="greek">ὁδοφύλαξ</foreign>
till Eustathius. It may be said that some of these strange words
are quoted by Pollux (Onom. x. 58) from H., and that the story,
though without names, goes back at least to (350 B. C.) Aeneas Tacticus 
(<foreign rend="ital">l. c.</foreign>), but these stylistic peculiarities and late words surely betray
a forger. The existence of an anonymous version of the story in
Aeneas, and a variant in Trogus Pompeius (Justin, ii. 10. 12-17),
in which &lsquo;a sister of Leonidas&rsquo; figures, and Demaratus' motive is
patriotic, really discredit the story, as suggesting that the narrative
as here given is a gradual and relatively late fabrication (Macan).
It is inferior to the similar stories of Harpagus (i. 123. 3, 4) and
Histiaeus (v. 35) on which it may have been modelled. Finally,
the extremely unfavourable impression given of Demaratus seems
un-Herodotean. It appears highly probable that some part of
the text connecting Books VII and VIII was early lost, and into
the gap this chapter was thrust by an interpolator. Even if it be
a genuine fragment it is misplaced here.</p></div></div>

the double position (vii. 175-7) supplemented by a more detailed
topography of Thermopylae (vii. 198-201), secondly the story of the
movements of the fleets (vii. 179-95) and a brief account of the
march of Xerxes' army (vii. 196-7), finally a narrative of the struggle
at Thermopylae (vii. 202-33) and of the contemporary (ch. 15) seafights 
at Artemisium (viii. 1-23). Yet, as it stands, the opening of
Book VIII is abrupt and not connected with the end of Book VII.
Probably the connexion and implied contrast between the land and
sea forces has been obscured by the later insertion of ch. 234-9
(Macan).</p>
<p>The summary of the Greek forces here given is parallel to that
prefixed to the fighting at Thermopylae (vii. 202). Similar lists
are given of the Greek fleets before Lade (vi. 8 n.) and before
Salamis (viii. 43 f.), and of the Greek army before Plataea (ix. 28).
But whereas at Plataea H. follows the line of battle from right to
left (as at Lade from east to west), and at Salamis adopts a geographical 
order (Peloponnese, northern Greece, islands, &amp;c.), here
he arranges the states according to the number of ships furnished
(ch. 2. 1), thus incidentally justifying the claim of Athens to command

<p>The traditional position of Sparta made the Greeks (especially
the Peloponnesians who formed the kernel of the league, though
only furnishing 113 ships) willing to accept her leadership, when
they would follow no other state. That Athens made some claim
to naval leadership and withdrew in face of the opposition of the
allies, is highly probable. Yet the assumption that it was natural
<pb n="236"/>
that Athens should lead at sea and Sparta on land (vii. 157 n., 161 n.)
belongs to the years after 478 B. C. The magnanimity of Athens
in yielding up the command is lauded by Isocrates (Paneg. 72),
Lycurgus (in Leoc. 70), Aristides (Panath. i. 217, Dind.); it is
ascribed to the wise advice of Themistocles (<bibl n="Plut. Them. 7">Plut. Them. 7</bibl>). The
claims of Athens were asserted later by her orators, especially in the
funeral orations in the Ceramicus, of which we have echoes in vii.

is the master of craft and wiles (ch. 110, 124), Aristides the true

found in the improbability of the Euboeans squandering so large
a sum as thirty talents on a subordinate when they might have
bought the commander-in-chief cheap (five talents) (cf. Bauer,
Them. p. 25); in the fact that Adimantus, who is supposed to have
been bribed by Themistocles, continues to be his chief opponent

<p>For Thessalian enmity to Phocis cf. vii. 176. 4, and for Thessalian

in their cities; these the Phocians slew when they revolted. The
Thessalians in revenge stoned 250 Phocian hostages and then invaded 
Phocis through Locris.</p>
<p>Pausanias (x. 1) makes the war begin with (1) the disaster to the
Thessalian cavalry described in ch. 28, and end with the stratagem
of Tellias given here (4). Between the two he inserts (2) the
destruction of a picked Phocian force of 300 by the Thessalian
horse, and (3) a desperate resolve of the Phocians to conquer or to
die themselves, and to devote their wives and families to the flames,
which leads up to a brilliant victory (cf. Plut. Mor. 244). Though
Pausanias is a little confused, these stories seem to belong to this
war, and not to an earlier struggle before 570 B. C., when the

<p>H. writes as if the whole Persian army used this road through
the Asopus ravine (vii. 199 n.), which, &lsquo;after winding through the
mountains some three and a half miles, suddenly broadens out into
a wide upland valley behind the range of Oeta, from which there is
a long but not difficult passage to the Dorian plain (Grundy, p. 261).</p>
<p>[Probably this approach from Malis is the &lsquo;narrow strip&rsquo; of
Doris.] Thence this route, which entirely avoids Thermopylae,
passes along the valleys of the Pindus and the Cephisus to Phocis
and Boeotia.</p>
<p>But it may be deemed certain that Xerxes also used the
coast-road through Thermopylae, which turns inland near Atalanta
in Locris and reaches Parapotamii by Hyampolis (ch. 28). This is
the only route suitable for a force of cavalry and a large baggage
train. It would take the invaders to Hyampolis and Abae (ch. 33),
which lie off the Doris route, the only one mentioned by H. Pro<pb n="244"/>
bably he regarded the use of the main coast-road as an obvious
sequel of the capture of Thermopylae, which need not be explicitly

perpendicular cliffs with peaked summits (Phaedriades; cf. Diod.
xvi. 28), the eastern being called Hyampeia, the western Nauplia.</p>
<p>H.'s account of the deliverance of Delphi is obviously a temple
legend told the author by the Delphic priests (cf. 35. 2, 39. 1, 2),
who would also have furnished the inscription recorded by Diodorus
(xi. 14). That the legend was widely accepted is shown by its
repetition with minor variations when the Gaul attacked Delphi,
279 B. C. (<bibl n="Paus. 10.23">Paus. x. 23</bibl>). The stories in Ctesias (Pers. 25, 27, p. 70) of
an attempted sack by Mardonius who fell there (after Plataea but
while Xerxes is marching to Athens) and of actual spoliation by the
eunuch Matacas dispatched by Xerxes after his return to Sardis
deserve no credit. Even H.'s story is open to grave suspicions.
The oracle had certainly shown strong signs of favouring the Mede
(cf. vii. 140, 148, 169), and the bulk of the tribes forming the Delphic
Amphictyony (cf. <ref target="c.7.132" targOrder="U">vii. 132 n.</ref>) had now joined Xerxes; it would
therefore be impolitic (cf. Meyer, iii. p. 384) for the Persians to
plunder Delphi. This fact they seem themselves to recognize
though perhaps not till a year later (ix. 42). The certain fact seems
to be that the Persians could have plundered Delphi and did not
do so; tradition strongly supports the view that a Persian force
marched on Delphi. Three interpretations have been given of this
difficult problem.</p>
<p>1. Xerxes, seeing that Delphi, tempted perhaps by the promised
tithe (vii. 132), wavered (cf. the encouragement to the Greeks vii.
178, 189), and the second answer to Athens (vii. 141-3), sent a detachment 
to take it, which was repulsed on the difficult mountain-road by
the Phocians aided by a storm and some manifestations held to be
supernatural. Since the priests forbade any defence (cf. 36) and
Delphi was an open town, Xerxes might have sent quite a small
force expecting no resistance (Duncker vii. 276 n.; Grundy, pp. 349,
<pb n="247"/>
350). Afterwards the Persians saw how impolitic any attack on
Delphi was.</p>
<p>2. The Persians who attacked Delphi were a mere hand of
disorderly plunderers acting without orders (Pomtow, Jahr. kl. Philol.
cxxix. 227 f.). This is, however, opposed to H.'s statement, ch. 34, 35.</p>
<p>3. The force was sent to protect Delphi from casual plunderers
(Munro, J. H. S. xxii. 320), but was perhaps harassed by Phocian
zealots from Mount Parnassus.</p>
<p>This view assumes that Delphi had come to a definite agreement
with Xerxes (Curtius, Wecklein, Meyer), and afterwards put out
the legend to cloak its Medism. Casson (C.R. xxviii. 145-51, xxxv. 144)
suggests that Xerxes sent a force to Delphi to make an inventory of
the temple treasures.</p></div>

one would have contemplated a pitched battle in Boeotia with
Xerxes (cf. App. XX, &sect; 2). The Spartans had no doubt promised that
Attica should be defended, but they meant to fulfil their promise at
Thermopylae and not on Mount Cithaeron. And whatever the
&lsquo;man in the street&rsquo; at Athens may have expected, the leaders must
have known that resistance in Boeotia was out of the question, and

and (Philoch. fr. 33; F. H. G. i. 389; Strab. 383) gained the
victory for the Athenians in the war between Erechtheus (his grandfather) 
and Eumolpus of Eleusis. The accepted tradition represented
him as of foreign origin, the son of Xuthus or Apollo and Creusa
daughter of Erechtheus, and king of the Aegialees (v. 68. 2; vii.
94). Yet his sons give their names to the four old Attic (Ionic)
tribes (v. 66. 2 n.). Clearly Ion played too important a part in old
Attic mythology to be altogether ignored, but he could not be fitted
into the received genealogy of the Attic kings, which ran in unbroken
line from Cecrops to Theseus. Hence his ambiguous position
(Strabo, Pausanias, <foreign rend="ital">l.c.</foreign>) and foreign origin, which is strongly affirmed
by Euripides.</p></div3></div>

<p>H.'s description of this way up as in front of the Acropolis
but behind the gates has caused some confusion (e. g. Leake, Top.
Athens, p. 264, thinks it implies that H. regarded the north side as
the front). The entrance, however, to the subterranean passage
(cf. <foreign rend="ital">inf.</foreign>) faces west, the same direction as the main entrance (<foreign lang="greek">πύλαι</foreign>),
and is about seventy yards to the rear of it (<foreign lang="greek">ὄπισθε</foreign>). Thus H.'s
description is both accurate and obvious (E. Gardner, Ancient
Athens, p. 47 ff.).</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ἀνέβησαν  κατὰ τὸ ἱρόν</lemma>. Pausanias (i. 18. 2) repeats this, adding
the myth of Aglauros (Agraulos) and her sisters who opened the chest
in which Erichthonius was hidden (cf. ch. 41. 2 n.) and then cast themselves 
down from the rocks above the precinct of Aglauros. &lsquo;It has
generally been supposed that the escalading party either climbed up
in the open, where they could hardly have escaped notice, or else
ascended by the direct but narrow staircase that may still be seen
above the grotto of Aglauros; but so obvious a way if not strongly
barricaded, could hardly have been left unguarded. Recent excavations 
have shown a much more likely route. A natural cleft in the
rock runs under or within the northern wall of the Acropolis; its
western entrance is in the projecting face of rock just to the west of
the cave of Aglauros; it has also an outlet at the eastern end, nearly
opposite the west end of the Erechtheum. Where this cleft is within
the wall of the Acropolis, it has an opening at the top which gives
access to the plateau above it; but there is a sheer drop of about
twenty feet, which might well lead the defenders to regard it as
needing no guard; and an attacking party, once within the cleft,
could ascend at their leisure with scaling ladders or ropes&rsquo;
(E. Gardner, <foreign rend="ital">l. c.</foreign>).</p>
<p>Bury (Cl. Rev. x. (1896) p. 416) argues that the defence of the
Acropolis was undertaken by a regular garrison at the command of
the Athenian generals. He lays stress on the length of the defence
(<foreign lang="greek">συχνὸν χρόνον</foreign>, 52 <foreign rend="ital">ad fin.</foreign>), reckoned by Busolt (ii. 695) at about
a fortnight, on the desirability of satisfying both the rival interpretations 
of the wooden wall (c. 51 2; vii. 142), and above all on the
consternation caused at Salamis by the capture of the Acropolis
(ch. 56).</p>
<p>Munro (J. H. S. xxii. 321) accepts this view, though he admits
that a fortnight's siege is hard to reconcile with the movements of
the Persian fleet (ch. 66, 70), and the regular occupation of the
Acropolis inconsistent with the decree recorded in Plutarch (Them.
10), <foreign lang="greek">τοὺς δ’ ἐν ἡλικίᾳ πάντας ἐμβαίνειν ἐς τὰς τριήρεις</foreign>: cf. <cit><bibl n="Thuc. 1.73">Thuc. i. 73</bibl>
<quote lang="greek">e)sba/ntes e)sta\s nau=s pandhmei/</quote></cit>, Aristides, ii. p. 256 (Dind.). Moreover, the
terror in the Greek fleet may be discounted as prevailing among the
Peloponnesians always anxious to retreat to the Isthmus, and the
<foreign lang="greek">συχνὸς χρόνος</foreign> may only mean a long time under the circumstances
(cf. Grundy, <foreign rend="ital">op. cit.</foreign> 358, 359); so it seems better to accept H.'s
account. Ctesias (&sect; 26, p. 70), who otherwise agrees with H., makes

the defenders escape by night, a suggestion uncritically accepted

and Themistocles was a leading instance (Bauer, Them. p. 72). We
may see the result of this in Plutarch, who by silence (Them.) or
explicitly (de Mal. <foreign rend="ital">l.c.</foreign>) rejects the intervention of Mnesiphilus on
this occasion, and yet retains him as the pupil of Solon and teacher
of Themistocles in politics (Them. 2; Moral. 154, 795 C). The

of the same name half-way between Sybaris and Tarentum. Apparently 
it was colonized from Colophon and imitated Sybaris in
wealth and luxury (Athen. 523). Probably it also resembled Sybaris
in the possession of an overland trade, since we find alliance coins
with the names of Siris and Pyxus on them (Hill, G. and R. C.,
p. 104). It is said to have been conquered by its Achaean neighbours,
Sybaris, Croton, and Metapontum (before 510 B. C., Justin xx. 2; cf.
Pais, Ancient Italy, pp. 67-86). Later, after 440, Siris was refounded
by Thurii and Tarentum jointly, though accounted a Tarentine
colony. Finally, 433-431 B. C., most of its inhabitants removed to
Heraclea, Siris remaining the port of that colony.</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ἡμετέρη  ἐκ παλαιοῦ</lemma>. The claims of Athens to Siris seem
shadowy, resting only on her headship of the Ionic race. But that
the idea of westward expansion, afterwards so popular at Athens, had
<pb n="256"/>
occurred to Themistocles is suggested by the names of his daughters
Italia and Sybaris (<bibl n="Plut. Them. 32">Plut. Them. 32</bibl>), by his supposed relations with
Hiero (<bibl n="Plut. Them. 24">Plut. Them. 24</bibl>, 25), if they be not fictions of Stesimbrotus
and Theophrastus (Schaefer, Philol. xviii. 187), and by his interest
in Corcyra (<bibl n="Plut. Them. 24">Plut. Them. 24</bibl>; <bibl n="Thuc. 1.136">Thuc. i. 136</bibl>). It is, however, possible
that Themistocles, following the oracle, only threatened westward
emigration vaguely, and that the precise spot was fixed on later,
when Athenian interest had become centred on New Sybaris
(450 B. C.) and Thurii (445 B. C.). At that time there would be many
old oracles, real or spurious, encouraging colonization there. The
idea of emigration <foreign rend="ital">en masse</foreign> had been mooted more than once in

<p>The Eleusinian plain lies south-west of Mount Parnes, being
divided from the Attic plain by Mount Poikilon and Daphni, and
bounded on the north and west by Cithaeron and the highlands of
Megara. It is called Thriasian (ix. 7. <foreign lang="greek">β</foreign> 2; <bibl n="Thuc. 1.114">Thuc. i. 114</bibl>, ii. 19-21)
from the important deme of Thria, which lay probably at Kalyvia,
three miles east-north-east of Eleusis. The regular route from
Thebes, by which the Persian infantry would naturally come, led to
the Thriasian plain a little north of Eleusis. Plutarch (Them. 15)
puts this vision on the day of the battle, which would thus be on
the 20th Boedromion (Plut. Phocion 28, Camill. 19). It is, however, 
evident that Plutarch derived all the details of his account,
except &lsquo;a great light that shone from Eleusis&rsquo;, from H., and that
the historian believed that Dicaeus saw the portent at least a day,
and perhaps several days, before the battle. Busolt (ii. 703-4)
argues that the battle took place a few days after the 20th Boedromion 
(= Sept. 22) and some days before the eclipse (Oct. 2, 480),

taking him to refer not to ships or crews, but solely to fighting
men, including marines. For the fleet the idea of compensation is
absurd. H. has reckoned the loss from storms (vii. 190; viii. 13)

perhaps a hundred more (vii. 194; viii. 11, 14, 16), thus reducing

the aboriginal population, but there seems no special reason for
holding them to be Ionic. H. here as elsewhere (cf. i. 56) makes
Ionians a branch of Pelasgi.</p>
<p>Apparently the town Orneae (about thirteen miles north-west of
Argos) was reduced by Argos to a status similar to that of the Laconian 
Perioecic towns under Sparta. Hence all the other Perioeci of
Argos were termed Orneatae; cf. the Caerites at Rome. Stein holds
that <foreign lang="greek">καὶ περίοικοι</foreign> is an adscript, on the grounds that Cynuria had
belonged to Sparta at least since about 550 B. C. (i. 82; <bibl n="Thuc. 5.41">Thuc. v.
41</bibl>), and that the Argive Perioeci, some of whom are said to have
been enfranchised (<bibl n="Aristot. Pol. 5.1303a">Ar. Pol. 1303 a 8</bibl>), and who were all, including
the Orneatae (<bibl n="Thuc. 5.67">Thuc. v. 67</bibl>), treated as <foreign lang="greek">σύμμαχοι</foreign> (<bibl n="Thuc. 5.47">Thuc. v. 47</bibl>, 77),

<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">Κέον  καὶ  Κυνόσουραν</lemma>. These names cause a difficulty. They
seem to be taken from the oracle of Bacis (ch. 77). That oracle may
well have had reference originally not to Salamis but to Artemisium;
if so, Ceos would be the well-known island, Cynosura the promontory 
near Marathon, and the temple of Artemis that at Brauron
(cf. Munro, J. H. S. xxii. 306 n.). Afterwards the prophecy was
applied to Salamis and the temple of Artemis identified with that
at Munychia. Blakesley, following Larcher, believes that H. intends
to describe the closing up of Persian squadrons from these distant
points, but the nearest of them, Ceos, is forty miles off Salamis,
while Cynosura is sixty miles away, so that the supposed movement
is impossible. It seems probable that Cynosura (dog's tail) really
was the name of the long tongue of land reaching out from Salamis
towards Psyttaleia, and that Ceos and Munychia are mentioned
because the prophecy must be fulfilled. Stein and Hauvette believe
Ceos to be identical with Cynosura, the former, as the regular
name, coming first and explaining the obsolete synonym; for this
use of <foreign lang="greek">τε καί</foreign> cf. ch. 43, 73. 3. Beloch's (Klio viii. 477) suggestion that
Ceos is the old name of Lipso Kutali (Psyttaleia) and his attempt

<p>This is perhaps the strongest profession of faith in oracles to be
found in H., often as he delights to notice the fulfilment of prophecy
(cf. ch. 20. 1 n., 96; ix. 43). His faith is in marked contrast with
the scepticism of Thucydides (ii. 17, 54; v. 26). Probably the
ordinary Athenian leaned to the side of faith. During the Peloponnesian 
war, oracles attributed to ancient seers, above all to
Bacis (ch. 20. 1 n.), were widely current at Athens (<bibl n="Thuc. 2.8">Thuc. ii. 8</bibl>, 21).
<pb n="262"/>
The keenness of the conflict between superstition and scepticism is

<p>The beginning <foreign lang="greek">ἀλλ’ ὅταν</foreign> was common in oracles (i. 55. 2; iii. 57. 4;

the Attic shore (<bibl n="Paus. 1.1.4">Paus. i. 1. 4</bibl>); or (2) if the oracle referred to the
fighting off Euboea, (<foreign rend="ital">a</foreign>) at Artemisium (vii. 176), or (<foreign rend="ital">b</foreign>) between
Euboea and Attica, or finally across the bay of Marathon from
Cynosura to Halae Araphenides and Brauron, the sites of two
temples to Artemis (Eur. Iph. Taur. 1450 f.; Strabo 399). But the

<p>The narrative of H. suggests, though it does not assert, that this was
the first return of Aristides to his country after his ostracism, which
took place at the time of Themistocles' increase of the fleet (<bibl n="Aristot. Ath. Pol. 22">Ath.
Pol. 22</bibl>) in 483-482, or a little before (484-483, Jerome, Eusebius).
But it appears that the general return of exiles must be placed in
the archonship of Hypsichides, i. e. before June 480 (<bibl n="Aristot. Ath. Pol. 22">Ath. Pol. 22</bibl>),
though Plutarch (Arist. 8) makes it synchronize with Xerxes' march
through Thessaly and Boeotia (July-August). Again, Xanthippus,
who had also been ostracized, returned before the evacuation of
Attica (Plut. Cato maj. 5; Philoch, fr. 84, F. H. G. i. 397). Finally,
in the capture of Psyttaleia, Aristides acts as general in command of
a large force of Attic hoplites, i. e. appears to be one of the strategi
(ch. 95 n.). If so, he must have been sent to Aegina on some mission,
perhaps to take Athenian refugees thither (Grundy, p. 390), or to fetch
the Aeacidae thence (Bury, Cl. Rev. x. 414 f.). The objection that
while Aristides reached Salamis overnight, the trireme with the
Aeacidae is not reported to have arrived till next morning (viii. 83),
is parried by Burrows' remark (Cl. Rev. xi. 258) that Aristides did
<pb n="263"/>
not arrive till after midnight (viii. 76, 81), so that the sailors would
have already turned in, and so would not welcome the Aeacidae till
daybreak. Nor is it easy to see how any ship could have evaded
the Persian blockade after Aristides. The objections remain that
the trireme which fetched the Aeacidae must surely have been
Aeginetan (viii. 64, 83, 84), and that, had Aristides been commissioned 
to escort the Aeacidae, H. would have known and mentioned 
so interesting a fact. With this character of Aristides cf.

the post second in honour (ix. 26 f.), the Lacedaemonians the post

the Lacedaemonians with the Athenians, and puts the Megarians

on the right and the Ionians on the left of the Persian line (xi. 17),

cf. vii. 3. 2; ix. 84. 2. There is no trace of any such charge elsewhere, 
and immediately after the battle the Athenians allowed the
following epitaph to be placed on the tomb of the Corinthians
buried at Salamis (Hicks, 18; cf. Plut. Mor. 870 E) [<foreign lang="greek">Ὢ ξεῖνε, εὔυδρ]όν

of the most active enemies of Athens at the outbreak of the Peloponnesian 
war (cf. vii. 137. 3; <bibl n="Thuc. 1.60">Thuc. i. 60</bibl>, 65, ii. 67). We should
not, with Plutarch (<foreign rend="ital">l. c.</foreign>), ascribe such tales to the malignity of H.

lengthy and laborious operation of such doubtful utility, while he
had confidence in the superiority of his fleet. Again, after the loss
of the battle and the retreat of his fleet, he could not hope to carry
through the undertaking. Alexander, indeed, succeeded at Tyre
(Arr. Anab. ii. 18), though only after defeating the Tyrian fleet, but
there the channel was less than half a mile in width and three
fathom deep, whereas at Salamis, even at the narrowest point by
the Heracleum (Ctesias, <foreign rend="ital">l. c.</foreign>), it is nearly a mile broad and four
fathom at least in depth. H. is therefore justified in regarding it
as a mere pretence to mask the retreat, unless indeed the whole

a wharf or pier, or, again, an invention on the analogy of Xerxes'

<p>H. is evidently here under the influence of traditions hostile to
Themistocles. There is no special reason to suspect him of double
dealing in this case; he may quite well have been honestly in
favour of breaking down the bridge and stirring up revolt among
the Greeks of Asia, and yet have resolved to sacrifice the project
rather than make a breach in the alliance with the Peloponnesians.
It is, however, hard to believe that he seriously contemplated
sending the fleet to the Hellespont while the Persian army was still
in Attica. Possibly he proposed the plan when Xerxes had begun
his retreat; cf. further &sect; 2 n. With this character of Themistocles

(Them. pp. 22, 49) and Wecklein (Ber. der bayer. Akad. (1876) p. 296;
with whom Meyer, iii, &sect; 226 n., seems disposed to agree) regard this
second message as an invention of the enemies of Themistocles,
designed to cloud the glory of the first. But Thucydides (<foreign rend="ital">l. c.</foreign>), rightly
construed, implies that some message warning Xerxes to retreat
was sent. It may have been, however, as Duncker (vii. 295 f.), following 
Ephorus (Diod. xi. 19) and Ctesias (26 <foreign lang="greek">φεύγει Ξέρξης βούλῃ

hasten the departure of Xerxes, although in his letter (ap. <bibl n="Thuc. 1.137">Thuc.

men; hence multitudes must have perished by the way. But in
all probability Xerxes left Mardonius the bulk of the land force;
otherwise what need was there for Artabazus with a corps from
Mardonius' army to escort him (ch. 126?). And that corps, whose
original strength was 60,000 (ch. 126), is estimated, even after its
heavy losses in the winter campaign (ch. 127 f.), as 40,000 strong
(ix. 66. 2). It would seem then that, even in Herodotus, the losses
and sufferings of the retreat have been much exaggerated. Yet
more incredible are the horrors in Aeschylus, the losses from
hunger and thirst in Thessaly, where Mardonius wintered, and the
disaster through the melting of the ice on the Strymon (<bibl n="Aesch. Pers. 495">Pers. 495</bibl> f.);
cf. Grote iv. 489 f. From the first the contrast between the proud
advance and the miserable retreat of Xerxes struck the Greek imagination, 
and the contrast got more and more exaggerated as time went
on. Cf. Justin ii. 13 &lsquo;ipse cum paucis Abydon contendit, ubi cum
solutum pontem hibernis tempestatibus offendisset, piscatoria scapha
trepidus traiecit . . . (carens) etiam omni servorum ministerio&rsquo;. We
may see from the scarcity of details, as well as from the suspicious
character of some of those given, both in H. and Aeschylus, how
slight was the knowledge the Greeks had of the retreat of Xerxes,
as compared with the full account of his advance (vii. 61 n.).</p></div3>

<p>The old city of Lebadeia stood at the mouth of a wild gorge,
probably on the eastern bank of the Hercyna, about ten minutes
north of the modern town, while the grove of Trophonius was on the
western bank (Strabo 414; <bibl n="Paus. 9.37.5">Paus. ix. 37. 5</bibl>, with Frazer, v. 196 f.).</p>
<p>The legend of Trophonius is the common folk-tale of the Clever
Thief (cf. ii. 121 <foreign lang="greek">β</foreign>; for his end cf. <ref target="c.1.31.3" targOrder="U">i. 31. 3 n.</ref>). Trophonius appears to
have been originally the chief local god of Lebadeia (<bibl n="Paus. 1.34.2">Paus. i. 34. 2</bibl>);
later, in accordance with a common tendency of Greek religion as it
became systematized, he was degraded into a hero. On inscriptions
he is sometimes distinguished from and sometimes identified with
Zeus Basileus: Strabo (<foreign rend="ital">l. c.</foreign>) speaks of an oracle of Zeus Trophonius,
and Livy (xlv. 27) of a temple, yet Pausanias (ix. 39. 5) distinguishes
Zeus Basileus and Trophonius. Cicero seems to identify Trophonius 
with Mercury (de Nat. Deor. iii. 22. 56). His statue by
Praxiteles had the appearance and attributes of Aesculapius, particularly 
the snake, perhaps the earliest representation of the god
(cf. <bibl n="Paus. 9.39.3">Paus. ix. 39. 3</bibl>). Pausanias (<foreign rend="ital">l. c.</foreign>) describes the way of consulting
the oracle from his own experience. The inquirer had first to live
some days in the shrine of &lsquo;Agathos Daemon&rsquo; and Tyche, to eat
sacrificial meats and wash in the water of the Hercyna, and to sacrifice 
a ram. Then at night he was taken to the springs of Lethe and
Mnemosyne, to drink forgetfulness of the past and memory for the
revelations to come. Thence the priests took him to a vaulted
cave on the hill; from the upper chamber he climbed down a
small ladder into a pit some six feet across and twelve feet deep,
bearing honey-cakes in his hands to appease the chthonian deity.
There, lying on his back, he worked his way feet foremost through
a small opening into the inner shrine and returned in the same way
afterwards. While still bewildered and under the influence of the
deity, the priests placed him on the chair of Mnemosyne, and asked
him what he had seen and heard. His answer was interpreted and
versified (<bibl n="Paus. 4.32.5">Paus. iv. 32. 5</bibl>) by the priests. For Trophonius cf. Farnell,

probably visited not his most famous shrine near Oropus (Paus.
<pb n="281"/>
i. 34) but one near Thebes. Amphiaraus, probably originally a
chthonian deity, became in legend an Argive hero, one of the Seven
against Thebes. The earth was said to have swallowed him up,
by some at Harma (Paus. <foreign rend="ital">l. c.</foreign>; ix. 19. 4), by others at a place
between Potniae and Thebes, where there was a shrine (<bibl n="Paus. 9.8.3">Paus. ix.
8. 3</bibl>). This would seem to be the place meant here, since the offerings
made by Croesus to Amphiaraus were transferred to the temple of
Ismenian Apollo at Thebes (i. 52), and the refusal to permit Thebans
to consult the oracles reads like a taboo against natives. Strabo
expressly tells us (404) that the oracle of Amphiaraus was brought
to Oropus from Cnopia in the Theban territory, and this may have
happened just after H. wrote (cf. Frazer, v. 31). In any case the
usages would seem to have been similar. We may compare the
oracle of Calchas at Drium in Apulia (Strabo 284) and of Faunus
(<bibl n="Verg. A. 7.81">Virg. Aen. vii. 81</bibl> f.; Ovid, Fast. iv. 649). Amphiaraus was consulted

stadia away from Acraephia, in a little valley beneath the true

<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ἕβδομος</lemma>. Alexander himself is included (cf. ch. 139). It is usual
in ordinals to count in both the beginning and the end, but the
method seems strange when it causes a man to be counted among
his own ancestors (cf. i. 91. 1) or descendants (i. 13. 2). Thucydides
agrees as to the number of the Macedonian kings and in tracing
their descent from Temenus of Argos (ii. 99 f.; v. 80); but in the
fourth century another account was current, probably derived from
Theopompus (fr. 30, F. H. G. i. 283; cf. Diod. vii. fr. 17; Euphorion
fr. 24, <foreign rend="ital">inf.</foreign>; Vell. Paterc. i. 6. 5; Justin vii. 1, &amp;c.). By this
Caranus (&lsquo;head leader&rsquo;), son or brother of the Argive king Pheidon
(cf. <ref target="c.6.127.3" targOrder="U">vi. 127. 3 n.</ref>), is made the founder of the Macedonian dynasty,
and is succeeded by <foreign lang="greek">Κοῖνος</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">Τυρίμμας</foreign> (Satyr. fr. 21, F. H. G. iii.
164), who precede the first Perdiccas. The object of this lengthening 
of the line was to make the Macedonian dynasty at least as old
as the Median (cf. <ref target="c.6.127.3" targOrder="U">vi. 127. 3 n.</ref>).</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ἐξ Ἄργεος</lemma>. Argos in the Peloponnese appears as the ancestral
home of the family in all versions of the legend (Isocr. Phil. 32).
But the Argos with which the Argeadae (cf. Appian, Syr. 63 <foreign lang="greek">Ἄργος τὸ
ἐν Ὀρεστείᾳ ὅθεν οἱ Ἀργεάδαι Μακεδόνες</foreign>, Strabo 329, fr. 11 <foreign lang="greek">τούτων δὲ
πάντων οἱ Ἀργεάδαι καλούμενοι κύριοι</foreign>) were really connected is Argos
Oresticum (Strabo 326; Steph. Byz.), near the source of the Haliacmon. 
They first held the fruitful valleys there (valley of Kastoria),
and the hill country as far as the source of the Erigon; this is the
Upper Macedonia (cf. <ref target="c.7.128.1" targOrder="U">vii. 128. 1 n.</ref>) where the three brothers served
(<foreign rend="ital">inf.</foreign>), and to which Caranus went by order of an oracle (Euphorion,
fr. 24 <foreign lang="greek">ἐκπρολιπὼν Ἄργος τε καὶ Ἑλλάδα καλλιγύναικα  χώρει πρὸς πηγὰς
Ἁλιάκμονος</foreign>). The Argeadae (cf. <bibl n="Paus. 7.8.9">Paus. vii. 8. 9</bibl>) later made Aegae
their capital, and established an hegemony over the kindred tribes
(cf. <bibl n="Thuc. 2.99">Thuc. ii. 99</bibl>) in Upper Macedon, the Lyncestae, Orestae,
Elimiotae, as well as over the coastlands as far as the Axius.</p>
<p>The likeness of name (Argos and Argeadae) led the Macedonian
kings, at least from the time of Alexander I (cf. <ref target="c.5.22.2" targOrder="U">v. 22. 2 n.</ref>; ix. 45. 2),
<pb n="283"/>
to claim descent from the Heracleid kings of Peloponnesian Argos,
just as the princes of the Lyncestae did from the Corinthian
Bacchiads, those of the Molossi from Achilles (Strabo 327), and the
Illyrian Enchelees (cf. <ref target="c.5.61.2" targOrder="U">v. 61. 2 n.</ref>) from Cadmus. Yet their names
are not even Greek, and their origin is at least doubtful (cf. <ref target="c.5.22.2" targOrder="U">v. 22. 2 n.</ref>).
In the legend the name Argos is misinterpreted, and Temenus is
falsely inserted. Probably <foreign lang="greek">ἐς Ἰλλυριούς</foreign> is put in because these
Argives are believed to have come to Macedon by land from the
West. Otherwise the story is a folk-tale, current among the
Argeadae, about their earlier homes and the claim of their princes
to their possession.</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">Γαυάνης</lemma>: probably = <foreign lang="greek">βουκόλος</foreign>, since in Sanskrit <foreign rend="ital">g&ocirc;</foreign> = <foreign lang="greek">βοῦς</foreign>. If so,
<foreign lang="greek">Ἀέροπος</foreign> may refer to horses (cf. <foreign lang="greek">Φίλιππος</foreign>) and Perdiccas to goats.
The three brothers represent three tribes (Hesych. <foreign lang="greek">Ἀέροπος, ἐν
Μακεδονίᾳ γένος τι</foreign>), as in the Scythic legend (iv. 5 n.). Another point
of resemblance is the superiority of the youngest brother.</p>

fleeing thence founds a city, named, from the goat which led him,
Aegae (Hygin. 219). He appeared on the stage as a goatherd

Cisseus, the king of Orestis, to conquer the Eordi, guided by a
goatherd surprised the stronghold which he renamed Aegae.

<p>H. clearly holds that the idea of throwing Persian gold into the
scale, and of gaining by bribery what they had failed to win by
force, dates from the defeat of Salamis (cf. ch. 5, 41 and Diod. xi. 28).
Nor is it improbable that the question was then mooted. But the
first clear instances of such bribery, the missions of Megabazus
(457 B. C.; cf. <bibl n="Thuc. 1.109">Thuc. i. 109</bibl>) and of Arthmius of Zeleia, are later.
Though Plutarch (Them. 6) seems to place the latter at the time of
Xerxes' invasion, and attributes the man's punishment to Themistocles, 
the words of the decree inscribed on the pillar in the Acropolis,
<foreign lang="greek">Ἄρθμιος Πυθωνάκτος Ζελείτης ἄτιμος [ἔστω] καὶ πολέμιος τοῦ δήμου τοῦ

Ael. Aristid. Dind. i. 310), make it probable that Athens was then at
variance with the Peloponnesians. Again, though Plutarch ascribes
the decree to Themistocles, Craterus (quoted by the scholiast on
Aristides, <foreign rend="ital">l. c.</foreign>) assigned it to Cimon. If so, Arthmius' mission
must be placed after the outbreak of the war between Athens and
the Peloponnese and the subsequent recall of Cimon, i.e. after
457 B. C. (cf. E. Meyer, iii. &sect; 337; Busolt, ii. 653, n. 3).</p>

and esp. <bibl n="Aesch. Ag. 280">Aesch. Agam. 280</bibl> f. the signals telling the fall of Troy).
Apparently the numbers and direction of a hostile force could be
signalled (Thuc. <foreign rend="ital">l. c.</foreign>); yet for want of an adequate code, only more
or less foreseen contingencies could be signalled even in the days of
Polybius, though much attention had been paid to the art (Polyb. x.

writers are in substantial agreement as to the fate of Cyrsilus or
Lycides, and that the transference of this famous case of lynching
to the previous year (480 B. C.), when the Athenians retired before
Xerxes, is a confusion due to Cicero's (de Off. iii. 11, &sect; 48) misinterpretation 
of Demosthenes (de Cor. &sect;&sect; 202, 204). It is clear from
H. and Lycurgus (in Leocratem, &sect; 122) that the lynching took
place in Salamis, and was a well-known case recorded in a decree.
Demosthenes' date (&sect; 202) is vague, &lsquo;when the Athenians had the
hardihood to abandon their land and city and take to their ships,&rsquo;
but may as probably refer to the continued or repeated exodus of
479 as to 480 B. C.; and by stating (&sect; 202), in language reminiscent
of H. (viii. 140), that Athens had received offers from the king of
Persia, by which she might have kept her own land and been given
more, Demosthenes really fixes the event to 479, since in 480
Xerxes never offered Athens any such terms. Cicero has blundered,
and H. is confirmed by the Greek orators. Probably, however, he
has inadvertently substituted an ominous (cf. vii. 180) patronymic
(Lycides = son of Lycus, &lsquo;wolfling&rsquo;) for the victim's true name
Cyrsilus. The lynching of Cyrsilus is paralleled by the fury of the
Hollanders in tearing De Witt to pieces.</p></div3></div>

summer's heat. On the first day the offerings of the dead were

with wine and milk (<bibl n="Paus. 3.19.3">Paus. iii. 19. 3</bibl>). Abstinence and melancholy

plain unleavened cakes were eaten. The second day was a joyful
festival sacred to Apollo; boys celebrated the praises of Apollo in
anapaestic measures to the accompaniment of cithara and flute;
there was a horse race of boys and a solemn procession of maidens
in chariots. Probably the robe woven by Spartan women (<bibl n="Paus. 3.16.2">Paus. iii.

<p>H.'s account of the long delay and sudden dispatch of the Spartans
is obviously inadequate. The wall was probably defensible in the
autumn of 480 B. C. (viii. 71). Again, there can have been no need
for a Tegean to show the Spartan government that &lsquo;a great door
to the Peloponnese was open&rsquo; from the sea, if the Athenian navy
changed sides (cf. Plut. de Mal. 41. 871 E). But the delay, as well
as the secrecy and speed of the mobilization can be explained if we
remember (1) that Argos had an understanding with Mardonius
(ch. 12), (2) that the Eleans and Mantineans were at least wavering,
since they arrived too late for the battle of Plataea (ch. 77), and afterwards 
banished their generals, presumably for Medism; indeed no
Arcadians except the men of Tegea and Orchomenus (ch. 28) fought
at Plataea. The Argives may have hoped to anticipate the strategy
of Alcibiades in 418 B. C. (<bibl n="Thuc. 5.57">Thuc. v. 57</bibl> f.) by cutting off the Spartans
from their northern allies. This explains why the Spartans marched
by Orestheum (ch. 11. 2 n.) well away from the Argive frontier. It
may, however, well be true that the Ephors were at last induced to
<pb n="290"/>
risk an attack from Argos and a rising in Arcadia, by the fear that
the loyalty of Athens would stand no further strain.</p>
<p>H. puts the whole Spartiate force at 8,000 (vii. 234. 2 n.). The
5,000 here may be meant for two-thirds of the host, a common proportion 
(<bibl n="Thuc. 2.10">Thuc. ii. 10</bibl>; iii. 15), or for a corps of 1,000 from each

<p>The eclipse, which was partial, was on October 2, 480 B. C. (Busolt,

Persians as they retreated from Attica, probably by marching
through the Megarid to occupy the passes of Cithaeron in their
rear (cf. ch. 13, 14). But to risk all that had been won at Salamis in
another battle was utterly opposed to the cautious policy of Sparta.
The eclipse only justified a timidity in keeping with the situation
and with the orders no doubt given to Cleombrotus. The return
home was due to the approach of winter, during which a Greek

<p>It is most unlikely that Mardonius, who had determined to fight

Pausanias (ix. 4. 4) puts it forty stades down the Asopus from the

Munro (J. H. S. xxiv. 153-4) follows Leake in placing it near Darimari,

road from Attica by Panactum crossed it. Grundy (p. 449 n.,

They are so regarded by some authorities quoted by Strabo (<foreign rend="ital">l. c.</foreign>)
and by Pausanias (ix. 2. 1, 4. 4). At some date before 424 B. C.
(perhaps only when Plataea fell in 427) these small places became

of the Asopus, the bridge being further defended on the south side

<p>The station of the Megarians open to cavalry attack was doubtless 
the comparatively level ground where the road from Eleutherae
to Thebes comes down from the pass. Grundy (p. 458 f.) rightly
holds that the Greeks had come over the Dryoscephalae pass, and
now were drawn up with their centre astride of the road, the
Megarians being in the left centre of the Greek line (ch. 28. 6, 31. 5).
Macan's suggestion that the Greeks were but just emerging from
the pass in a column headed by the Megarians or by the Athenians
is opposed to the clear statement of H. (ch. 19. 3).</p>
<p>Munro (J. H. S. xxiv. 157) puts forward the over-elaborate
hypothesis that Pausanias marched with the bulk of his forces by
Oenoe and Panactum, and finding himself checked by the Persian
stockade, deployed his army to the left along the base of the
mountain, continually extending his left flank westward as more
troops came into line. Thus the Megarians might temporarily
form the extreme left of the army. The Athenians would next
come up (to take post to their left), and on them would naturally
fall the duty of relieving the distressed Megarians.</p></div3>

to H. by some near relation of Olympiodorus. He was no doubt
the father of the more famous Lampon, the seer and interpreter

defines the position of the left wing. Neither spring nor precinct
can be identified with certainty. Woodhouse (J. H. S. xviii. 37-8)
still maintains that Apotripi, the traditional site, is the true
Gargaphia, but Grundy (p. 465 n.) and Munro (J. H. S. xxiv. 159)
seem right in preferring Leake's Gargaphia, a more abundant spring
in a much more conspicuous position. The heroon of Androcrates
is placed by Grundy (466 f.) within three-quarters of a mile of
Plataea, to the right of the road to Thebes (cf. <bibl n="Thuc. 3.24">Thuc. iii. 24</bibl>).

here in question. Woodhouse (J. H. S. xviii. 41) argues strongly
that the story of this quarrel for precedence is an Athenian invention. 
The dispute, if historical, must have taken place earlier,
i. e. directly the Greeks fell into position on Mount Cithaeron.
Now the Athenians were probably then already on the left (ch. 21),
as they succour the Megarians. Further, the Tegeans are found
occupying the position next the Spartans not only here (ch. 28) but
at Mantinea in 418 B. C. (<bibl n="Thuc. 5.71">Thuc. v. 71</bibl>) and at Corinth in 394 B. C.

<p>Amazons are favourite subjects of sculptors and vase-painters.

<p>The studied variety of phrases used by H. to express the same

<p>The great importance of this chapter for the question of Greek

<p>The repeated assertion that there were seven Helots to each
Spartiate (ch. 10. 1, 29. 1, 61. 2) evidently rests on something more
than mere conjecture. The words <foreign lang="greek">ἐφύλασσον</foreign> most naturally would
mean that they were in personal attendance on their master, but
elsewhere each Spartiate has but one squire (<foreign lang="greek">θεράπων</foreign>, cf. <ref target="c.7.186" targOrder="U">vii. 186.
2 n.</ref>, 229. 1 n.). Kr&uuml;ger would take it to mean that the light-armed
Helots covered the right wing from the attacks of the Persian
horse and archers; but though H. regards them as combatants
(<foreign lang="greek">μάχιμοι</foreign>, ch. 30; cf. 29. 8), there is nowhere any indication that they
played an effective part in the fighting, though archers, and presumably 
other light troops, were urgently required (ch. 60). Hence
<pb n="299"/>
at best they can only have been an army service corps (ch. 39, 50);

that it is unlikely that any Potidaeans fought at Plataea, and that
H. put them in erroneously because he found their name on the
memorial at Delphi (ch. 81 n.), while Beloch (<foreign rend="ital">l. c.</foreign>) would derive the
whole list of names from the same source. Both views seem
unlikely; cf. ch. 81 n. Obst (Der Feldzug des Xerxes, pp. 62-6)
accepts the numbers given by Herodotus for the contingents of
hoplites, and argues for the presence of the Paleans and Potidaeans
at Plataea, which Munro (C. A. H. iv. 323) now doubts.</p></div3>

ship to Salamis, was not inscribed on the Delphic memorial because
of the insignificance of its contingent.</p></div3>

<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">Μεγαρέων τρισχίλιοι</lemma>. Beloch (<foreign rend="ital">op. cit.</foreign> and Klio vi. 52-7) holds
that the 5,000 hoplites assigned to Corinth (&sect; 3) and the 3,000 to
Sicyon (&sect; 4) and Megara are all exaggerated estimates. He points
out (Bev&ouml;lk., p. 119) that the field army of Corinth in the Peloponnesian

these towns must have lost very much in strength during the period of
the Athenian empire; all had been very important in the 6th century.</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">Πλαταιέες ἑξακόσιοι</lemma>. In spite of Beloch's doubts (p. 165) this
number agrees very well with the data in Thucydides, for the
Plataeans much outnumber their 300 Theban assailants (ii. 3), and
still number 400 after the removal of all but those necessary to
garrison the town (ii. 78). As the campaign was in their territory,
they would come in full force, <foreign lang="greek">πανδημεί</foreign> (vi. 108) or <foreign lang="greek">πανστρατιᾷ</foreign>

(vi. 117 n.) and with the field army of 13,000 hoplites in 431 B. C.,

uses the name for the brook marked &lsquo;A. 1&rsquo; on his plan, the

with other writers (Woodhouse, J. H. S. xviii. 56; Munro, J. H. S.

to the main stream. Mardonius' foot was stationed on the left

punished with madness. They wandered in the wilderness and
were joined by more and more Argive women, so that in despair
the Argives summoned Melampus from the court of Neleus at Pylos
(Apoll. i. 9. 11; Diodor. iv. 68). Melampus, well acquainted with
the mysteries of Dionysus (cf. ii. 49), healed and purified the
maidens, perhaps with Melampodium, black hellebore (<bibl n="Plin. Nat. 25.47">Plin. N. H.

democratic movement at Mantinea (<bibl n="Aristot. Pol. 6.1318b">Ar. Pol. 1318 b 25-7</bibl>), placed
<foreign rend="ital">circ.</foreign> 470 B. C. by Busolt (iii. 118), should be dated ten years later,
since Mantinea took no part in the battle of Dipaea, and assisted
Sparta in the Messenian war, i. e. at Ithome (<bibl n="Xen. Hell. 5.2">Xen. Hell. v. 2</bibl>, 3);

movement against Sparta, i. e. <foreign rend="ital">circ.</foreign> 473-470 B. C. (Busolt, iii. 121 n. 1;
Meyer, iii. &sect; 285). Themistocles would then be in Argos intriguing
against Sparta, if the traditional date for the fall of Themistocles
(470 B. C.) refers not to his ostracism (as Meyer, iii. &sect; 286 n.) but to
his final expulsion and flight (Busolt, iii. 112 n. 2). Tegea would
seem to have been hostile to Sparta just before as well as after the
Persian war. At any rate, Hegesistratus found refuge there before
480 B. C. (ix. 37), and Leotychides afterwards (vi. 72). Apparently
the Tegeans, though defeated in the battle here mentioned, defended
their city with success (Simonides, fr. 103). They were, however,
induced then or later by Cleandridas to accept oligarchy and
Spartan hegemony. Yet they seem to have been still in alliance
with Argos at the time of the destruction of Mycenae, i. e. <foreign rend="ital">circ.</foreign>

<p>The use of his overwhelming cavalry to cut communications was the
obvious course for Mardonius (cf. App. XXII. 5). Even a temporary
cutting of the lines, by such a raid as is here described, was serious,
and might at any time be repeated. Dryoscephalae is usually
rightly identified with the pass of Gyphto Kastro (cf. Grundy, 447,
<pb n="305"/>
493 n.; Frazer, <bibl n="Paus. 5.2">Paus. v. 2</bibl>), through which the main road from
Athens and Eleusis by Eleutherae to Thebes passed in ancient as
in modern times. This is the natural interpretation of Thucydides
(iii. 24), and a modern traveller (Vischer, Erinner aus Griech. p. 533)
states that the &lsquo;three heads&rsquo; after which the Boeotians named the
pass can be plainly distinguished from their side. On the other hand,
the words <foreign lang="greek">αἱ ἐπὶ Πλαταιέων φέρουσι</foreign> hardly suit this pass. Hence
Munro would include under the name the whole group of passes
(J. H. S. xxiv. 155 n.), and others, e. g. Stein and Rawlinson, identify
&lsquo;Dryoscephalae&rsquo; with Grundy's second pass. Through this came
probably the main road to Thebes from Megara and the Peloponnese
over Mount Kardyes by the modern Vilia (J. H. S. xxiv. 155, 156).
Cleombrotus used it in 378 B. C., and thus avoided touching Attic
territory (<bibl n="Xen. Hell. 5.4.14">Xen. Hell. v. 4. 14</bibl>, 19). Grundy's third road (called by

<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">τῶν δέκα</lemma>: i. e. the eight days mentioned in ch. 39. 1 and the two in
ch. 40. 1. It is, however, a suspicious circumstance that throughout
the story of this campaign H. reckons in periods of ten days, i. e. in
Greek weeks. The Athenian envoys are ten days in Sparta (ch. 8),
the Greek army is in position inactive for ten days, it advances on
Thebes ten days after the battle (ch. 86), while Thebes surrenders
after a siege of twenty days (ch. 87. 1); cf. Busolt, ii. 726 n.; Meyer,
iii. &sect; 236 n. Woodhouse (J. H. S. xviii. 58) further argues that the
point of departure in H.'s chronology is uncertain; the words
<foreign lang="greek">ἀντικατημένοισι ἐν Πλαταιῆσι</foreign> (cf. ch. 39. 1), usually and naturally taken
to refer to the occupation of the second position by the Greeks
(ch. 25), he would refer to the opening of the campaign when the
Greeks seized their first position on the slopes of Cithaeron. He
also suspects H. of duplicating the interval of two days between
the closing of the passes and the final battle, regarding the two
days of waiting as purposeless, and the Persian Council, the visit of
Alexander, and the challenge of Mardonius as fictitious. He thus
compresses the campaign from the occupation of the first position
<pb n="306"/>
to the final battle within a space of eleven days. Such bold reconstructions 
must of necessity be hypothetical. We may, however,
agree that H.'s chronology is too vague to be satisfactory, and
that there is more than one improbable incident in his narrative.
Especially we may note with Munro (J. H. S. xxiv. 160) and Macan
(ii. 349, 369, 376) the improbability that the Greeks remained so
long in their advanced position on the Asopus Ridge, and that
Mardonius on his part delayed so long the cutting of their communications 
(cf. Appendix XXII. 5).</p>

<p>The idea is not that the whole army should or could find refuge
within the walls of Thebes, but that the city should be made the
base of the army, and the wooden fort on the Asopus (ch. 15. 2 n.)
be given up. In view of the Greek advance, a base on the Asopus
may well have seemed too far forward.</p>
<p>The existence of plentiful supplies at Thebes is inconsistent with
Alexander's report of a shortage on the Asopus (45. 2), since with
superior cavalry it must have been easy to maintain communication
between them. The statement here is probably accurate, as it
comes from a better source (Busolt, ii. 730 n.) and is more in accord
with the care of the Persians for their commissariat (cf. vii. 25).
Grundy (pp. 476, 477), however, holds that the Phocians, who were

supplies to run short.</p></div3>

probable by Woodhouse (J. H. S. xviii. 36) and Munro (J. H. S.

Busolt (ii. 730); but it may be a mere anecdote designed to illustrate

More serious objections are the improbability of his assertion that

<p>Few critics or historians will now accept this story of marching
and countermarching as the literal truth. These man&oelig;uvres could
not be carried out by large bodies of troops in face of the enemy in
a single day (Hauvette, p. 469). Such conduct on the part of
Spartans is unexampled (Grote), and would surely have demoralized
the whole Greek army. The foundation of the story is probably
some man&oelig;uvre whose purpose was misunderstood by H. (Grundy,
p. 470), or wilfully misrepresented by his Athenian informants
(Woodhouse, J. H. S. xviii. 47, &amp;c.). The simplest hypothesis is
that of E. Meyer (iii, p. 40), that the Spartans moved to the left
wing because when the Greeks advanced that was the post of
danger. Munro (J. H. S. xxiv. 159, 160) suggests that the troops
marched to the second position by brigades, and that the Spartans,
moving first, marched by the Athenians, and then the Athenians in
turn pushed on behind this screen of troops and again formed the
left wing near the Asopus.</p>

Thermopylae, feared the Persian&mdash;they certainly had more reason

<p>At the present day there is no such &lsquo;island&rsquo; as H. describes near
Plataea. But the Greeks felt no objection to calling a peninsula an
island; cf. Peloponnesus, Chersonesus, &amp;c. Leake and Vischer
identified as &lsquo;the island&rsquo; a level stretch of meadow land intersected
by several streams, which later unite to form the Oeroe. Grundy
(p. 481 f.) objects that in September, when the battle was fought,
these streams would be dry before they reached this part of the
plain, and that their beds offer no obstacle to cavalry. Further, in
order to reach this supposed refuge from the cavalry, the Greek
army, already shaken, would have had to cross a mile of open
country exposed to its attacks. Finally, this tongue of land is surrounded 
by good cavalry ground, so that in case of defeat, the Greek
army would have been in a hopeless position. Grundy, therefore,
rightly prefers (p. 484 f.) the ridge or ridges at the foot of Cithaeron
between the upper courses of the same streams, because this
position is almost unassailable by cavalry, and lies (<foreign lang="greek">πρὸ τῆς Πλαταιέων
πόλιος</foreign>) east of Plataea, the side towards which the city looks,
and from which it is naturally approached. The only difficulty is
the statement that it is ten stades from the Asopus. If we reject
Grundy's use of the name for the tributary stream from Apotripi
(ch. 31. 1 n.), we must either with Woodhouse (J. H. S. xviii. 57)
<pb n="310"/>
insert <foreign lang="greek">κ́</foreign> = 20 after <foreign lang="greek">Ἀσωποῦ</foreign> before <foreign lang="greek">καί</foreign>, or with Munro hold that the

<p>H. speaks as if the whole force was first to take position on the

sideways along the hills to the pass or passes over Cithaeron. It
is, however, far more likely that only a part of the army was
intended to occupy the island, probably only the Athenians, while
the Spartans themselves undertook the difficult operation of relieving
the provision trains blocked in the passes, and thus reopening the
communications of the Greek army (Grundy, p. 492; Woodhouse,
p. 53). They would also permanently secure the passes for the

<p>H. evidently believed that the Greek centre, including all the

fled in a panic. But, if so, it is not easy to see why they halted and
piled arms before Plataea, instead of making directly for the PlataeaMegara 
pass (Grundy, p. 490). Woodhouse (J. H. S. xviii, p. 50 f.),
followed by Munro and Macan (ii. 382), suggests that the centre
really occupied its intended position. Hence it was readily reached

Caracalla, in forming a number of young Spartans into a <foreign lang="greek">λόχος
Πιτανάτης</foreign>, believed himself to be imitating ancient usage (Herodian,
iv. 8). There is a good deal of evidence for the view that the
earliest <foreign lang="greek">λόχοι</foreign> at Sparta were local corps, probably five in number
(cf. Gilbert, G. C. A. p. 68 f.). Schol. Arist. Lysist. 454 <foreign lang="greek">λόχοι γὰρ οὐκ

perhaps represents a corps of 1,000 from each Spartan village.
We may explain the direct contradiction in Thucydides by supposing 
that H. has made a mistake as to the name of the <foreign lang="greek">λόχος</foreign>,
since Pitana, though an important suburb (cf. iii. 55. 2), was not,
according to the scholiasts, one of the &lsquo;quarters&rsquo; after which the
<foreign lang="greek">λόχοι</foreign> were called, or less probably by the fact that the organization
of the Spartan army, which was kept a secret (<bibl n="Thuc. 5.68">Thuc. v. 68</bibl>), had
been changed before Thucydides wrote, probably at the time of the

<p>The Spartans and Tegeans formed together the right wing.</p>
<p>The excuse put forward by the Athenians to explain their own
failure to reach their appointed post on the &lsquo;island&rsquo; does not hold
water (Woodhouse, J. H. S. xviii. 52; Macan, ii. 383). Why
should Pausanias after ordering a general retreat expose his own
division unsupported to Persian attack? Probably in the end he
reached, or all but reached, his appointed station (App. XXII. 6;
Macan ii. 382). If he delayed to start, it was probably because he
<pb n="312"/>
intended himself to cover the retreat of the other divisions, and the
Athenians, by their own admission, were not yet moving. It is probable 
enough that already in 479 B. C. there was mistrust of Sparta at
Athens, caused by the delay in sending help, and justified perhaps
by the jealousy shown in Sparta's attempts to prevent the rebuilding
of the walls of Athens (478 B. C.; <bibl n="Thuc. 1.89">Thuc. i. 89</bibl> f.; cf. App. XXII <foreign rend="ital">ad

<p>If Hude is right in adopting the conjecture <foreign lang="greek">δ́</foreign> = 4 for <foreign lang="greek">δέκα</foreign> = 10,
there can be little doubt that Grundy's identification of the temple
of Eleusinian Demeter (p. 496) with the modern church of St.
Demetrius should be accepted, as it is some four and a half stades
from his Gargaphia. The church is, however, nearer his stream
A 5, with which he at first (1894; cf. Topography of Plataea, p. 33)
identified the Moloeis, than the more important stream A 6, which
he now (G. P. W. p. 495) prefers. The <foreign lang="greek">Ἀργιόπιος χῶρος</foreign> is unknown.</p>
<p>If the MS. reading <foreign lang="greek">δέκα</foreign> be retained (cf. App. XXII. 6), it would
seem probable that there is a confusion between two temples. There
were at least two temples of Demeter within the field of operations,

either on some high ground about fifteen stades from Plataea, where
now are the foundations of a large Byzantine church (Hauvette,

west of the Eleutherae-Thebes road, where two inscriptions have
been found relating to the worship of Demeter (Frazer, Paus. v, p. 5;
Munro, J. H. S. xxiv. 163), while that mentioned in ch. 65 would be
the modern Demetrion. Grundy, although he retains the ten stades

Spartans who fell (61. 3, 63. 1), and the long struggle between the
Spartans and Persians (62. 2) and between the Athenians and
Boeotians (67. 1). Probably H. misunderstood the inscriptions on

Athenians all belonged to the tribe Aeantis (Clidemus ap. <bibl n="Plut. Arist. 19">Plut.

<p>This vague expression of opinion as to the superiority of the Spartans

Plutarch (Arist. 20; de Malig. Herod. 42, Mor. 873 A) speaks of a
bitter rivalry between Spartans and Athenians as to the Aristeia and
setting up the Trophy, happily settled by the mediation of Aristides

to award the prize to the Plataeans. But this story seems due to
the late and untrustworthy Idomeneus. It was clearly unknown to

Theseus, with his comrade Peirithous, seized the girl Helen as she
was dancing at the feast of Artemis Orthia, and placed her under

the heroic son of Ischenous, captured at Sciathus and released at
Salamis (vii. 181; viii. 92). It is, however, tempting to identify
Lampon with the father of the Pytheas, whose victory as a youth at
Nemea (before 480 B. C.) was celebrated both by Pindar (Nem. v.)
and by Bacchylides (Ode xiii), while those of his brother Phylacidas
at the Isthmus (480, 478 B. C.) were sung by Pindar (Isthm. iv
and v). The objection is that Pindar (Isthm. v. 16) speaks of
Lampon as son of Cleonicus, but Cleonicus may be a remoter
ancestor (cf. Isthm. iv. 55) or a title given to Pytheas from the
numerous athletic victories of the family (Isthm. iv. 17 f.; v. 60 f.).
Lampon belonged to the great house of the Psalychidae (Isthm.

<p>The famous golden tripod at Delphi and the statues at Olympia
(and at the Isthmus) were dedicated from the spoil won at Plataea,
and hence were regarded by Pausanias (v. 23. 1; x. 13. 9) as
trophies of that victory alone. But the words which head the list
<pb n="322"/>
of states inscribed on the bronze triple serpent supporting the
tripod. [<foreign lang="greek">Τ]ο[ίδε τὸν] πόλεμον [ἐ]πολ[έ]μεον</foreign>, as well as those of Thucydides 
(i. 132), <foreign lang="greek">ὅσαι συγκαθελοῦσαι τὸν βάρβαρον ἔστησαν τὸ ἀνάθημα</foreign>,
show that it was regarded as a memorial of the whole war (cf. the
inclusion of states which fought at Salamis only, viii. 82. 1 n.).
Either on the stone pedestal of the column or, less probably, on
the thirteenth coil of the serpent, which has been flattened to
receive the words given above, Pausanias had originally inscribed
<foreign lang="greek">Ἑλλάνων ἀρχαγὸς ἐπεὶ στρατὸν ὤλεσα Μήδων  Παυσανίας Φοίβῳ μνᾶμ̓
ἀνέθηκα τόδε</foreign> (Anthol. i. 133; xliii; less characteristically given in
<foreign lang="greek">κοινή</foreign> and in the third person by <bibl n="Thuc. 1.132">Thuc. i. 132</bibl>, &amp;c.). Probably the
place of this erased inscription was taken by the couplet quoted by
Diodorus (xi. 33. 2), <foreign lang="greek">Ἑλλάδος εὐρυχόρου σωτῆρες τόνδ’ ἀνέθηκαν  δουλοσύνης 
στυγερᾶς ῥυσάμενοι πόλιας</foreign>. Probably the three feet of the
tripod rested on the three serpents' heads, though there is no mark
of a join on the top of the one still extant. It is less likely that the
feet of the tripod rested on the stone base, and that the serpent
column was merely the central prop of the golden cauldron supported 
by the tripod. In the sacred war (355 B. C.) the Phocians
stole the golden part of the monument but left the bronze (<bibl n="Paus. 10.13.9">Paus.
x. 13. 9</bibl>). Constantine carried off the serpent column and placed it
in the Hippodrome (Atmeidan) at Constantinople, where it still
remains. It was apparently converted into a three-mouthed fountain 
by a later emperor. It was seen and described by travellers
from 1422 on, but in 1700 was thrown down and the serpents' heads
were broken off. The base of the column was excavated by
Sir C. T. Newton (1855) and the inscription published in 1856 by
O. Frick and Dethier; a revised version is due to Fabricius (1886).
Of the twenty-nine serpent coils fifteen had been underground, the
inscription beginning on the thirteenth coil and ending on the
third; the twelfth and thirteenth coils have been scarred and
dented with sabre cuts, so the inscription is hardly legible.</p>
<p>The list of states on the serpent column should be compared with
that on the trophy at Olympia and with those given by H. of the
Greeks who fought at Plataea and Salamis, as is done on the opposite
page.</p>
<p>It will be noticed that five names found in H. are not given
on the Delphic inscription, and that four more are omitted by
Pausanias. Prof. A. Bauer (Wiener Studien, 1887, p. 223 f.) would
explain the omissions by the suggestion that the right to have
names inscribed on a monument was earned not by fighting but by
contributing to the cost of the monument. But this view is contradicted 
by the heading of the Delphic inscription (<foreign rend="ital">sup.</foreign>) and by the
words of Thucydides (i. 132 <foreign rend="ital">sup.</foreign>), as well as by H.'s statement.
It is far more likely that states whose contingents were very small
were left out, unless, like the Tenians, they rendered signal service
(cf. viii. 82). Indeed, it would appear from the fact that the names
<pb n="323"/>
<figure/></p>
<p>N.B.&mdash;Those italicized in list 3 do not appear on either inscription; those in list 1 are
not found in list 2.</p>
<p>* indicates a marked difference in order from list 1.
<pb n="324"/>
of the Tenians and Siphnians are written irregularly, and in each
case make a fourth name on the coil, three being the usual number,
that these states were inserted later. The thirty-one names on the
Delphic tripod is the precise number given by Plutarch (Them. 20)
as fighting against Persia. Whether the four omissions in Pausanias
are due to faulty copying of the inscription at Olympia, or whether
here, too, the comparative insignificance of the contingents caused
the omissions, must remain doubtful. Domaszewski's explanation
(Neue Heidelberger Jahrb&uuml;cher, i. 181-7) of the arrangement as
three groups, (1) Tegea to Tiryns, Peloponnesian allies (Spartan);
(2) Plataea to Elis, Athenian allies; (3) Potidaea to Ambracia,
Corinthian colonies, is untenable, as neither Mycenaeans, Chalcidians, 
nor Eleans are specially Athenian allies, and the order is
different at Olympia. In both lists the compilers seem to have
been guided at once by the importance and services of the states,
and by geographical considerations, but they applied the principles
rather differently. Tegea, for instance, is put specially high on the
Delphic list because of the bravery of her hoplites at Plataea (cf.
ix. 61, 62, and 70; cf. also ix. 26); cf. in general Frazer on <bibl n="Paus. 9.13.9">Paus.

<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ἰρένας</lemma>. Iren is the term for a young Spartan between twenty and
thirty years of age. These youths had no part in the meetings of
the assembly and no right to a household of their own, but they
were free from the discipline of the boys, and were indeed expected
to inspire them by precept and example. They were also largely
employed on military service. But it is impossible that all the
Spartiates who won the highest distinction at Plataea were irens, and
in particular that Amompharetus, colonel of his regiment, with a voice
in the council of war (ch. 53, 55), should be so young a man. (This
has led Blakesley to suspect the clause <foreign lang="greek">ἔνθα μὲν . . . Καλλικράτης</foreign>.)
Again, the Lacedaemonians or Perioeci (ch. 11. 3) are left out in
H.'s scheme. It seems more likely that the first tomb contained all
the Spartiates (the majority of whom may have been irens; cf. ch. 12.

<p>The particular fact that the Aeginetan tomb was erected ten
years after the battle by Cleades, their proxenus (viii. 136. 1 n.) at
Plataea, is no doubt true enough, but the inference drawn by H. is
unfair. It is probable enough that there were many cenotaphs
erected later. Only where the dead fell thick and fast in a single
spot, as in the case of the states previously named (&sect; 2), could their
<pb n="326"/>
bones be gathered for burial. Those who fell in the earlier fighting,
or even in the skirmishing of the day just before (ch. 49, 52) the
battle, would be scattered over a wide area. In such cases it was
customary to set up a cenotaph in memory of the dead; there would
be no attempt at deception.</p></div3></div>

already Medizing, and so was glad to put Timagenidas out of the

children of Attaginus to conciliate their father, who was still at large.</p>
<p>But H. takes a simpler and more generous view of his action,

the great Heraeum is meant, as is shown by H.'s usage elsewhere
(i. 70. 3; iii. 123. 1; iv. 88. 1, 152. 4), and by the fact that no other

as the Ionians were untrustworthy (Meyer, iii, &sect; 238), and so sent
the Phoenician ships home to secure their safety. Delbr&uuml;ck (Perserkriege, 
p. 104) strangely ascribes their departure to over-confidence
caused by the long inaction of the Greek fleet, while Domaszewski
(Neue Heidelberger Jahrb&uuml;cher, i. 188) suggests that they may
have been sent to guard the coast of Thrace. Whether H. is right
in postponing the departure of the Phoenicians till the Greeks
reached Samos, or at least were sailing from Delos, is more doubtful
(Stein). Diodorus (xi. 19; cf. <ref target="c.8.130" targOrder="U">viii. 130 n.</ref>) seems to mean that they
sailed straight home from Salamis; at latest they must have gone

<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">φήμη</lemma>. As has been shown by Grote (v. 47 f.), the multitude in
all ages is subject to &lsquo;sudden unaccountable impressions&rsquo;, whether
of panic or encouragement, which in an age of faith are naturally
attributed to divine intervention. The <foreign lang="greek">φήμη</foreign> here is paralleled by
that in Aeschines (<bibl n="Aeschin. 1.128">in Timarch. &sect; 128</bibl> f. and <bibl n="Aeschin. 2.144">de Fals. Leg. &sect; 144</bibl> f.;

xxiv. 413</bibl>). If, however, we are to find any real foundation for the
report, we must either suppose with Grundy (p. 526) that it referred
to one of the earlier successes of the Greeks in Boeotia, e. g. the
death of Masistius, or we must give up the precise synchronism
between Plataea and Mycale (&sect; 2, ch. 101. 2). Either is better than
accepting the rationalizing suggestion of Ephorus (Diod. xi. 35;
Polyaen. i. 33) that Leotychides invented the report to encourage
his men, while the Persian generals told their troops that Xerxes
was coming to their aid with a large force. The traditional precise
synchronism between Plataea and Mycale (cf. Diod. xi. 34; Justin
ii. 14) is a little discredited by the similar record as to the Himera
and Salamis (vii. 166 n.), or the Himera and Thermopylae (Diod.
xi. 24). Further, though no exact chronology is possible, if Mardonius 
was at Athens in June (ch. 3 n.), the battle of Plataea probably
took place at the beginning of August (ch. 41. 1 n. and Busolt, ii.
725, n. 4). The dates in Plutarch, third Boedromion (Camill. 19,
Moral. 349 F) and twenty-sixth Panemos=Metageitnion (Aristid.
19), seem to be those on which the victory was celebrated at Athens
and at Plataea (cf. <ref target="c.6.106.3" targOrder="U">vi. 106. 3 n.</ref>). Mycale, on the other hand, is more
naturally placed in the middle of August (Busolt, ii. 742, n. 2), since
by the time that the Athenians have settled down to besiege Sestos
it is autumn, i. e. mid-September, ch. 117 n. A fortnight's interval

many islands to be included, e. g. Andros, Tenos, Paros, and
Carystus in Euboea (vii. 95 n.; viii. 66, 111 f.), and perhaps those

<p>The idea of evacuating Ionia had been suggested by Bias (i. 170),
and even partially carried out both in 546 B. C. (i. 164-8) and in
494 B. C. (vi. 17, 20). Hence there is nothing improbable in its
suggestion here. Possibly, too, it might be regarded as a military
measure within the competence of Leotychides and his council,
<pb n="333"/>
though a question of such far-reaching importance as the expulsion
of the Medizers should surely have been referred to the Probouloi
at the Isthmus. Diodorus (xi. 37), in saying that both Ionians and
Athenians at first agreed, and that the latter repented only when
the Ionians and Aeolians had made all their preparations to
emigrate, is guilty of foolish exaggeration, since the assent of the
Ionians is not in accord with their strong attachment to their native
land (cf. i. 165; vi. 3).</p></div3>
<div3 id="c.9.106.4" type="section" n="4">
<p>H. distinctly limits admission into the league to the islanders
present with the Greek fleet. We have already heard of the Chians
and Samians (viii. 132; ix. 90 f.), but the Lesbians are here first
mentioned. Presumably they had previously joined but H. omitted
their adhesion, just as he omits to mention the presence of allies as
well as Athenians at the siege of Sestos (ch. 114. 2 n.). The other
loyal islanders (enumerated in viii. 46 and n.) must have been long
before formally admitted to the league (cf. vii. 145). There is
a difficulty as to the position of the Greeks on the mainland. H.
here appears to exclude them, and in ch. 101 <foreign rend="ital">ad fin.</foreign> makes &lsquo;the
islands&rsquo; and the Hellespont the prize of victory, yet Ionia (in which
Miletus is included) has already &lsquo;revolted from Persia&rsquo; (ch. 104
<foreign rend="ital">ad fin.</foreign>), and, according to Thucydides (i. 89), allies from Ionia
and the Hellespont helped the Athenians to take Sestos, while
Ionians and others lately freed from the king are foremost in promoting 
the transference of the hegemony to Athens (i. 95). Diodorus
(xi. 37) cuts the knot by admitting to the league all Aeolians and
Ionians without distinction, which has led Steup to insert <foreign lang="greek">καὶ τοὺς
ἠπειρώτας</foreign> here. But Diodorus in this chapter is full of errors, and
it seems better to suppose that such Greeks of the mainland as
revolted from Persia were at first informally under the protection
of Athens, and that they were only granted a formal alliance later,
probably when the hegemony was transferred to Athens (cf. Busolt,
iii. 39, 40). Of course many Greek states in Asia remained subject
to Persia for years after this (cf. <ref target="c.6.42" targOrder="U">vi. 42 n.</ref>).</p>

it perhaps is intended to warn the conquerors that they too may
