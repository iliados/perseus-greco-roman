						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">Ἡ ῥητορική ἐστιν ἀντίστροφος τῇ διαλεκτικῆ</lemma> is translated by Cicero, <hi rend="italic">ex altera parte respondere dialecticae</hi>, Orat. XXXII 114. &lsquo;Vox a scena ducta videtur. Chori antistrophe strophae ad assem respondet, eiusque motus ita fit, ut posterior in prioris locum succedat...Significat ex altera parte respondere et quasi ex adverso oppositum esse; id quod etiam in antistrophen cadit.&rsquo; Trendel. <hi rend="italic">El. Log. Arist.</hi> &sect; 14 p. 74: and to the same effect, <hi rend="italic">Comment. ad Arist. de Anima</hi>, II 11 5 p. 408. &lsquo;<foreign lang="greek">ἀντίστροφον</foreign> dicitur quod alius rei quasi partes agit eamque repraesentat;&rsquo; Waitz, <hi rend="italic">Comm. ad Anal. Pr.</hi> I 2, 25 <hi rend="italic">a</hi> 6. </p>
						<p>The term is borrowed from the manoeuvres of the chorus in the recitation of the choral odes. <foreign lang="greek">Στροφή</foreign> denotes its movement in one direction, to which the <foreign lang="greek">ἀντιστροφή</foreign>, the counter-movement, the wheeling in the opposite direction, exactly corresponds, the same movements being repeated. M&uuml;ller, <hi rend="italic">Diss. Eumen.</hi> p. 41. <hi rend="italic">Hist. Gr. Lit.</hi> c. XIV &sect; 4. Mure, <hi rend="italic">Hist. Gk. Lit.</hi> Bk. III. c. 1 &sect; 15. Hence it is extended to the words sung by the chorus during the latter of these evolutions, and signifies a set of verses precisely parallel or answering in all their details to the verses of the <foreign lang="greek">στροφή</foreign>. And thus, when applied in its strict and proper sense, it denotes an exact correspondence in detail, as a fac-simile or counterpart. </p>
						<p>Hence in Logic <foreign lang="greek">ἀντιστρέφειν</foreign> is used to express terms and propositions which are <hi rend="italic">convertible</hi>, and therefore identical in meaning, precisely similar in all respects. On the various senses of <foreign lang="greek">ἀντιστρέφειν</foreign> and its derivatives in Logic, see Waitz, u. s. In this signification, however, <foreign lang="greek">ἀντίστροφος</foreign> does not properly represent the relation actually subsisting between the two arts, the differences between them being too numerous to admit of its being described as an exact correspondence in detail; as I have already pointed out in the paraphrase (Introd. p. 134). </p>
						<p>It also represents Rhetoric as an art, independent of, though analogous to, Dialectics, but not growing out of it, nor included under it. The word is of very frequent occurrence in Plato (Gorgias, Republic, Philebus, Timaeus, Theaetetus, Leges), who joins it indifferently with the genitive and dative; and he employs it in this latter sense; as likewise Isocrates, <foreign lang="greek">περὶ ἀντιδ</foreign>. &sect; 182; and Aristotle himself in several places; Polit. VI (IV) 5, 1292 <hi rend="italic">b</hi> 7, <foreign lang="greek">καὶ ἔστιν ἀντίστροφος</foreign> (corresponding) <pb n="2"/> <foreign lang="greek">αὕτη ἐν ταῖς ὀλιγαρχίαις ὥσπερ ἡ τυραννὶς ἐν ταῖς μοναρχίαις</foreign>. c. 6 ult. 1293 <hi rend="italic">a</hi> 33. c. 10, 1295 <hi rend="italic">a</hi> 18. de part. anim. II 17 ult. <foreign lang="greek">ἐν μὲν οὖν τούτοις τοῖς ζῴοις ἡ γλῶττα τοιαύτη τὴν φύσιν ἐστίν, ὥσπερ ἀντιστρόφως ἔχουσα τῷ μυκτῆρι τῶν ἐλεφάντων</foreign>. </p>
						<p>Lastly, Waitz, u. s., points out a peculiar signification of it, &lsquo;res contraria alteri quam potestate aequiparat,&rsquo; in de Gen. Anim. II 6, 743 <hi rend="italic">b</hi> 28. <foreign lang="greek">τὸ ψυχρὸν συνίστησιν ἀντίστροφον</foreign> (as a balance) <foreign lang="greek">τῇ θερμότητι τῇ περὶ τὴν καρδίαν τὸν ἐγκέφαλον</foreign>. Trendelenburg, <hi rend="italic">Comm. ad de Anima</hi> u. s., after defining <foreign lang="greek">ἀντιστρέφειν</foreign> as above, adds, <foreign lang="greek">ἀντίστροφος</foreign> ex eadem chori similitudine significat <hi rend="italic">ex altera parte respondere</hi> (this is from Cicero, u. s.) Arist. Rhet. I 1; quod non significat, rhetoricam in dialecticae locum succedere (<hi rend="italic">i.e.</hi> can be substituted for it, step into its place, as <hi rend="italic">a convertible term</hi>), sed quasi ex adverso esse oppositam (stands over against it, as a corresponding opposite in a <foreign lang="greek">συστοιχία</foreign>, two parallel rows of coordinate opposites, like the partners in a country dance). Quintilian, Inst. Orat. II 17, 42, <hi rend="italic">specie magis quam genere differunt.</hi> </p>
						<p>The term <foreign lang="greek">ἀντίστροφος</foreign> therefore applied to the two arts, seems to represent them as two coordinate opposites, or opposites in the same row (see Spengel on the study of Rhetoric, Munich 1842, p. 21). They are sister arts, with general resemblances and specific differences; two species under one genus, proof: both modes of proof, both dealing with probable materials, but distinguished by the difference of the two instruments of proof employed: the one <hi rend="italic">concluding</hi> by the formal svllogism, and by the regular induction, assumed complete; the other drawing its <hi rend="italic">inferences</hi> by the abbreviated, imperfect, conversational enthymeme, never complete in <hi rend="italic">form</hi>, and by the single example in the place of the general induction. </p>
						<p>Rhetoric is afterwards described as <foreign lang="greek">παραφυές, μόριον</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">ὁμοίωμα</foreign> (<hi rend="italic">infra</hi> c. II &sect; 7). <foreign lang="greek">παραφυές</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">μόριον</foreign> both express in different ways the relation that Rhetoric bears to Dialectics as the off-shoot, <hi rend="italic">branch</hi>, or part; a species or variety of the <hi rend="italic">general</hi> art of probable reasoning: <foreign lang="greek">παραφυές</foreign> as a subordinate shoot, growing out of the same root with the larger plant or tree,&mdash;a term so far corresponding with <foreign lang="greek">ἀντίστροφος</foreign>, but differing from it in making Rhetoric <hi rend="italic">subordinate.</hi> <foreign lang="greek">μόριον</foreign> reduces it to a still lower level in comparison with the other. <foreign lang="greek">ὁμοίωμα</foreign> implies no more than a mere general resemblance. </p>
						<p>In Sext. Empir. adv. Math. VII 6, occurs an explanation of <foreign lang="greek">ἀντίστροφος</foreign>, quite in character with the ordinary Greek etymologies, <foreign lang="greek">ῥητορικήν, ἧς ἀντίστροφον εἶναι τὴν διαλεκτικήν</foreign>, (not referring apparently to this passage, but most probably to the <foreign lang="greek">συναγωγὴ τεχνῶν</foreign>) <foreign lang="greek">τουτέστιν ἰσόστροφον, διὰ τὸ περὶ τὴν αὐτὴν ὕλην στρέφεσθαι</foreign> (<hi rend="italic">versari circa</hi>), as Homer called Ulysses <foreign lang="greek">ἀντίθεον</foreign> instead of <foreign lang="greek">ἰσόθεον</foreign>. Alexander (infr.) gives the same explanation. </p>
						<p>Bacon <hi rend="italic">Adv. of learning</hi> Bk. II IX 3, has <hi rend="italic">antistrophe</hi> for &lsquo;correspondence&rsquo;, &ldquo;and it hath the same relation or <hi rend="italic">antistrophe</hi> that the former hath.&rdquo; </p>
						<p>The points of correspondence and difference between the two arts have been already fully explained in the Introduction, p. 90 foll.: I will here give a summary of them from Alexander's <hi rend="italic">Commentary on the</hi> <pb n="3"/> <hi rend="italic">Topics</hi>, p. 4. They are 1. that both of them are <foreign lang="greek">μὴ περὶ ἕν τι γένος ἀφωρισμένον</foreign>; that is, that neither of them has any special subject-matter, like the sciences, but argues or perorates upon any thesis or subject whatsoever that can be presented to it. 2. <foreign lang="greek">τὸ δἰ ἐνδόξων καὶ πιθανῶν</foreign>, no proof or conclusion, or principle, that they employ is more than probable; exact demonstration and necessary conclusions are excluded from both alike; <foreign lang="greek">πίστις</foreign>, belief, the result of mere persuasion, and not <foreign lang="greek">ἐπιστήμη</foreign>, the infallible result of scientific demonstration, being the object aimed at. 3. <foreign lang="greek">μὴ δἰ οἰκείων ἀρχῶν</foreign>, they have no &lsquo;special, appropriate&rsquo; first principles, such as those from which the special sciences are deduced; though they likewise appeal to the <foreign lang="greek">τὰ κοινά</foreign>, the <foreign lang="greek">κοιναὶ ἀρχαί</foreign>, the ultimate axioms and principles common to all reasoning, which are above those of the special sciences, and from which the latter must be deduced. And, 4. they are <foreign lang="greek">ὁμοίως περὶ τὰ ἀντικείμενα ἀλλήλοις</foreign>; they argue indifferently the opposite sides of the same question, and conclude the positive or negative of any proposition or problem; unlike science and demonstration, which can only arrive at one conclusion. Where the materials and the method are alike only probable, every question has, or may be made to appear to have, two sides, either of which may be maintained on probable principles; in Dialectics and Rhetoric no certainty is either attained or attainable. The chief points of difference between them are, that Dialectics deals practically as well as theoretically with every kind of problem or question that can be submitted to it; proceeds by question and answer, in the way of debate, and its discussions are of a more general or universal character; whereas the subjects of Rhetoric are practically, though not theoretically, almost absolutely limited to Politics; it follows a method of continuous narration or explanation (<foreign lang="greek">διεξοδικῶς</foreign>), and deals in its conclusions rather with individual cases than with general principles or universal rules, maxims and axioms. </p>
						<p>Alexander, in a preceding passage, gives the following very extraordinary account of the derivation and original meaning of <foreign lang="greek">ἀντίστροφος</foreign>: <foreign lang="greek">τὸ γὰρ ἀντ. ἀντὶ τοῦ ἰσόστροφόν τε καὶ περὶ τὰ αὐτὰ στρεφομένην καὶ καταγινομένην λέγει</foreign>. </p>
						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">κοινὰ ἁπάντων</lemma>] See Introd., p. 87, and the Paraphrase, pp. 134&mdash;5. </p>
						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ἀφωρισμένης</lemma>] &lsquo;marked off, separated by a limit&rsquo;, from every thing else about it; and so &lsquo;definite, special&rsquo; (&sect; 7). 1, 2, 1 <foreign lang="greek">περί τι γένος ἴδιον ἀφωρισμένον</foreign>, opposed to <foreign lang="greek">περὶ τοῦ δοθέντος</foreign>. Polit. I 13, 1260 <hi rend="italic">b</hi> 1 <foreign lang="greek">ἀφωρισμένην τινὰ δουλείαν</foreign> (a definite, limited, kind of slavery). Ib. IV (VI) 4, 1290 <hi rend="italic">b</hi> 25 <foreign lang="greek">ἀποδιορίζειν. ἀφορίζεται</foreign> (<foreign lang="greek">ἡ τῆς ψυχῆς δύναμις</foreign>) <foreign lang="greek">πρὸς τὰς ἄλλας δυνάμεις τῷ ἔργῳ τούτῳ</foreign>, &ldquo;this capacity of the soul is marked off, separated, distinguished, from all the rest by this function,&rdquo; de Anima II 4, 9, 416 <hi rend="italic">a</hi> 20. The preposition is similarly used in the compound <foreign lang="greek">ἀποβλέπειν</foreign>, which is &lsquo;to look away, or off&rsquo;, from all surrounding objects, so as to fix the attention on one particular thing, or turn it in one particular direction. Comp. Lat. <hi rend="italic">de</hi>finire, <hi rend="italic">de</hi>terminare. </p>
						<p>Parallel passages, in which this same characteristic of Rhetoric and <pb n="4"/> Dialectics is noticed, are cited in the Introd. p. 75. See also Quintilian, II 21, 16&mdash;19, on the province of the orator. </p>
						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ἐξετάζειν...λόγον</lemma>] Note 1, Introd. p. 135. <foreign lang="greek">ἡ διαλεκτικὴ ἐξεταστική</foreign>, Top. A 2, 101 <hi rend="italic">b</hi> 3. </p>
					</div3>
					<div3 id="b1c1s2" type="section" n="2">
						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">συνήθειαν</lemma>] &lsquo;habituation, familiarity, practice&rsquo;, acquired by <hi rend="italic">association</hi> (prop. that of living or herding together). Top. A 14, 105 <hi rend="italic">b</hi> 27 <foreign lang="greek">τῇ διὰ τῆς ἀπαγωγῆς συνηθείᾳ πειρατέον γνωρίζειν ἑκάστην αὐτῶν</foreign> (<foreign lang="greek">τῶν προτάσεων</foreign>). See also on I 10, 18. This <foreign lang="greek">συνήθεια</foreign> is derived from the constant operation or activity, the <foreign lang="greek">ἐνέργειαι</foreign>, of the developed and acquired and settled <foreign lang="greek">ἕξις</foreign>, or mental state (<foreign lang="greek">ἕξις</foreign> from <foreign lang="greek">ἔχειν</foreign>, &lsquo;to be in such and such a state or condition&rsquo;, <foreign lang="greek">τὸ πῶς ἔχειν</foreign>): by the constant exercise of the <foreign lang="greek">ἕξις</foreign>, or established confirmed habit, and its <foreign lang="greek">ἐνέργειαι</foreign>, is produced by association that familiarity, or habituation, or practice, which secures success even to the empirical unartistic use of Dialectics or Rhetoric. </p>
						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">εἰκῇ ταῦτα δρᾷν</lemma> is the use of them antecedent to practice, and without previously acquired familiarity: <foreign lang="greek">ἀπὸ ταὐτομάτου</foreign>, by a mere spontaneous impulse, and therefore &lsquo;at random.&rsquo; </p>
						<p>&lsquo;Est autem dialectica,&rsquo; says John of Salisbury, <hi rend="italic">Metalogicus</hi>, II 4, &lsquo;ut Augustino placet, bene disputandi scientia: quod quidem ita accipiendum est ut vis habeatur in verbis; ne scilicet dialectici credantur, quos casus iuvat artis beneficio destitutos.&rsquo; </p>
						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">αὐτά</lemma>] Rhetoric and its processes. </p>
						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ὁδοποιεῖν</lemma>] &lsquo;to make a way&rsquo;; to trace a path to be followed, which will lead you without unnecessary deviations to the place at which you wish to arrive. <foreign lang="greek">ὁδός</foreign> therefore, in this metaphorical usage, is not merely <hi rend="italic">a</hi> way, but <hi rend="italic">the</hi> way, the <hi rend="italic">best</hi> way; the way which will lead you most surely and expeditiously to the end proposed. Hence it denotes a regular, systematic, or scientific method; the best and easiest way of attaining the end desired in any intellectual pursuit or branch of study. And thus it is that the simple <foreign lang="greek">ὁδός</foreign>, as well as the compound <foreign lang="greek">μέθοδος</foreign>, come to denote a scientific or systematic procedure in the pursuit of truth as a philosophical &lsquo;method&rsquo;, or in any art or study. Hence we find <foreign lang="greek">ὁδῷ διῃρῆσθαι</foreign>, Plat. Phaedr. 263 B, of a systematic methodical scientific division; and Rep. VII 533 D: <foreign lang="greek">καθ’  ὁδόν</foreign>, in the same sense, Rep. IV 435 A, and Crat. 425 B. In Aristotle, de gen. et corr. I 8, 2 <foreign lang="greek">ὁδῷ δὲ μάλιστα περὶ πάντων...διωρίκασι Λεύκιππος καὶ Δημόκριτος</foreign>. de part. Anim. 14, 9 <foreign lang="greek">πῶς μὲν οὖν ἀποδέχεσθαι δεῖ τὴν περὶ φύσεως μέθοδον, καὶ τίνα τρόπον γένοιτ’  ἂν ἡ θεωρία περὶ αὐτῶν ὁδῷ καὶ ῥᾷστα</foreign>... Anal. Pr. I 30 init., <foreign lang="greek">ἡ μὲν οὖν ὁδὸς κατὰ πάντων ἡ αὐτὴ καὶ περὶ φιλοσοφίαν καὶ περὶ τέχνην ὁποιανοῦν καὶ μάθημα</foreign>. Top. B 2, 109 <hi rend="italic">b</hi> 14 <foreign lang="greek">ὁδῷ γὰρ μᾶλλον καὶ ἐν ἐλάττοσιν ἡ σκέψις</foreign>. Eth. Nic. I, 2 <foreign lang="greek">ἀπὸ τῶν ἀρχῶν ἢ ἐπὶ</foreign> <pb n="5"/> <foreign lang="greek">τὰς ἀρχὰς ἡ ὁδός</foreign>. Dionysius, de Comp. Verb. c. 25, has <foreign lang="greek">ἡ ῥητορικὴ ὁδός</foreign> for the more usual <foreign lang="greek">μέθοδος</foreign>: and again <foreign lang="greek">ὁδῷ</foreign>, de Comp. Verb. c. 4 sub fin. From this usage of the Greek word the Latins seem to have borrowed their <hi rend="italic">via</hi> or <hi rend="italic">via et ratione</hi>, which frequently occurs in precisely the same sense. See Cicero de Fin. III 5, 18, IV 4, 10; Orat. III 10, XXXIII 116; de Orat. I 25, 113. Quint. II 17, 41 <hi rend="italic">esse certe viam atque ordinem in bene dicendo nemo dubitaverit;</hi> and x 7, 6 <hi rend="italic">via dicere.</hi> </p>
						<p>The verb <foreign lang="greek">ὁδοποιεῖν</foreign> is found in the same sense, Met. A 3, 984 <hi rend="italic">a</hi> 18. <foreign lang="greek">προϊόντων δ’  οὕτως, αὐτὸ τὸ πρᾶγμα ὡδοποίησεν αὐτοῖς καὶ συνηνάγκασε ζητεῖν</foreign>, and Rhet. III 12, 3 (according to MS A^{c} and some others); and the substantive <foreign lang="greek">ὁδοποίησις</foreign>, III 14, 1. </p>
						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">προοδοποιεῖν</lemma>, which occurs several times in Aristotle (as Rhet. II 2, 10, II 13, 7, III 12, 3, Prob. XXX 1, 954 <hi rend="italic">b</hi> 12, de part. Anim. II 4, &sect;&sect; 4, 5, 6, III 9, 8, de gen. anim. IV 4, 9, <foreign lang="greek">περὶ Μαντικῆς</foreign>, I 11. Polit. II 9, 1270 <hi rend="italic">a</hi> 4, IV (VII) 17, 1336 <hi rend="italic">a</hi> 32, and V (VIII) 3, 1338 <hi rend="italic">a</hi> 35 <foreign lang="greek">πρὸ ὁδοῦ</foreign>), has a meaning slightly differing from the preceding. The metaphor is now taken from the office of pioneers, who precede an advancing army, and prepare, clear, or &lsquo;pave the way&rsquo; for them. </p>
						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">δἰ ὅ...τὴν αἰτίαν] τὴν αἰτίαν</lemma> is here grammatically the antecedent to <foreign lang="greek">ὅ</foreign>, the cause, <foreign lang="greek">αἰτία</foreign>, being in the relative pronoun expressed as an abstract notion (&lsquo;the cause, which <hi rend="italic">thing</hi>&rsquo;) in the <hi rend="italic">neuter.</hi> A similar change from feminine to neuter, in antecedent and relative, occurs in de Anima 1 3, 407 <hi rend="italic">a</hi> 4 <foreign lang="greek">τὴν γὰρ τοῦ παντὸς</foreign> (<foreign lang="greek">ψυχὴν</foreign>) <foreign lang="greek">τοιαύτην εἶναι βούλεται οἷόν ποτ’  ἐστὶν ὁ καλούμενος νοῦς</foreign>, Pol. II 2 init. <foreign lang="greek">καὶ δἰ ἣν αἰτίαν φησὶ δεῖν νενομοθετῆσθαι... οὐ φαίνεται συμβαῖνον ἐκ τῶν λόγων</foreign>, and in Eur. Iph. T. 900 (Herm.) <foreign lang="greek">ἡ δ’  αἰτία τίς ἀνθ̓ ὅτου κτείνει πόσιν</foreign>; where <foreign lang="greek">ὅτου</foreign> must be understood as neuter: see Hermann on v. 1038. </p>
					</div3>
					<div3 id="b1c1s3" type="section" n="3">
						<p>seq. To the same effect III 14, 8 <foreign lang="greek">δεῖ δὲ μὴ λανθάνειν ὅτι πάντα ἔξω τοῦ λόγου τὰ τοιαῦτα· πρὸς φαῦλον γὰρ ἀκροατὴν καὶ τὰ ἔξω τοῦ πράγματος ἀκούοντα, ἐπεὶ ἂν μὴ τοιοῦτος ᾖ, οὐθὲν δεῖ προοιμίου</foreign>&mdash;as the vehicle for appeals to the feelings and other indirect proofs addressed to the judges personally, which were usually introduced into the <foreign lang="greek">προοίμιον</foreign>. </p>
						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">πίστεις</lemma>] <hi rend="italic">rhetorical</hi>, not demonstrative, proofs; modes of <hi rend="italic">belief</hi>, of things <hi rend="italic">probable;</hi> all the materials and arguments of Rhetoric being probable merely, none of them certain. See Introd. p. 136 note. </p>
						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">προσθῆκαι...σῶμα τῆς πίστεως</lemma>] All kinds of <hi rend="italic">indirect</hi> proof are secondary, subordinate, non-essential, mere &lsquo;adjuncts&rsquo; or &lsquo;appendages&rsquo;, like dress or ornaments to the body: &lsquo;the body&rsquo; being the actual, logical, direct and substantial proof of the case. What is here called &lsquo;the body&rsquo;, meaning <pb n="6"/> the substance as opposed to accidents, we usually represent by &lsquo;the soul&rsquo; in this same relation; the body in its turn now standing for the accidents and non-essentials of a thing. So the Scholiast on Hermogenes, Proleg. (quoted by Ernesti, <hi rend="italic">Lexicon Technologiae Graecae</hi> p. 110, Art. <foreign lang="greek">ἐνθύμημα</foreign>) <foreign lang="greek">οἱ παλαιοὶ ὥσπερ τι ζῷον τὸν λόγον ὑπέθεντο ἐκ σώματός τε συνεστηκότα καὶ ψυχῆς· ψυχὴν μὲν καλοῦντες τὰ ἐνθυμήματα καὶ τὴν δύναμιν τὴν διὰ τῶν κεφαλαίων συνισταμένην· σῶμα δὲ τὴν φράσιν καὶ τὸ ἔξωθεν κάλλος, ὃ ποιεῖν εἰώθασιν αἱ ἰδέαι</foreign>. And Cicero, Orat. XIV 44 <hi rend="italic">nam et invenire et iudicare quid dicas magna illa quidem sunt et tamquam animi instar in corpore.</hi> </p>
						<p>Quintilian describes the views of some of those who thus rigorously limit the province of Rhetoric as an <hi rend="italic">art</hi>&mdash;<foreign lang="greek">αἱ πίστεις ἔντεχνόν ἐστι μόνον</foreign>&mdash; to the employment of the &lsquo;enthymeme&rsquo;, the rhetorical representative of the logical and demonstrative &lsquo;syllogism&rsquo;; with the exclusion of all that is, strictly speaking, &lsquo;beside the subject or real issue&rsquo;, all that is beside the facts of the case and the direct proof of them; all indirect proof, namely, from the assumed character of the speaker himself, or appeals to the feelings of the judges or audience, and also all ornaments and graces of style and delivery. Aristotle here assumes this to be theoretically the only true and proper method, though he by no means consistently adheres to it in his actual treatment of the subject. Quintilian's description is as follows, though, as the reasons for the exclusion of these indirect proofs are somewhat different from those assigned by Aristotle, he probably does not refer immediately to him: <hi rend="italic">Fuerunt et clari quidem oratores quibus solum videretur oratoris officium</hi> docere. <hi rend="italic">Namque et affectus duplici ratione excludendos putabant: primum quia vitium esset omnis animi perturbatio; deinde quia iudicem a veritate depelli misericordia vel ira similibusque non oporteret: et voluptatem audientium pctere, quum vincendi tantum gratia diceretur, non modo agenti supervacuum sed vix etiam viro dignum arbitrabantur.</hi> Inst. Orat. V. Prooem. I. </p>
						<p>On the general question of appeals to the feelings, Quint. II 17, 26 seq.: and on the prevailing practice, Isocr. <foreign lang="greek">περὶ ἀντιδ</foreign>. &sect; 321. </p>
						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">πραγματεύεσθαι</lemma> is well explained by Bonitz on Metaph. A 6, 987 <hi rend="italic">a</hi> 30. &lsquo;<foreign lang="greek">πραγματεύεσθαι περί τι</foreign>, vel <foreign lang="greek">περί τινος</foreign> is dicitur ab Aristotele, qui in investiganda et cognoscenda aliqua re via ac ratione procedit; itaque coniunctum legitur cum verbis <foreign lang="greek">διαλέγεσθαι, ζητεῖν, θεωρεῖν</foreign>&rsquo;. The primary sense of doing business, or occupying oneself about anything, passes into the more limited or special signification of an <hi rend="italic">intellectual</hi> pursuit, and thence of &lsquo;a special study&rsquo;, &lsquo;a systematic treatment of a particular subject of investigation, or practice&rsquo; (as in this present case, of Rhetoric, comp. &sect; 10). <foreign lang="greek">πραγματεία</foreign>, like <foreign lang="greek">μέθοδος, τέχνη, ἐπιστήμη, φιλοσοφία</foreign>, and many other words, is used to express not only the intellectual process of investigation, but also the resulting science, art, treatise, or written work, or part of such work. See on this point, Introd. p. 17, note 2. Also, on the general meaning of the term, Waitz on Anal. Post. II 13, 96 <hi rend="italic">b</hi> 15. Trendel. <hi rend="italic">de Anima</hi> p. 199. <hi rend="italic">Elem. Log. Arist.</hi> &sect; 58, p. 135. </p>

						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">διαβολή</lemma> from <foreign lang="greek">διαβάλλειν</foreign> &lsquo;to sunder or set at variance&rsquo;, and so <pb n="7"/> &lsquo;to make hostile, to engender a mutual dislike between two parties&rsquo;, in its technical application to Rhetoric, of which it is a potent instrument; and with its opposite <foreign lang="greek">ἀπολύεσθαι</foreign> &lsquo;to absolve oneself, clear away from oneself ill-feeling and suspicion&rsquo;, forms one of the principal topics of the <foreign lang="greek">προοίμιον</foreign> (see Introd. pp. 343, 4). It denotes the exciting of suspicion and ill-will in the minds of the judges or audience, in order to prejudice them against the opponent with whom you are in controversy: and is therefore improperly classed with the <foreign lang="greek">πάθη</foreign> or emotions such as <foreign lang="greek">ἔλεος</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">ὀργή</foreign>. This has been already noticed by Victorius and Muretus: the latter says, &lsquo;<foreign lang="greek">διαβολὴ</foreign> non est <foreign lang="greek">πάθος</foreign>, sed pertinet ad iudicem ponendum <foreign lang="greek">ἐν πάθει</foreign>.&rsquo; </p>

Spalding in his note on the first of these passages calls attention to&mdash;what indeed is sufficiently apparent on the face of the statements&mdash;Quintilian's carelessness in extending to all the lawcourts of Athens, a practice actually prevailing at the most only in one of them; in spite of the direct evidence to the contrary in the extant orations of the Athenian orators, and the story of Hyperides and Phryne which he himself tells in II 15, 9. </p>
						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">διαστρέφειν</lemma>] to warp, or distort to wrest out of the straight (&lsquo;right&rsquo;) line or proper direction, to pervert or &lsquo;deprave&rsquo; the judgment. The same metaphor is repeated in <foreign lang="greek">στρεβλόν</foreign>. The metaphor which compares wrong, the deviation from the &lsquo;right&rsquo; line or path, to the crooked or twisted, the divergence from the straight, and represents wrong judgment as the warping of the moral rule, occurs in various languages; <foreign lang="greek">σκολιός</foreign>, and <foreign lang="greek">ὀρθός, εὐθύνει δὲ δίκας σκολιάς</foreign>, Solon ap. Dem. de F. L. p. 423, <foreign lang="greek">σκολιαῖς ὁδοῖς πατῶν</foreign>, Pind. Pyth. II 156, Pl. Theaet. 173 A &amp;c. &amp;c. So <foreign lang="greek">ἑλικτός</foreign>, Eur.

						<p>&lsquo;Crooked&rsquo; for perverse, immoral, wrong, is very common in the earlier writers of our own language. Deut. xxxii 5, a perverse and crooked generation. Ps. cxxv 5, Prov. ii 15, whose ways are crooked, and they froward in their paths. Ep. ad Phil. ii 15, and in many other places and authors. For examples of the latter, see Richardson's Dict. Art. &lsquo;crooked&rsquo;. </p>
						<p>Very different to this are the principles laid down by the author of <pb n="9"/> the <foreign lang="greek">pητορικὴ πρὸς Ἀλέξανδρον</foreign> as a guide to the practice of the rhetorician, c. 36 (37) &sect; 4. <foreign lang="greek">χρὴ δὲ καὶ τοὺς δικαστὰς ἐπαίνῳ θεραπεῦσαι, ὡς δικασταὶ δίκαιοι καὶ δεινοί εἰσιν. συμπαραληπτέον δὲ καὶ τὰς ἐλαττώσεις, εἴ που τῶν ἀντιδίκων καταδεεστέρως ἔχει πρὸς τὸ λέγειν ἢ πράττειν ἢ ἄλλο τι πρὸς τὸν ἀγῶνα</foreign>. The judges are to be flattered, and the opponent represented in the darkest colours, whether his alleged defects have or have not any bearing upon the matter at issue. <foreign lang="greek">πρὸς δὲ τούτοις ἐμβλητέον τό τε δίκαιον καὶ τὸ νόμιμον καὶ τὸ συμφέρον καὶ τὰ τούτοις ἀκόλουθα</foreign>; which is the exact contradictory of the course prescribed by Aristotle in &sect; 6 as alike fair and in accordance with the true principles of the art. </p>

						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">κἂν εἴ τις...ποιήσειε</lemma>] The process by which <foreign lang="greek">ἄν</foreign> in this and similar forms of expression&mdash;<foreign lang="greek">ὡς ἂν εἰ, ὥσπερ ἂν εἰ, καθάπερ ἂν εἰ, οἱόνπερ ἂν εἰ</foreign>, and the like&mdash;has lost its force, become inactive, (<hi rend="italic">consopitum</hi>, &lsquo;gone to sleep&rsquo;, Buttm.,) in the sentence, is explained by Buttmann in his note on Dem. Mid. &sect; 15, p. 530. The conditional <foreign lang="greek">ἄν</foreign> belongs to some verb in the apodosis, originally expressed, afterwards left to be understood, as in the clause before us. The expression at full length would be, <foreign lang="greek">κἂν, εἴ τις ποιήσειε, ποιήσειε</foreign>, &lsquo;as one would do, if he were to do&rsquo;. Still, though the particle has lost its direct and active force in this sentence, some latent notion of conditionality always remains, even when the verb which <foreign lang="greek">ἂν</foreign> supposes cannot actually be supplied. This is the case in such phrases as <foreign lang="greek">φοβούμενος ὥσπερ ἂν εἰ παῖς</foreign>, Pl. Gorg. 479 A &lsquo;fearing as a child would&rsquo;: Ar. parva naturalia <foreign lang="greek">περὶ μαντικῆς</foreign> I 2, 2 <foreign lang="greek">ὅσων ὥσπερ ἂν εἰ λάλος ἡ φύσις ἐστιν</foreign>, &lsquo;whose natural habit is, as it might be (<foreign lang="greek">ἄν</foreign>), talkative&rsquo;; de Anima I 5, 5, 409 <hi rend="italic">b</hi> 27, <foreign lang="greek">ὥσπερ ἂν εἰ τὴν ψυχὴν τὰ πράγματα τιθέντες</foreign>. In such cases the <foreign lang="greek">ἄν</foreign> is retained by habit and association, when the sense no longer requires it. The phrase accordingly is not found in the earlier forms of the language, and does not become common till the time of Plato and Aristotle, with whom, the latter especially, it is very frequent. The association required time before it was established as a fixed habit. I believe that it does not occur in Thucydides, and that it makes its first appearance in Xenophon; that is, in the forms above given; for as an unnecessary appendage to a participle, or in cases <hi rend="italic">analogous</hi>, <foreign lang="greek">ἄν</foreign> is thus used by earlier writers. See Hermann on Soph. Phil. 491, and Jelf, <hi rend="italic">Gr. Gr.</hi> &sect; 430, I, for some instances [K&uuml;hner's <hi rend="italic">Ausf&uuml;hrliche Grammatik</hi> &sect; 398 p. 209 sq. S.]. </p>
						<p>Aristotle seems to be the earliest writer who assumed the license of joining <foreign lang="greek">κἂν εἰ</foreign> with the subjunctive mood, as in Pol. II 1 init. <foreign lang="greek">κἂν εἰ τυγχάνωσιν</foreign>, c. 2, <foreign lang="greek">ὥσπερ ἂν εἰ σταθμῆς πλεῖον ἑλκύσῃ</foreign>, and III 8 <foreign lang="greek">κἂν εἰ συμβαίνῃ</foreign>, also Poet. I 5, <foreign lang="greek">κἂν εἴ τινες ἕτεραι τυγχάνωσιν. Κἂν εἰ μή τῳ δοκῇ</foreign> is the MSS reading in Plat. Rep. IX 579 D, and defended by Schneider (not. ad loc.); but rejected by Ast, Bek., Stallb. and the Zurich Editors who substitute <foreign lang="greek">δοκεῖ</foreign>. I subjoin a few examples of the usage in its various forms. Soph. Aj. 1078 <foreign lang="greek">δοκεῖν πεσεῖν ἂν κἂν</foreign> (it might be even) <foreign lang="greek">ἀπὸ σμικροῦ κακοῦ</foreign>. Xenophon, Symp. II 20, IX 4, Cyrop. I 3, 1, Memor. III 6, 4 and 10, 12. Plato, Apol. 23 B, Phaed. 72 C, 109 C, and elsewhere, Men. 97 B, Gorg. 479 A, Rep. VI 493 A, Isocr. Paneg. &sect;&sect; 69, 148, Aristotle in addition to <pb n="10"/> those already quoted, Rhet. II 20, 4, <foreign lang="greek">ὥσπερ ἂν εἴ τις</foreign>, Eth. N. v 7, 1132, II. Ib. V 12, 1137, 2; VI 13 sub. fin., 1145, 2 and 10; VII 8, 1150, 16, <foreign lang="greek">κἂν εἰ ῥέπουσι</foreign>, Pol.

In Aristotle it has become habitual. The analogous use of <foreign lang="greek">ἂν</foreign> with the participle is exemplified by Pol. II 2, 1261 <hi rend="italic">b</hi> 4 <foreign lang="greek">ὥσπερ ἂν ἄλλοι γενόμενοι;</foreign> and Theophrastus, Hist. Plant. I 5, 1, <foreign lang="greek">ὡς ἄν καθόλου λέγοντας</foreign>, and I 6, 6, <foreign lang="greek">ὡς ἂν κατὰ λόγον</foreign>, where <foreign lang="greek">ἄν</foreign> may be considered as redundant. [Vahlen, <hi rend="italic">Beitr&auml;ge zu Ar. Poet.</hi> I p. 35&mdash;37; Eucken, <hi rend="italic">de Ar. dicendi ratione</hi> I p. 61&mdash;64. S.] </p>

By the Scholiast on Arist. Nub. 145, in Suidas v. <foreign lang="greek">ἀρτί</foreign> (Gaisf.), <foreign lang="greek">ἐξ ὑπογυίου λέγειν</foreign> is interpreted by <foreign lang="greek">αὐτοσχεδιάζειν</foreign>; and in Eustath. (ap. eund.) it is said to be derived from <foreign lang="greek">γυῖον</foreign> in the sense of <foreign lang="greek">χείρ</foreign>, (compare Theocr. Idyl. XXII 81 and 121; the &lsquo;hand&rsquo; is <hi rend="italic">the</hi> member, <hi rend="italic">par excellence</hi>), from which likewise he deduces <foreign lang="greek">ἐγγύη, ἐγγυᾷν</foreign>, and <foreign lang="greek">ἐγγυαλίζειν</foreign>; and <foreign lang="greek">ὑπόγυον, ὃ καὶ ἐξ ὑπογύου λέγεται, τὸ ἐγγύς φασι προσδόκιμον, ἢ παραυτίκα γεγονός, καὶ ὡς εἰπεῖν πρόχειρον, ἢ μᾶλλον ὑποχείριον</foreign>. Examples may be found, all bearing much the same sense, in Koch's note on Moeris Lex. p. 343, and a still larger list in Rost and Palm's Lex. s.v., to which add Rhet. II 22, 11; Pol. VII (VI) 8, 1321 <hi rend="italic">b</hi> 17. <foreign lang="greek">ὑπογυιότατον</foreign> (the readiest way or means) <foreign lang="greek">πρὸς αὐτάρκειαν</foreign>. Isocr. Paneg. &sect; 13.

Eth. Nic. III 9 (Bekk.) sub fin., <foreign lang="greek">ὅσα θάνατον ἐπιφέρει ὑπογυῖα ὄντα</foreign>. </p>
						<p>It appears from all this that <foreign lang="greek">ὑπογυῖον</foreign> means &lsquo;under the hand&rsquo;, as an unfinished or just finished work, fresh and recent, <foreign lang="greek">πρόσφατον</foreign> (so Rhet. II 3, 12) as Moeris explains it: and <foreign lang="greek">ἐξ ὑπογυίου</foreign>, &lsquo;from under the hand&rsquo;, corresponds to our &lsquo;off-hand&rsquo;, or &lsquo;out of hand&rsquo;, and is used to express anything &lsquo;sudden and unexpected&rsquo; or &lsquo;unpremeditated&rsquo;, &lsquo;extemporaneous&rsquo; a signification which appears in all the examples. Similarly <foreign lang="greek">ἐκ χειρός, ἀπὸ χειρο&lt;&gt;ς</foreign>, &lsquo;off-hand&rsquo;. </p>
						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ἀποδιδόναι</lemma>] a word of <hi rend="italic">very</hi> frequent use in Aristotle, has for one of its elementary senses that of &lsquo;to give back&rsquo;, <hi rend="italic">reddere;</hi> <foreign lang="greek">ἀπό</foreign> as in <foreign lang="greek">ἀπονέμειν, ἀπολαμβάνειν, ἀπαιτεῖν, ἀπόπλους, ἀποπλεῖν</foreign> (see Sturz. Lex. Xenoph.), from which all the other senses in which at least Aristotle employs it may be deduced. Another of the original senses of the word is &lsquo;to give forth&rsquo;, or &lsquo;produce&rsquo;, as the earth produces her fruits, and this also <hi rend="italic">might</hi> be applied to the interpretation of it in several of its various uses. But as this signification is likewise deducible from the other&mdash;for production, as <pb n="12"/> when the earth produces her fruits, may be regarded as a payment or restoration, or &lsquo;return&rsquo; of something <hi rend="italic">as due</hi>&mdash;it may perhaps be better to refer them all to the one original signification, <hi rend="italic">reddere.</hi> So in Eth. N. II 1, 1103, <hi rend="italic">a</hi> 27, <hi rend="italic">b</hi> 22, <foreign lang="greek">τὰς ἐνεργείας ἀποδιδόναι</foreign> is not simply &lsquo;to produce&rsquo;, but to produce energies that are <hi rend="italic">due to the system</hi>, energies <hi rend="italic">corresponding</hi> to the faculties from which they spring. So Trendelenburg, <hi rend="italic">El. Log. Arist.</hi> &sect; 55, p. 132, &lsquo;<foreign lang="greek">ἀποδιδόναι</foreign> proprie est reddere, unde ex suum cuique tribuendi significatione facile orta est declarandi vis (<hi rend="italic">declarare</hi> is the sense which the word bears in the passage specially referred to, Top. A 5, 102 <hi rend="italic">a</hi> 3) nihil enim est aliud quam logice suam cuique naturam reddere.&rsquo; </p>
						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ἀποδιδόναι</lemma> is therefore (1) to give back, restore, repay, render, always implying some kind of obligation, (2) to render <hi rend="italic">as a due</hi>, &lsquo;assign&rsquo; (which best represents it in the majority of cases in Aristotle); of <hi rend="italic">due</hi> distribution, <hi rend="italic">suum cuique;</hi> hence (3) of the due fulfilment of any office or duty, as <foreign lang="greek">ἀποδιδόναι λόγον</foreign>, &lsquo;to <hi rend="italic">render</hi> an account&rsquo;, to explain, or set forth, any statement or doctrine, <foreign lang="greek">ἀποφαίνεσθαι</foreign>, <hi rend="italic">declarare.</hi> To one or the other of these I believe all the multifarious uses of the word may be referred. </p>
						<p>I will add a few examples in the way of illustration:&mdash;Dem. c. Aristocr. p. 638 &sect; 56, <foreign lang="greek">τοὺς ἐχθρὰ ποιοῦντας ἐν ἐχθροῦ μέρει κολάζειν ἀπέδωκεν</foreign> (assigns as a due) <foreign lang="greek">ὁ νόμος</foreign>; and elsewhere. Plat. Phaed. 71 E (a good example), <foreign lang="greek">οὐκ ἀνταποδώσομεν τὴν ἐναντίαν γένεσιν</foreign> (pay back in return), <foreign lang="greek">ἀλλὰ ταύτῃ χωλὴ</foreign> (mutilated, defective, lopsided, single where all the rest are pairs) <foreign lang="greek">ἔσται ἡ φύσις; ἢ ἀνάγκη ἀποδοῦναι κ.τ.λ.</foreign> de Anima I 1, 403 <hi rend="italic">b</hi> 1, <foreign lang="greek">τούτων δὲ ὁ μὲν τὴν ὕλην ἀποδίδωσιν</foreign>, &lsquo;assigns&rsquo; or &lsquo;applies&rsquo;, that is, to the definition, which is the thing in question, to which it assigns matter as the sole element: comp. c. 4, 408 <hi rend="italic">a</hi> 3; and <foreign lang="greek">ἀπονέμειν</foreign>, in precisely the same sense, ib. V 1, and Pl. Tim. 34 A. <foreign lang="greek">ἀποδιδῶσι</foreign> make to correspond, bring into comparison, Rhet. III 11, 13. <foreign lang="greek">ἀποδ. λειτουργίαν</foreign> de part. An. III 14, 9, &lsquo;duly to fulfil certain functions (services)&rsquo;. Ib. II 14, 5, (<foreign lang="greek">ἡ φύσις</foreign>) <foreign lang="greek">πανταχοῦ ἀποδίδωσι</foreign> (makes due compensation, duly assigns) <foreign lang="greek">λαβοῦσα ἑτέρωθεν πρὸς ἄλλο μόριον</foreign>. Top. <foreign lang="greek">Δ</foreign> 1, 121 <hi rend="italic">a</hi> 15, et passim, <foreign lang="greek">τὸ ἀποδοθὲν γένος, ἀποδιδόναι γένος</foreign>. Top. A 18, 108 <hi rend="italic">b</hi> 9, <foreign lang="greek">τὴν ἀπόδοσιν τῶν ὁρισμῶν</foreign>, the rendering, or due preparation, production, of definitions: and so elsewhere. de part. An. III 7, 18, <foreign lang="greek">ἀποδ. τὸ ἔργον</foreign> of the due performance of the work. Ib. I 1, 43 <foreign lang="greek">ἀποδ. τὸ ὀστοῦν τί ἐστι</foreign>, to state, give a sufficient account or explanation. Phys. I 6, 1, 189 <hi rend="italic">a</hi> 16, <foreign lang="greek">Ἐμπεδοκλῆς πάντα ἀποδιδόναι</foreign> (to produce, effect everything) <foreign lang="greek">οἴεται ὅσαπερ Ἀναξ. ἐκ τῶν ἀπείρων</foreign>. Eth. Nic. III 1, 110 <hi rend="italic">b</hi> 8, <foreign lang="greek">ποῖα δὲ...οὐ ῥάδιον ἀποδοῦναι</foreign>, to give an account, explain. </p>
						<p>So here <foreign lang="greek">ἀποδιδόναι</foreign> is &lsquo;duly to assign, distribute, or apportion&rsquo; and again I 2, 5, <foreign lang="greek">ἀποδίδομεν τὰς κρίσεις</foreign> &lsquo;we render our judgments&rsquo;. These same applications of the word occur likewise in Plato, as Rep. 379 A, (to represent), Ib. 472 D, VI 508 E, Phaedr. 237 C, Theaet. 175 D, Polit. 295 A. The precise opposite, <foreign lang="greek">ἀπολαμβάνειν</foreign>, occurs with the same sense of <foreign lang="greek">ἀπό</foreign>, I 11, 3. <foreign lang="greek">ἀπονέμειν</foreign> is used in exactly the same sense, &lsquo;to assign as a due&rsquo;; see for instance Eth. Nic. IV 7, 1123 <hi rend="italic">b</hi> 18, <foreign lang="greek">ὁ τοῖς θεοῖς ἀπονέμομεν</foreign>, Ib. V 35, <foreign lang="greek">τιμὴ ἀπονέμεται τοῖς ἀγαθοῖς</foreign>, Ib. 1124 <hi rend="italic">a</hi> 9. <pb n="13"/> </p>
						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ἤδη...κρίνουσιν</lemma>] by this time, now that we have come to <hi rend="italic">them</hi>, &lsquo;<hi rend="italic">they actually</hi> decide&rsquo; So in the next line, <foreign lang="greek">τὸ φιλεῖν ἤδη καὶ τὸ μισεῖν</foreign> &lsquo;this time&rsquo;, in <hi rend="italic">their</hi>case, <hi rend="italic">not</hi> in the former, of something new, special, and <hi rend="italic">marked.</hi> <foreign lang="greek">ἤδη</foreign> therefore in these cases is often translatable by a mere emphasis. The word is repeated so soon after, applied to the same persons, and expressing almost identically the same thing, that it is not improbable that Spengel may be right in his conjecture that the one or the other should be erased. <hi rend="italic">Rhet. Gr.</hi> Vol. I. Pref. p. v. &lsquo;paulo post alterutrum <foreign lang="greek">ἤδη</foreign> abundat, puto prius.&rsquo; However there are two still closer together, II 25, 14. </p>
						<p>It may be worth while to say a few words on this very common usage of <foreign lang="greek">ἤδη</foreign> and analogous particles of time, in the way of illustration and exemplification. <foreign lang="greek">Ἤδη</foreign> and its analogues <foreign lang="greek">ἔτι, οὐκέτι, οὔπω</foreign>, are used emphatically to mark a critical point, climax, degree attained, as deserving of special and particular attention, at the moment, and in reference to something else which is not equally remarkable. They are all particles of time, and derive this their secondary sense from the metaphorical application of this notion of &lsquo;already&rsquo;, a definite time which we have just reached: &lsquo;point&rsquo;, or &lsquo;stage&rsquo;, or &lsquo;degree&rsquo; attained being substituted by the metaphor for &lsquo;time&rsquo; in the original sense of the word. </p>
						<p>This will be best illustrated by a few examples. Arist. <foreign lang="greek">περὶ μνήμης καὶ ἀναμνήσεως</foreign> c. 2. 16, <foreign lang="greek">ὥσπερ φύσις ἤδη τὸ ἔθος</foreign>, &lsquo;habit, already by this time, <hi rend="italic">now</hi> that we have reached this point, has become a second nature&rsquo;. Met. <foreign lang="greek">Δ</foreign> 21, 1022 <hi rend="italic">b</hi> 18, <foreign lang="greek">ἕνα δὲ [τρόπον πάθος λέγεται] τούτων ἐνέργειαι καὶ ἀλλοιώσεις ἤδη</foreign>, &lsquo;one sense of <foreign lang="greek">πάθος</foreign> is, the <hi rend="italic">actual</hi> energies and changes of these&rsquo;. <foreign lang="greek">ἤδη</foreign>, by the time that they have reached this stage or state, and have <hi rend="italic">actually</hi> become what they are. Categ. c. 8, 9, <hi rend="italic">a</hi> 4, <foreign lang="greek">ἣν ἄν τις ἴσως ἕξιν ἤδη προσαγορεύσοι</foreign>, &lsquo;which may <hi rend="italic">now</hi> (at this stage) be fairly called a <foreign lang="greek">ἕξις. περὶ ἑρμηνείας</foreign> c. 9, 19, <hi rend="italic">a</hi> 39, <foreign lang="greek">καὶ μᾶλλον μὲν ἀληθῆ τὴν ἑτέραν, οὐ μέντοι ἤδη</foreign> (not <hi rend="italic">yet</hi> actually, not <hi rend="italic">quite</hi>, not yet arrived at the stage of,) <foreign lang="greek">ἀληθῆ ἢ ψευδῆ</foreign>.

VIII (v) 8, 1308 <hi rend="italic">a</hi> 15, <foreign lang="greek">ἔστι γὰρ ὥσπερ δῆμος ἤδη οἱ ὅμοιοι</foreign>, i.e. though this may not be strictly true of all oligarchies, when we come to the <foreign lang="greek">ὅμοιοι</foreign>, at this stage, by this time, it is now <hi rend="italic">quite</hi> true that <hi rend="italic">they</hi> may be regarded as a <foreign lang="greek">δῆμος</foreign>. Eth. Nic. V 3, 1132 <hi rend="italic">a</hi> 2, <foreign lang="greek">πρὸς ἕτερον καὶ ἐν κοινωνίᾳ ἤδη ὁ ἄρχων</foreign>, &lsquo;when a man has come to be a ruler, he must <hi rend="italic">then</hi>...&rsquo; in the case of others this perhaps is not necessarily true, but the ruler <hi rend="italic">must, actually</hi>, live or act in relation to others and in society&rsquo;.

Ib. &sect; 26, <foreign lang="greek">ἔργον ἤδη γίγνεται</foreign>. II 6 &sect; 12, and 25 &sect; 14, bis. I have confined myself in these illustrations to examples from Aristotle; from the ordinary language, in which this usage is at least equally common, I will content myself with citing Herod. III 5, <foreign lang="greek">ἀπὸ ταύτης ἤδη Αἴγυπτος</foreign>: and Eur. Hippol. 1195 (Monk) <foreign lang="greek">πρὸς πόντον ἤδη κειμένον Σαρωνικόν</foreign>. </p>
						<p>It is found also in French, Italian and German&mdash;<hi rend="italic">d&eacute;j&agrave;, gia, schon. C'est</hi> <pb n="14"/> <hi rend="italic">d&eacute;j&agrave; quelque chose</hi>, &lsquo;and <hi rend="italic">that's</hi> something&rsquo;. <hi rend="italic">das ist schon etwas.</hi> The Italian <hi rend="italic">gia</hi>, when used as an expression of assent, may be similarly explained. </p>
						<p>The use of <hi rend="italic">demum</hi> is precisely similar, and common in most Latin writers. Sallust, Cat. XX <hi rend="italic">idem velle atque idem nolle ea demum</hi> (that and that alone) <hi rend="italic">firma amicitia est.</hi> Quint. II 5, 1, <hi rend="italic">artemque de qua loquimur bonis demum</hi> (to the good, and to them alone) <hi rend="italic">tribui volunt.</hi> VII Praef. init. <hi rend="italic">neque enim ea demum quae ad docendum pertinent exsecuti sumus.</hi> VII 2, 21, VIII Prooem. 3, IV 5, 7, XI 1 &sect; 44, 3 &sect; 68, et passim. Cic. Tusc. Disp. I 19, 43, <hi rend="italic">eaque ei demum naturalis est sedes</hi>, et seq., de Orat. II 30, 131, <hi rend="italic">hi loci ei demum oratori prodesse possunt.</hi> Rarer is the analogous use of <hi rend="italic">denique</hi> and <hi rend="italic">tandem:</hi> Cic. de Orat. II 30, 131, c. 34, 146, <hi rend="italic">tum denique scrutari locos</hi>, c. 75, 304, <hi rend="italic">quantum est in eo tandem mali!</hi> c. 77, 315, <hi rend="italic">hisce omnibus rebus consideratis, tum denique id</hi>... Hor. Ep. I 17, 2, <hi rend="italic">quo tandem pacto</hi>... On <hi rend="italic">iam</hi> in this same usage, see Munro, on Lucr. I 600, 613, II 314, 426; add, II 974, and Virg. Aen. V 179, <hi rend="italic">iam senior</hi>, VI 304, VII 46, 735. </p>
						<p>Similarly in a negative sentence, <foreign lang="greek">οὔπω</foreign> sometimes introduces the notion of time in estimating the amount or degree, Eth. Nic. V 10, 1135 <hi rend="italic">a</hi> 11, <foreign lang="greek">τὸ αὐτὸ δὲ τοῦτο, ὅταν πραχθῇ, ἀδίκημά ἐστι, πρὶν δὲ πραχθῆναι οὔπω, ἀλλ’  ἄδικον</foreign>. Ib. 23, <foreign lang="greek">ἄδικον μὲν ἀδίκημα δὲ οὔπω</foreign>. Ib. <hi rend="italic">b</hi> 24, <foreign lang="greek">οὐ μέντοι πω ἄδικοι</foreign> &mdash;in the two former cases the unjust habit of mind is distinguished as &lsquo;not yet <hi rend="italic">amounting</hi> to&rsquo; the actual crime or unjust <hi rend="italic">act;</hi> and in the third case this distinction is applied to the <foreign lang="greek">ἁμάρτημα</foreign>, which, though a wrong in itself, has not yet reached the stage or degree of the <hi rend="italic">vice</hi>, confirmed evil habit, of <foreign lang="greek">ἀδικία</foreign>&mdash;also VI 10, 1142 <hi rend="italic">b</hi> 14, <foreign lang="greek">αὕτη γὰρ οὔπω φάσις</foreign>. Ib. 25, <foreign lang="greek">οὐδ’  αὕτη πω εὐβουλία</foreign>, and 28. </p>
						<p>So also <foreign lang="greek">οὐκέτι</foreign>, &lsquo;no longer; not as before; not, now that we have reached this point&rsquo;. Pol. V (VIII) 3, 1338 <hi rend="italic">a</hi> 6. Rhet.

						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">συνήρηται</lemma>] (Bekker and Spengel. Alii <foreign lang="greek">συνήρτηται</foreign>) &lsquo;with whom are connected...&rsquo; In <foreign lang="greek">πρὸς οὕς, πρὸς</foreign> expresses a mere general reference, &lsquo;with respect to whom&rsquo;, &lsquo;in whose case&rsquo;; and <foreign lang="greek">συνῄρηται</foreign> &lsquo;are often taken into, embraced in, the account&rsquo;, <foreign lang="greek">σύν</foreign>, together with their proper business, the mere facts of the case and the proof of them. I can find no sufficient authority for <foreign lang="greek">συναιρεῖν</foreign> in this sense; the nearest approach to it is in Plat. Phaedr. 249 B, <foreign lang="greek">εἰς ἓν λογισμῷ συναιρούμενον</foreign>, but even this is something different. Vater makes a similar observation. The interpretation also of <foreign lang="greek">πρός</foreign> is certainly rather strained. Probably <foreign lang="greek">συνήρτηται</foreign> is right. <pb n="15"/> </p>
						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">τὸ ἀληθές</lemma>] No one is a fair judge, where his own passions or interests are concerned. Gaisford quotes appositely, Pol. III 16, 1287 <hi rend="italic">a</hi> ult. <foreign lang="greek">ἀλλὰ μὴν εἰσάγονταί γ’  ἐφ̓ ἑαυτοὺς οἱ ἰατροὶ κάμνοντες ἄλλους ἰατρούς, καὶ οἱ παιδοτρίβαι γυμναζόμενοι παιδοτρίβας, ὡς οὐ δυνάμενοι κρίνειν τὸ ἀληθὲς διὰ τὸ κρίνειν περὶ τῶν οἰκείων καὶ ἐν πάθει ὄντες</foreign>. </p>
						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ἐπισκοτεῖν</lemma>] &lsquo;to bring darkness, throw a shadow over, overshadow&rsquo;. Dem. c. Mid. 565, 25, <foreign lang="greek">οἰκίαν ᾠκοδόμηκεν ἐν Ἐλευσῖνι τοσαύτην ὥστε πᾶσιν ἐπισκοτεῖν τοῖς ἐν τῷ τόπῳ</foreign>. Infr. III 3, 3. Plat. Euthyd. 274, <foreign lang="greek">ὁ Εὐθύδημος ἐπεσκότει τῷ Κτησίππῳ τῆς θέας</foreign>: an odd and unexplained use of this word. It seems to mean that Euthydemus, by bending forward and getting in the way, obscured or darkened Ctesippus&mdash;not however in the ordinary sense of the word, but in that of intercepting the object, and <hi rend="italic">so</hi> darkening by throwing a cloud over, and thereby depriving him of his view (<foreign lang="greek">τῆς θέας</foreign> gen. of deprivation, implied in the verb). </p>
						<p>In a metaphorical sense it occurs in Dem. Olynth. B 23, 26, Isocr. ad Dem. &sect; 6, and in several fragments of the Comic Poets, (Ind. ad Meineke, <hi rend="italic">Fr. Com.

The difference usually taken between <foreign lang="greek">συνθήκη</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">συνάλλαγμα</foreign> appears in Rhet.

						<p>The ordinary signification of both of these is a contract, or covenant, or mutual agreement, or interchange (<foreign lang="greek">συνάλλαγμα</foreign>), between two or more parties. They are thence extended to any dealings, especially business transactions, or even any circumstances of ordinary intercourse between man and man, and more particularly any of those which may give rise to a suit at law. These are <foreign lang="greek">ἴδια συμβόλαια</foreign> or <foreign lang="greek">συναλλάγματα</foreign>: see Dem. de Cor. p. 298 &sect; 210, <foreign lang="greek">τὰ τοῦ καθ’  ἡμέραν βίου συμβόλαια</foreign>, with Dissen's note: Isocr.

						<p>That the meaning of the terms is not confined to contracts proper, is plain also from Eth. N. v 1131 <hi rend="italic">a</hi> 2.

						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">δῆλον δέ] δέ</lemma>, omitted by one MS, and rejected by Buhle, Schrader, Bekker, and Spengel, is retained and defended by Victorius and Vater. It is justified not only by the common usage of the Greek language (see Buttm. Exc. XII on Dem. c. Mid. <hi rend="italic">de particula</hi> <foreign lang="greek">δέ</foreign> <hi rend="italic">in apodosi</hi>, p. 150; the passages which he thus quotes might be multiplied indefinitely), but also by the special usage of Aristotle himself. Waitz, on Organ. 17 <hi rend="italic">b</hi> 1, Vol. I p. 335, comp. Zell ad Eth. Nic. I 1 &sect; 4, Vol. II p. 5, who quotes examples from Aristotle, to which add Rhet.

Phys. VI 8, 2, <foreign lang="greek">εἰ τὸ μέν... ἵστασθαι δέ</foreign>. See also Stallb. on Ph&aelig;do 78 C. The particle is thus used in the apodosis generally, not always, as a repetition of a preceding <foreign lang="greek">δέ</foreign>, and in these cases may be translated by &ldquo;I say&rdquo;. It <hi rend="italic">repeats</hi> in order to recal the attention to the connexion of the apodosis with the foregoing protasis, which might be overlooked after a long parenthesis: in cases where this would not be necessary, it may be accounted for by the influence of habit or association. Of the many illustrative passages I had collected from other writers as well as Aristotle, I will content myself with citing two or three apposite ones from Thucydides.

It is to the effect, that truth and right having a natural superiority over falsehood and wrong, the proper use of Rhetoric is to enable them to assert and enforce that superiority; to bring truth to light, and detect and expose deceit and sophistry. If the opposites of truth and right <hi rend="italic">do</hi> ever prevail over these, it must be the fault of the parties concerned themselves, <foreign lang="greek">ἀνάγκη δἰ αὐτῶν ἡττᾶσθαι</foreign>, who have failed to avail themselves <pb n="23"/> of this powerful instrument.

						<p>According to this translation of <foreign lang="greek">δἰ αὐτῶν</foreign>, it is correctly and logically said that it is <hi rend="italic">a consequence</hi> (<foreign lang="greek">ὥστε</foreign>) of the natural superiority of truth and right to their opposites, that if those who have truth and right on their side are defeated, their defeat must be due to themselves, to their own neglect of Rhetoric, which would have enabled them to <hi rend="italic">enforce</hi> this their <hi rend="italic">natural</hi> superiority.

The ordinary <foreign lang="greek">συμβεβηκότα</foreign> are <hi rend="italic">separable</hi> accidents, qualities or properties, which do <hi rend="italic">not</hi> form part of this essence of the subject, or consequently of its definition; with or without which the essence of the subject, (that which constitutes its being, or makes it to be what it is,) remains the same. The <foreign lang="greek">συμβεβηκότα καθ’  αὑτά</foreign> are distinguished from the ordinary <foreign lang="greek">συμβεβηκότα</foreign> in this; that although they are not of the essence, and therefore do not enter into the definition, still they are immediately deducible from it, and <hi rend="italic">inseparable</hi> from the subject, and are therefore the proper objects of study. They are in fact identifiable with the <foreign lang="greek">ἴδια</foreign> or <hi rend="italic">propria</hi> of the five predicables. The <foreign lang="greek">συμβεβηκότα πάθη τοῖς μεγέθεσι</foreign> in the text are accordingly &lsquo;the inseparable properties of magnitudes&rsquo;; as &lsquo;the equality of the interior angles of a triangle to two right angles&rsquo; is a necessary property of the triangle, though not included in the definition, which is &lsquo;a plane figure bounded by three straight lines&rsquo;: still the property is deducible from the definition, and thus is inseparable from the notion of it: the triangle cannot exist without this property, though it is not of its essence, and therefore not part of the definition.

I 19, 87, where only the <foreign lang="greek">ἦθος</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">πάθος</foreign> are directly mentioned, but the other, which is absolutely indispensable, must of course be assumed as a third division: by Cicero himself, de Orat. II 27, 115, <hi rend="italic">ita omnis ratio dicendi tribus ad persuadendum rebus est nixa; ut probemus vera esse quae defendimus; ut conciliemus nobis eos qui audiunt; ut animos eorum ad quemcunque causa postulabit motum vocemus.</hi> This is repeated in &sect;&sect; 121 and 128 and the <foreign lang="greek">ἦθος</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">πάθος</foreign> described at length in c. 43 and the following. These two latter are again referred to Orat. XXXVII 128; and again in Partitiones Oratoriae XIII 46 the three <foreign lang="greek">πίστεις</foreign> are thus ingeniously distinguished in a twofold division. <hi rend="italic">Argumentandi duo</hi> <pb n="29"/> <hi rend="italic">sunt genera, quorum alterum ad fidem directe spectat, alterum se inflectit ad motum.</hi> (These are the &lsquo;direct&rsquo; and &lsquo;indirect&rsquo; proofs and arguments.) <hi rend="italic">Dirigitur cum proposuit aliquid quod probaret, sumpsitque ea quibus niteretur; atque his confirmatis ad propositum se retulit atque conclusit. Illa autem altera argumentatio, quasi retro et contra, prius sumit quae vult eaque confirmat, deinde id quod proponendum fuit permotis animis iacit ad extremum.</hi> </p>
						<p>Quintilian touches on this subject in many places of his work; the most detailed account of <foreign lang="greek">ἦθος</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">πάθος</foreign> is given in the second chapter of his sixth book: the description and distinction of them occur in &sect;&sect; 18, 19. They are both referred, as subordinate species, to the general head of &lsquo;<hi rend="italic">affectus</hi>&rsquo;, &sect; 8, comp. &sect; 12; and these are again distinguished from the direct and logical arguments, &sect; 3. In this and the following section he compares these two classes of arguments together in respect of their rhetorical value and importance, and comes to a conclusion precisely opposite to that of Aristotle. For Aristotle holds that these indirect proofs, though necessary to the orator by reason of the deficiencies and infirmities of his audience, <foreign lang="greek">διὰ τὴν τοῦ ἀκροατοῦ μοχθηρίαν</foreign>, III 1 &sect; 5, and therefore not to be excluded from the theory or practice of Rhetoric, yet are to be regarded as merely auxiliary and subordinate, standing in the same relation to the direct proofs as dress and personal ornaments to the body, serviceable but not essential. Quintilian on the contrary pronounces that these in comparison with the overpowering force of the appeals to the feelings are only not contemptible in respect of their power of persuasion; <hi rend="italic">quos equidem non contemno, sed hactenus utiles credo ne quid per eos iudici sit ignotum; atque ut dicam quod sentio, dignos a quibus causas diserti docerentur</hi> &sect; 3: that those that use them therefore are only fit to lay before the judges the facts of the case, not to influence their decision, and to instruct the real advocate, who can sway their minds and feelings at his will, and force them to decide in favour of his client: <hi rend="italic">ubi vero animis iudicum vis afferenda est, et ab ipsa veri contemplatione abducenda mens, ibi proprium oratoris opus est</hi> &sect; 5. </p>
						<p>It may be observed in concluding this note, that there is a somewhat important difference, which I have already pointed out in the Introduction, between Aristotle's view of the use to be made of <foreign lang="greek">ἦθος</foreign> in the practice of Rhetoric, and that of the Latin Rhetoricians, as well as the author of the Rhet. ad Alex.; see c. 39 (38) 2. Quintilian's <hi rend="italic">auctoritas</hi>&mdash;and compare Cicero in de Oratore, II 43&mdash;expresses the influence of character upon opinion, in general: but in Aristotle's system the <foreign lang="greek">ἦθος</foreign> means something more; the effect must be produced immediately <hi rend="italic">by the speech</hi> <foreign lang="greek">δεῖ δὲ καὶ τουτο συμβαίνειν διὰ τὸν λόγον, ἀλλὰ μὴ διὰ τὸ προδεδόξασθαι ποῖόν τινα εἶναι τὸν λέγοντα</foreign>, Rhet. I 2, 4; and hence it finds a place in Rhetoric <hi rend="italic">as in Art:</hi> whereas in the other view the <hi rend="italic">auctoritas</hi> exercised may have been previously acquired, and altogether <foreign lang="greek">ἔξω τοῦ πράγματος</foreign>, acting independ<pb n="30"/> ently of any artistic or systematic process, in the way of reasoning or proving. </p>

						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ἁπλῶς</lemma>] has various usages. It may for instance mean (I) &lsquo;simply&rsquo;, opposed to <foreign lang="greek">συνθέσει</foreign> or <foreign lang="greek">κατὰ συμπλοκήν</foreign>: and this appears to be the primary sense of the word, in accordance with the derivation. Thus as the elements of nature are often called <foreign lang="greek">ἁπλᾶ σώματα</foreign> in their simple, uncombined state, so we have <foreign lang="greek">ἁπλῶς</foreign>, de Anima II 14, 8, to denote &lsquo;singly, or simply, by itself&rsquo; (<foreign lang="greek">καθ’  ἑαυτήν</foreign> Themistius), without the admixture of any other element; <foreign lang="greek">δοκεῖ δέ τισιν ἡ τοῦ πυρὸς φύσις ἁπλῶς αἰτία τῆς τροφῆς καὶ τῆς αὐξήσεως εἶναι</foreign>. Similarly when applied in a moral sense to human character, it denotes &lsquo;simplicity&rsquo; (of composition), &lsquo;singleness&rsquo; of heart and purpose, as opposed to &lsquo;duplicity&rsquo;, (Plat. Rep. III 397 E, <foreign lang="greek">οὐ διπλοῦς ἀνὴρ οὐδὲ πολλαπλοῦς</foreign>. VIII 55, 4 D, Rhet. I 9, 29, Eur. Rhes. 395 <foreign lang="greek">φιλῶ λέγειν τἀληθὲς ἀεὶ κοὐ διπλοῦς πέφυκ’  ἀνήρ</foreign>. Ruhnk. Tim. p. 86). </p>
						<p>The commonest signification however is that of (2) <hi rend="italic">simpliciter et sine exceptione</hi> &lsquo;generally&rsquo; or &lsquo;universally&rsquo;, as opposed to <foreign lang="greek">καθ’  ἕκαστον</foreign>, &lsquo;specially&rsquo;, &lsquo;particularly&rsquo;, &lsquo;individually&rsquo;, Eth. N. I 1, 1095 <hi rend="italic">a</hi> 1, or to <foreign lang="greek">ἔστιν ὡς</foreign> &lsquo;partially&rsquo;, or <foreign lang="greek">κατὰ μέρος</foreign>, de Anima II 5, 4, <foreign lang="greek">νῦν γὰρ ἁπλῶς ἐλέγομεν περὶ αὐτῶν</foreign>, in <hi rend="italic">general</hi> terms&mdash;we must now come to <hi rend="italic">particulars.</hi> Hence it signifies &lsquo;altogether&rsquo;, &lsquo;absolutely&rsquo;, <hi rend="italic">omnino</hi>, as <foreign lang="greek">οὐδὲν ἁπλῶς</foreign> &lsquo;none at all&rsquo;, de Part. An. IV 13, 9, <foreign lang="greek">ἀδύνατον ὅλως</foreign> &lsquo;absolutely impossible&rsquo;. Plato will supply abundance of examples of this usage. See also Waitz, <hi rend="italic">Comm. on Organ.</hi> Vol. I p. 354, who exemplifies it from Aristotle. </p>
						<p>From this again may be distinguished a third sense (3), in which it is equivalent to <foreign lang="greek">καθ’  αὑτόν</foreign>, and opposed to <foreign lang="greek">πρός τι</foreign>, &lsquo;the relative&rsquo;. In this sense it is defined, Top. B 11, 115 <hi rend="italic">b</hi> 33, <foreign lang="greek">ὃ ἂν μηδενὸς προστιθεμένου δοκῇ εἶναι καλὸν ἢ αἰσχρὸν ἢ ἄλλο τι τῶν τοιούτων, ἁπλῶς ῥηθήσεται</foreign>. de Soph. El. c. 5, 166 <hi rend="italic">b</hi> 22 and <hi rend="italic">b</hi> 37, where <foreign lang="greek">τὸ ἁπλῶς</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">μὴ ἁπλῶς</foreign> are opposed as the absolute and relative in a paralogism of the substitution of the one for the other. Anal. Post. I 4, 83 <hi rend="italic">a</hi> 15, <foreign lang="greek">κατηγορεῖν μὲν μὴ ἁπλῶς κατὰ συμβεβηκὸς δὲ κατηγορεῖν</foreign>. Eth. N. I 3, 1095 <hi rend="italic">b</hi> 3, Polit. IV (VII) 1, 1323 <hi rend="italic">b</hi> 17, <foreign lang="greek">καὶ ἁπλῶς</foreign> (absolutely, in itself) <foreign lang="greek">καὶ ἡμῖν</foreign> (relatively to us). <pb n="31"/> </p>
						<p>From these three may perhaps be distinguished a fourth sense (4) in which it occurs; for instance, in Met. A 6, 987 <hi rend="italic">a</hi> 21, <foreign lang="greek">οἱ Πυθαγόρειοι... λίαν ἁπλῶς ἐπραγματευθησαν</foreign> &ldquo;treated the subject too simply&rdquo;, i. e. too carelessly, without taking sufficient pains with it, with insufficient <hi rend="italic">elaboration;</hi> &lsquo;<hi rend="italic">negligenter</hi>&rsquo;, Bonitz ad loc. q. v. On the various modes in which <foreign lang="greek">ἁπλῶς</foreign> is opposed to the relative and particular see Schrader on I 9, 17. </p>
						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">κυριωτάτην ἔχει πίστιν τὸ ἦθος</lemma>] &lsquo;is the most authoritative, effective, instrument of persuasion&rsquo;. On the influence of character on the judgment add to the passages already quoted, Rhet. ad Alex. c. 38 (39), 2, and Isocr. <foreign lang="greek">ἀντίδοσις</foreign> &sect;&sect; 276&mdash;280. </p>
						<p>The oratorical artifice here described is well illustrated by Marc Antony's speech in <hi rend="italic">Fulius Caesar</hi>, Act III Sc. 2, &ldquo;I come not, friends, to steal away your hearts,&rdquo; &amp;c. </p>
						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">κύριος</lemma> in this and similar cases seems to derive its meaning from the &lsquo;authority&rsquo; or &lsquo;influence&rsquo; exercised by any one or any thing that has the power of doing so, of which general notion it is a special application. It corresponds to our &lsquo;sovereign&rsquo;, as when we speak of a sovereign remedy. Trendelenburg, on de Anima II 5, 7, <hi rend="italic">Comm.</hi> p. 368, would connect this signification with the <foreign lang="greek">κύριος νόμος</foreign>, &lsquo;ratio e iudiciis et foro tracta videtur. <foreign lang="greek">κύριος νόμος</foreign>, qui <foreign lang="greek">ἀκύρῳ</foreign> oppositus est, lex est quae rata viget &amp;c.&mdash;ita hic <foreign lang="greek">κύρια ὀνόματα</foreign>, quatenus eorum auctoritas valet.&rsquo; This is perhaps unnecessarily narrowing the signification. Other persons and things, besides laws, exercise authority. A good instance of <foreign lang="greek">κύριος</foreign> in this general sense, implying superiority, authority, mastery, occurs in de Anima II 8, 3, 419 <hi rend="italic">b</hi> 19, <foreign lang="greek">οὐκ ἔστι δὲ ψόφου κύριος ὁ ἀὴρ οὐδὲ τὸ ὕδωρ</foreign>, where <foreign lang="greek">κύριος</foreign> may be interpreted &lsquo;absolute master&rsquo;, the air and water are not <hi rend="italic">absolute masters</hi> of sound: some other conditions are required to produce it. Ib. 419 <hi rend="italic">b</hi> 33, <foreign lang="greek">τὸ δὲ κενὸν ὀρθῶς λέγεται κύριον τοῦ ἀκούειν</foreign>. </p>

						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">διὰ δὲ τῶν λόγων</lemma>] In &sect; 3 we are told that there are three kinds of <foreign lang="greek">πίστεις</foreign> or rhetorical proofs, which are conveyed through the channel or <hi rend="italic">medium</hi>-(<foreign lang="greek">διά</foreign> with the <hi rend="italic">genitive</hi>) of the speech. These three are then described <hi rend="italic">seriatim.</hi> The first, &sect; 4, is <foreign lang="greek">διὰ τοῦ ἤθους</foreign>; the second (&sect; 5), <foreign lang="greek">διὰ τῶν ἀκροατῶν, ὅταν εἰς πάθος ὑπὸ τοῦ λόγου προαχθῶσιν</foreign>; and the third, &sect; 6, <foreign lang="greek">διὰ τῶν λόγων</foreign>, plainly in the sense of the direct <foreign lang="greek">πίστεις</foreign> or arguments proper, <foreign lang="greek">ὅταν ἀληθὲς ἢ φαινόμενον δείξωμεν ἐκ τῶν περὶ ἕκαστα πιθανῶν. διὰ τῶν λόγων</foreign> is the reading of all the MSS except A^{c}, which has <foreign lang="greek">τὸν λόγον</foreign>: but this, as an unnecessary and unaccountable departure from the construction of the parallel expressions, <foreign lang="greek">διὰ τοῦ λόγου, τοῦ ἤθους, τῶν ἀκροατῶν</foreign>, and afterwards <foreign lang="greek">διὰ τούτων</foreign>, seems to be self-condemned. </p>
						<p>By these <foreign lang="greek">λόγοι</foreign> we may understand either the actual words which are the instruments or <hi rend="italic">medium</hi> of the reasonings, or better the reasonings or arguments themselves which the words convey. This explanation appears to be sufficiently rational and consistent, and in accordance with the ordinary usages of the language. Spengel, however, in his paper <hi rend="italic">&uuml;ber die Rhet. des Arist.</hi> (Trans. Bav. Acad. 1851) p. 26, and again in his edition of the Rhetoric, Vol. II p. 46, thinks that the text requires alteration, and would read <foreign lang="greek">δἰ αὐτοῦ δὲ τοῦ λόγου</foreign>, or <foreign lang="greek">διὰ δ’  αὐτοῦ τοῦ λόγου</foreign>, which seems to be totally unnecessary. The explanation above given is confirmed by the rendering of the <hi rend="italic">Vetus Translatio</hi> &lsquo;per orationes autem credimus&rsquo;, where &lsquo;<hi rend="italic">orationes</hi>&rsquo; plainly stands for the &lsquo;words of the speeches in which these arguments are expressed&rsquo;. </p>
						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ἀληθὲς ἢ φαινόμενον</lemma>] The second of these terms denotes the fallacious branch of Rhetoric, &lsquo;the apparent, unreal, sham&rsquo; arguments, exemplified in II 24, and corresponding to the spurious branch of Dialectics treated in the <foreign lang="greek">Σοφιστικοὶ ἔλεγχοι</foreign>, and appended to the Topics. The illustration of these is allowed to enter into a scientific treatise only for the purpose of detecting and exposing these fallacies, and enabling the pleader or dialectician to confute them when employed by an adversary. <foreign lang="greek">ἔστι γὰρ ἡ σοφιστικὴ φαινομένη σοφία οὖσα δ’  οὔ</foreign>, de Soph. El. I, 165 <hi rend="italic">a</hi> 21. </p>

						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ἐπεὶ δὲ αἱ πίστεισκαὶ πῶς</lemma>] &ldquo;seeing then that these are the channels, or modes of communication of rhetorical proofs, it is plain that to grasp, or get possession, or make himself master of them (<foreign lang="greek">λαβεῖν</foreign>) is a task for one who has a capacity for logical reasoning, and for the contemplation or study of characters, and thirdly [for the discernment] of the emotions;&mdash;and of the latter, what each is in itself, and what are its qualities and properties (<foreign lang="greek">ποῖόν τι</foreign>), and from what sources (what motives and impulses, <foreign lang="greek">ἐκ τίνων</foreign>,) it may be excited, and in what modes (<foreign lang="greek">πῶς</foreign>).&rdquo;&mdash; <foreign lang="greek">ταῦτα...ἐστὶ λαβεῖν τοῦ συλλογίσασθαι δυναμένου</foreign>, lit. &lsquo;<hi rend="italic">it belongs to the</hi> student of logic <hi rend="italic">to get hold of them</hi>&rsquo;. </p>
						<p>Of these the logical branch belongs to Dialectics, which teaches the habit of reasoning and discussion, the other two to the study of Ethics, <pb n="33"/> which deals with human beings as individuals, and investigates the fixed habits, virtuous or vicious (<foreign lang="greek">ἕξεις</foreign>), which constitute their characters (<foreign lang="greek">ἤθη</foreign>), and the moral <foreign lang="greek">πάθη</foreign> or &lsquo;emotions&rsquo;, which when developed by exercise, according to the direction which they take, become virtues and vices. The consequence is, <foreign lang="greek">ὥστε συμβαίνει</foreign>, that Rhetoric may be considered a scion or offshoot of the study of Dialectics and Ethics, the latter &lsquo;which may fairly be called Politics&rsquo; (because it treats of men in society and therefore includes the science of the individual, <foreign lang="greek">ἡ μὲν οὖν μέθοδος</foreign> (Ethics) <foreign lang="greek">τούτων ἐφίεται, πολιτική τις οὖσα</foreign>. Eth. Nic. I 1, 1074 <hi rend="italic">b</hi> 11), standing to them in the relation of the offshoot to the parent plant. <hi rend="italic">Sed idem</hi> (Aristoteles) <hi rend="italic">et de arte rhetorica tres libros scripsit, et in eorum primo non artem solum eam fatetur, sed ei particulam civilitatis sicut dialectices assignat.</hi> Quint. Inst. Orat. II 17, 4. </p>
						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">συλλογίσασθαι</lemma>] improperly applied here, as <foreign lang="greek">ἀπόδειξις</foreign> above, I &sect; 11 p. 19, to <hi rend="italic">rhetorical</hi> reasoning. But as there the rhetorical <foreign lang="greek">πίστεις</foreign> are called a kind of demonstration, &lsquo;a sort of&rsquo;, or subordinate variety of, demonstration in a general sense, so here the syllogistic process is allowed to stand for reasoning in general, to which even rhetorical reasoning, though not syllogistic in the strict sense, but enthymematic, of course belongs. </p>
						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">παραφυές</lemma>] which usually appears under the form <foreign lang="greek">παραφυάς</foreign> in Aristotle and Theophrastus, properly denotes either a branch or a separate plant &lsquo;growing alongside&rsquo; of the parent plant, and proceeding either from the stem or the root, as a scion or offshoot. In the latter of these two senses it certainly occurs in Theophr. Hist. Plant. II 2, 4, <foreign lang="greek">ἐὰν ἀπὸ ῥίζης ἡ παραφυὰς ἦ</foreign>, though here also the hypothetical <foreign lang="greek">ἐάν</foreign> admits the other possibility. Also <foreign lang="greek">παραφύεσθαι</foreign>, Hist. Plant. III 17, 3, <foreign lang="greek">ἀποκοπὲν δὲ καὶ ἐπικαυθὲν παραφύεται</foreign> (grows from the root) <foreign lang="greek">καὶ ἀναβλαστάνει</foreign>. This word and its cognates, <foreign lang="greek">παραφύεσθαι, παράφυσις, ἀποφυάς</foreign> (Hist. An. II 1, 53, de part. An. III 5 &sect; 1, 10 &sect; 5, 14 &sect; 14, Theophr. Hist. Plant. I 6, 6, VII 2, 5 and 8, &amp;c.), <foreign lang="greek">παραβλαστάνειν, -βλαστή, -βλάστημα</foreign>, are applied by Aristotle and his pupil Theophrastus primarily to plants, and by analogy to the corresponding parts of animals. </p>
						<p>It occurs again as a metaphor in Eth. Nic. I 4, 1096 <hi rend="italic">a</hi> 21, <foreign lang="greek">παραφυάδι γὰρ τοῦτ’  ἔοικε καὶ συμβεβηκότι τοῦ ὄντος</foreign>; that is, <foreign lang="greek">τὸ καθ’  αὑτό</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">ἡ οὐσία</foreign> stand to &lsquo;the relative&rsquo;, <foreign lang="greek">τὸ πρός τι</foreign>, in the same relation as parent plant to offshoot. &lsquo;Similitudo, explicante Giphanio, a pullis arborum desumta, qui Graecis dicuntur <foreign lang="greek">παραφυάδες</foreign>&rsquo;. Zell, ad loc. So that Rhetoric is represented by this metaphor as a scion derived from two stocks or plants, Dialectics and Ethics, not identical with either, but with a general or inherited family resemblance to both. (The analogy will not bear <pb n="34"/> pressing: one does not see, for example, how a young plant can be the scion or offspring of <hi rend="italic">two</hi> others, but this general meaning is clear, that it bears a likeness to both, though differing from each of them.) </p>
						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ὑποδύεται ὑπὸ τὸ σχῆμα</lemma>] &lsquo;creeps under, insinuates itself into, the form or figure&rsquo;; &lsquo;assumes the mask or disguise of (for the purpose of acting a part)&rsquo;, &lsquo;personates&rsquo;, Plat. Gorg. 464 C, <foreign lang="greek">ἡ κολακευτική...ὑποδῦσα ὑπὸ ἕκαστον τῶν μορίων προσποιεῖται εἶναι τοῦτο ὅπερ ὑπέδυ...ὑπὸ μὲν οὖν τὴν ἰατρικὴν ἡ ὀψοποιικὴ ὑποδέδυκε</foreign>... Sopater, ap.

						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ἀλαζονεία</lemma> implies both presumption and imposture; either a character between both and a mixture of <hi rend="italic">both</hi> (as Theophrastus' <foreign lang="greek">ἀλαζών</foreign>, &lsquo;the braggart&rsquo;, of which Pyrgopolinices in the <hi rend="italic">Miles Gloriosus</hi>, Thraso in the <hi rend="italic">Eunuchus</hi>, and Captain Bobadil in <hi rend="italic">Every Man in his Humour</hi>, are the three types, ancient and modern; and probably also the Sophistical Rhetoricians here referred to): or again a character in which <hi rend="italic">either</hi> presumption <hi rend="italic">or</hi> imposture is characteristic and predominant. For example, the insolent assumption, arrogance, and swagger appear more prominently in this picture of the <foreign lang="greek">ἀλαζών</foreign> drawn by Xenophon, Cyrop. II 2, 12, <foreign lang="greek">ὁ μὲν γὰρ ἀλαζὼν ἔμοιγε δοκεῖ ὄνομα κεῖσθαι ἐπὶ τοῖς προσποιουμένοις καὶ πλουσιωτέροις εἶναι ἤ εἰσι, καὶ ἀνδρειοτέροις, καὶ ποιήσειν ἃ μὴ ἱκανοί εἰσιν ὑπισχνουμένοις· καὶ ταῦτα φανεροῖς γιγνομένοις ὅτι τοῦ λαβεῖν τι ἕνεκα καὶ κερδᾶναι· ποιοῦσιν</foreign>. This last mercenary element is not found elsewhere in the character of the <foreign lang="greek">ἀλαζών</foreign>. In Aristotle, Eth. Nic. II 7, IV 13, empty pretension, ostentation and swagger are the leading characteristics of the <foreign lang="greek">ἀλαζών</foreign>. The vice is one of the extremes of which <foreign lang="greek">ἀλήθεια</foreign>, the social virtue of frankness, sincerity, and plain dealing is the mean, the opposite extreme being <foreign lang="greek">εἰρωνεία</foreign>, &lsquo;mock&rsquo; in conversation, Socrates' habit. It is the extreme in <foreign lang="greek">προσποίησις</foreign>, &lsquo;pretension&rsquo;, of which <foreign lang="greek">ἀλήθεια</foreign> is the mean state. Whereas in Aristophanes it usually represents rather the other side of the character, its quackery and imposture; and <foreign lang="greek">ἀλαζών</foreign> is &lsquo;a quack or a humbug&rsquo;. Of course Socrates and his brother Sophists are the great representatives of the class. <hi rend="italic">Nubes</hi> 102, 1494, <hi rend="italic">et passim.</hi> And this is also the side of the character which is generally uppermost in Plato's view of it. See Rep. VI 486 B, 490 A, VIII 560 C, Phaedo 92 D, <foreign lang="greek">ἡδονὴ...ἁπάντων ἀλαζονέστατον</foreign>, Phil. 65 C. The definition of it given in the Platonic <foreign lang="greek">ὅροι</foreign>, p. 416, is that of undue pretension, assumption, imposture. <foreign lang="greek">ἕξις προσποιητικὴ ἀγαθοῦ ἢ ἀγαθῶν τῶν μὴ ὑπαρχόντων</foreign>. Quackery and imposture are also predominant in the application of it, Rhet. II 6, 11. </p>
						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">δἰ ἄλλας αἰτίας ἀνθρωπικάς</lemma>] &lsquo;incident to humanity&rsquo;, implying the infirmities, imperfections, frailties, miseries, and especially errors to which <pb n="35"/> the human condition is exposed, and from which the divine nature, which is tactily opposed to it in this conception, is exempt. &lsquo;The other human causes&rsquo; here referred to are any other defects or imperfections to which the human nature is liable.

						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ἢ ὁντινοῦν</lemma>] is rejected by Spengel on the authority of Dionysius, who omits it, and against that of the Aristotelian MSS, which, as appears from Bekker's revision, all agree in retaining it. It is not merely perfectly intelligible, and absolutely unexceptionable on all critical grounds, but when compared with the commencement of the Anal. Post., to which reference is immediately after made, it seems to tally so precisely with what is there stated, that it might almost be regarded as a necessary addition. In the passage of the Analytics we are told that every kind of instruction and learning, proof scientific and popular, mathematical or dialectical knowledge, is conveyed by way of syllogism or induction: and it is then added, <foreign lang="greek">ὡς δ’  αὕτως καὶ οἱ ῥητορικοὶ συμπείθουσιν· ἢ γὰρ διὰ παραδειγμάτων, ὅ ἐστιν ἐπαγωγή, ἢ δἰ ἐνθυμημάτων, ὅπερ ἐστὶ συλλογισμός</foreign>, a statement with which the <foreign lang="greek">ἢ ὁντινοῦν</foreign> of the Rhetoric seems to correspond to a nicety. And for the same reason I hold that this passage is referred to in <foreign lang="greek">ἐκ τῶν ἀναλυτικῶν</foreign>, as well as Anal. Pr. II 23, 68 <hi rend="italic">b</hi> 9, (quoted in the preceding note,) and the continuation of the subject there suggested in chapters 24 and 27, (which contain the logical description of induction and example, and the enthymeme), though Brandis, in his tract on the Rhetoric in Schneidewin's <hi rend="italic">Philologus</hi> IV 1, p. 24, would confine the reference to the latter passage. <pb n="37"/> </p>

						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">φανερὸν δ’  ὅτι ἑκάτερον ἔχει ἀγαθὸν τὸ εἶδος τῆς ῥητορικῆς</lemma>] &lsquo;It is plain that either kind of Rhetoric (the <foreign lang="greek">παραδειγματῶδες</foreign> or the <foreign lang="greek">ἐνθυμηματικὸν</foreign>) has good in it&rsquo;, that each of them has its own particular virtue and excellence, or advantage.

The work is mentioned twice by Dionysius, Ep. ad Amm. I cc. 6 and 8, each time in company with Analytics and Topics. From this circumstance and from the reference here, it is natural to conclude that its subject was connected in some way with Logic. Diogenes Laert. V 1, 23, includes in his list of Aristotle's writings <foreign lang="greek">μεθοδικά</foreign> in eight books, and &sect; 25, <foreign lang="greek">μεθοδικόν</foreign> in one: the former comes amongst the logical, the latter amongst the rhetorical works. It appears also in the list of the &lsquo;Anonymous&rsquo; author of the life of Aristotle (in Buhle, Vol. I p. 62), again in near connexion with works on Logic, <foreign lang="greek">Ἀναλυτικῶν, Προβλημάτων, Μεθοδικά</foreign>. Hesychius Milesius in his life of Aristotle (Buhle, Vol. I p. 72), describes it thus; <foreign lang="greek">πρὸς μὲν οὖν τὴν εὕρεσιν, τά τε τοπικὰ καὶ μεθοδικά, παρέδωκε</foreign> <pb n="38"/> <foreign lang="greek">προτάσεων πλῆθος, ἐξ ὧν πρὸς τὰ προβλήματα πιθανῶν ἐπιχειρημάτων οἷόντε εὐπορεῖν</foreign>: classing it, like Dionysius and Diogenes, with the Topics and Analytics, the latter of which is mentioned immediately after. Simplicius ad Categ. fol. 7 <hi rend="italic">a</hi> (quoted by Buhle) speaks of it as one of Aristotle's <foreign lang="greek">ὑπομνήματα</foreign>, <hi rend="italic">commentarii;</hi> <foreign lang="greek">ἐν τοῖς ὑπομνήμασιν, καὶ γὰρ ἐν τοῖς μεθοδικοῖς, καὶ ἐν τοῖς ὑπομνήμασι, καὶ ἐν ταῖς διαιρέσεσι, καὶ ἐν ἄλλῳ ὑπομνήματι</foreign>.

						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ῥητορεῖαι</lemma>] &lsquo;rhetorical exhibitions or displays&rsquo; Probl. XVIII 3. The word is a rare one, and as distinguished from <foreign lang="greek">ῥητορική</foreign> denotes rather the practice and results of Rhetoric, speaking and speeches, than the system and theory of it as embodied in the &lsquo;art&rsquo;. It is found in Plato, Polit. 304 A, where Stallbaum notes, &lsquo;vox <foreign lang="greek">ῥητορεία</foreign> a Platone ficta videtur ut ars oratoria nobilior et generosior distingueretur a varia illa <foreign lang="greek">ῥητορικῇ</foreign> cuius nomen profanaverant qui ad explendas suas cupiditates abusi erant.&rsquo; The fact, that the word was a Platonic invention, and the ground assigned for the distinction, seem equally unauthenticated. It occurs also in Isocrates, <foreign lang="greek">κατὰ τῶν Σοφιστῶν</foreign> &sect; 21, for &lsquo;the practice of rhetoric&rsquo; in general, also Panath. &sect; 2, Phil. &sect; 26; and amongst the later writers, in Plutarch and Lucian: <foreign lang="greek">ῥητορεύειν</foreign>, in Plato, Isocrates, and Rhet. ad Alex. 36 (37), 35. </p>

The objects of sense and observation from which we derive our inductions and examples are &lsquo;nearer to us&rsquo;, more readily apprehensible by us, than the universals of the syllogism: and therefore, Top. A 12, 105 <hi rend="italic">a</hi> 16, <foreign lang="greek">ἔστι δ’  ἡ μὲν ἐπαγωγὴ πιθανώτερον καὶ σαφέστερον καὶ κατὰ τὴν αἴσθησιν γνωριμώτερον καὶ τοῖς πολλοῖς κοινόν, ὁ δὲ συλλογισμὸς βιαστικώτερον καὶ πρὸς τοὺς ἀντιλογικοὺς ἐνεργέστερον</foreign>, &lsquo;induction is a mode of reasoning which is clearer (to us) and more persuasive, because its materials are better known to us&rsquo;, the example must be familiar and well known or it will not produce its effect in the way of proof; also some kind of induction is constantly used by every one, <foreign lang="greek">τοῖς πολλοῖς κοινόν</foreign>; the syllogism and enthymeme are more &lsquo;cogent&rsquo; and &lsquo;effective&rsquo; against an adversary in a debate, and are therefore &lsquo;more applauded&rsquo;, <foreign lang="greek">θορυβοῦνται δὲ μᾶλλον οἱ ἐνθυμηματικοί</foreign>. </p>
						<p>There is no real contradiction between what is here said and in Probl. XVIII 3. In the Problem the question is <hi rend="italic">why</hi> people in general are better pleased with examples than with enthymemes, the fact being assumed. The answer is, that they learn more from them, and are therefore more amused, and the facts which are adduced by way of examples are more familiar and interesting; the enthymeme (as the syllogism in the Topics) proceeds from universals, which we are less acquainted with than with particulars. Consequently, examples are more pleasing and therefore plausible (<foreign lang="greek">πιθανά</foreign>), whilst the conclusive <pb n="39"/> argument, the enthymeme which leaves the adversary without reply, is more striking, and therefore more applauded. </p>
						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">θορυβεῖσθαι</lemma>, &lsquo;to be applauded&rsquo;, is a regular formation of the passive. For although the usual construction of <foreign lang="greek">θορυβεῖν</foreign> is with <foreign lang="greek">ἐπί</foreign> and the dative, many examples of the transitive use of it are found. See the examples of both, and of the passive, in Ast's Lex. Plat. Isocr. Panath. &sect; 233, (<foreign lang="greek">ὁ λόγος</foreign>) <foreign lang="greek">ἐπῃνήμενος ἦν καὶ τεθορυβημένος</foreign>: and Rhet.

The words <foreign lang="greek">συλλογίζεσθαι</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">συνάγειν</foreign> being very nearly synonymous, some one may have added in the margin <foreign lang="greek">ἢ οὕτως· ἐνδέχεται δὲ συμβουλεύειν</foreign>&mdash; meaning that we might read <foreign lang="greek">συμβουλεὑειν</foreign> in place of <foreign lang="greek">συλλογίζεσθαι</foreign> to avoid the tautology, <foreign lang="greek">συμβουλεύειν</foreign> referring to the deliberative branch of Rhetoric, or public speaking: <foreign lang="greek">ἢ οὕτως</foreign>, &lsquo;or thus&rsquo;, merely expressing the possibility of a <hi rend="italic">various reading</hi>, <foreign lang="greek">ἐνδέχεται δὲ συμβουλεύειν</foreign>. The essential stop after <foreign lang="greek">οὕτως</foreign> was then omitted or overlooked, and the words finally introduced into the text as an appendage to <foreign lang="greek">πλέον</foreign>, with the sense, as rendered by Gaisford, &lsquo;nihil enim amplius profici potest, quam quod sic deliberatur: i. e. incassum enim instituitur ista (altera) consultatio&rsquo;. </p>

Jelf, <hi rend="italic">Gr.

Buttmann also in his <hi rend="italic">Gr. Gr.</hi> &sect; 119 and p. 294 (Engl. Transl.) assumes a distinction between some varieties of them, which is not very clearly made out. They fall under three heads, first desideratives, second imitatives (as <pb n="46"/> <foreign lang="greek">τυραννιᾷν</foreign>, to play the tyrant); &ldquo;but,&rdquo; he adds, &ldquo;it is improper to rank verbs denoting <hi rend="italic">diseases</hi> (the third), <foreign lang="greek">ὀφθαλμιᾷν, ὑδεριᾷν, ψωρᾷν</foreign>, &amp;c., in the same class (as the imitatives);&rdquo; these belong rather to a preceding division, viz. verbs in <foreign lang="greek">αω</foreign> formed from nouns, &ldquo;and expressing, chiefly, the having a thing or quality, and performing an action; as <foreign lang="greek">κομᾷν, χολᾷν, βοᾷν, γοᾷν, τολμᾷν</foreign>.&rdquo; </p>
						<p>A much better and more exact account of these forms of verbs, in respect of the connexion and distinction of their senses, is to be found in Lobeck's learned note on Phrynichus, p. 79&mdash;83. &ldquo;Verbs in <foreign lang="greek">ᾷν</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">ιᾷν</foreign>,&rdquo; (this is not true of <hi rend="italic">all</hi> these verbs and requires qualification; <foreign lang="greek">δαμᾷν, γειτνιᾷν, περᾷν</foreign>, for instance, can hardly be said to denote either a bodily, or mental affection. It should be &ldquo;<hi rend="italic">some</hi> verbs&rdquo; or &ldquo;a large class of verbs in <foreign lang="greek">αω</foreign>&rdquo;) &ldquo;in <hi rend="italic">both</hi> forms, are properly used of affections of mind and body. <foreign lang="greek">σπληνιᾷν, τὸν σπλῆνα ἀλγεῖν, λιθιᾷν, κριθιᾷν, μολυβδιᾷν</foreign> express bodily ailments; <foreign lang="greek">δυσερωτιᾷν, νυμφιᾷν, πασχητιᾷν</foreign>, and all <hi rend="italic">desideratives</hi> (which have either of these terminations) express some affections of the mind, either as a malady, a longing, or in some other form.&rdquo; This is an amplification of what Lobeck actually says: and it is <hi rend="italic">also</hi> I think implied that the bodily affection is the primary signification, which is extended by metaphor to the mental. A long list of examples is there given, chiefly of rarer words. I have collected some examples from various Greek writers, which, as most of them do not appear in Lobeck's list, or in the grammars, I will here add. </p>

					<p>The triple division of Rhetoric, <foreign lang="greek">συμβουλευτικόν, δικανικόν, ἐπιδεικτικόν</foreign>, is, as we learn from Quintilian, II 21, 23, III 4, 1, and 7, 1, due to Aristotle: Anaximenes, his predecessor, had admitted only two <hi rend="italic">genera</hi>, with seven <hi rend="italic">species</hi> subordinate to these, III 4, 9. </p>
					<p>Almost all writers (<hi rend="italic">prope omnes</hi>) on the subject, subsequent to Aristotle, had accepted his division, as proceeding from the &lsquo;highest authority&rsquo; (<hi rend="italic">utique summae apud antiquos auctoritatis</hi>) III 4, 1. Quintilian in this fourth chapter mentions, besides Aristotle's division, those which were adopted by Anaximenes, Protagoras, Plato (in the Sophist), and Isocrates. He decides in favour of Aristotle's, as the safest to follow, both because the preponderance of authority is on its side, and also because it is the most reasonable. <pb n="52"/> </p>

						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">θεωρὸν ἢ κριτήν</lemma>] This classification of the different kinds of &lsquo;audience&rsquo; is made for the purpose of determining the divisions of Rhetoric; because, the audience being the end and object of the speech, that to which every speech is ultimately referred, and everything being defined or determined by its end (<foreign lang="greek">τέλος</foreign>, Eth. Nic. III 10, 1115 <hi rend="italic">b</hi> 23), the number of the varieties of audiences must fix the number of the divisions or branches of Rhetoric. Audiences are of two kinds; either mere &lsquo;spectators&rsquo;, like the <foreign lang="greek">θεαταί</foreign> in a theatre, at the games, or in any exhibition where amusement is the object, or at all events where there is no interest of a <hi rend="italic">practical</hi> character or tendency<note anchored="yes">Thuc. III. 38 (Cleon to the Athenian assembly), <foreign lang="greek">αἴτιοι δ’  ὑμεῖς κακῶς ἀγωνοθετοῦντες, οἵτινες εἰώθατε θεαταὶ μὲν τῶν λόγων γίγνεσθαι, ἀκροαταὶ δὲ τῶν ἔργων, κ.τ.λ.</foreign> &ldquo;You go to the public assembly as you go to the theatre, merely in quest of intellectual excitement. You go as <foreign lang="greek">θεαταί</foreign> or <foreign lang="greek">θεωροί</foreign>, that is, merely for your amusement; and not as <foreign lang="greek">κριταί</foreign>, that is, carefully weighing the matter of what is said, in order to adopt it in your practice or reject it.&rdquo; Arnold.</note>; or else &lsquo;judges&rsquo;, where some real interest is at stake, and they are called upon to pronounce a decision (<hi rend="italic">pars negotialis</hi>, <foreign lang="greek">πραγματική</foreign> Quint.). But these decisions, and those who pronounce them, again fall into two classes, according as they are referred to questions, (1) of political expediency and look to the <hi rend="italic">future</hi>, or (2) of right or wrong in respect of <hi rend="italic">past</hi> acts or facts. </p>
						<p>So that we have three kinds of audiences, and consequently three branches of Rhetoric. The public or national assembly, to which the <hi rend="italic">deliberative</hi> kind of rhetoric is addressed; the law-courts and their &lsquo;judges&rsquo;, properly so called, the object of the <hi rend="italic">forensic</hi> or <hi rend="italic">judicial</hi> branch of the art; and thirdly the &lsquo;spectators&rsquo;, those who go to be amused or interested by the show-speeches, or <foreign lang="greek">ἐπιδείξεις</foreign>, the Panegyrics (in two senses), funeral orations, burlesques, or whatever other form may be taken by speeches composed merely to display skill in composition without practical interest (where the <foreign lang="greek">δύναμις</foreign>, the faculty, or skill shewn, is only in question); or, if they please, to criticise them, and so become &lsquo;critics&rsquo;. </p>
						<p>The term <foreign lang="greek">κριτής</foreign>, &lsquo;judge&rsquo;, which belongs properly only to the second of the three branches, may also be extended to the other two, since they all have to &lsquo;decide&rsquo; in some sense, to choose between opposite views, either on questions of expediency in matters of state, or right and wrong in legal questions, or the merits of a composition as &lsquo;critics&rsquo;.

						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">διὰ τὸ μήτε...πολλῷ δέ</lemma>...] Wolf and MS A^{c} have <foreign lang="greek">πολλῷ τε</foreign>, which is of course the more regular and strictly grammatical usage. On the general question of the meaning and distinctions of <foreign lang="greek">καί, δέ</foreign>, and <foreign lang="greek">τε</foreign>, with and without the negative, see Hermann's excellent dissertation in his Review of Elmsley's Medea, on lines 4, 5. Porson, Elmsley, and their English followers were in the habit of laying down rigorous and inflexible rules of Greek grammar, which were supposed to admit of no exception; any apparent violation of them was to be summarily emended: one of the great services rendered by Hermann to the study of the Greek language is the relaxation of these over exact rules, and the substitution of a rational and logical explanation of these differences of expression, and the analysis of their distinctions, for these often unwarranted alterations of the text. &lsquo;<foreign lang="greek">Καὶ</foreign> particula est coniunctiva&rsquo;, says Hermann; &lsquo;<foreign lang="greek">τε</foreign> adiunctiva; <foreign lang="greek">δέ</foreign> disiunctiva&rsquo;. In the case of <foreign lang="greek">οὐδέ</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">μηδέ, οὔτε</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">μήτε</foreign>, when several things are subordinated to, and included under, one negative conception, the one or the other (<foreign lang="greek">δέ</foreign> or <foreign lang="greek">τε</foreign>) is used according as the writer had or had not any notion of a <hi rend="italic">difference</hi> between them. If the things under the general negative conception are represented <hi rend="italic">merely</hi> as subordinate and with no expression of difference of opposition between them, the <hi rend="italic">adnexive</hi> <foreign lang="greek">τε</foreign> is employed, and the formula is <foreign lang="greek">οὐ...τε...τε</foreign>, or <foreign lang="greek">οὐ...οὔτε...οὔτε</foreign>, and similarly with <foreign lang="greek">μή</foreign>: on the other hand, if some difference between any of the subordinate members of the division is to be marked, <foreign lang="greek">τε</foreign> must be replaced by <foreign lang="greek">δέ</foreign>, and the formula will be <foreign lang="greek">οὐ...οὐδέ</foreign>, or <foreign lang="greek">οὐδέ...οὐδέ</foreign>, or <foreign lang="greek">οὐ... οὔτε...οὔτε...οὐδέ</foreign>, and so on for other similar cases. And the change of <foreign lang="greek">τε</foreign> into <foreign lang="greek">δέ</foreign> in the second clause of the sentence before us, represents the sudden occurrence to the writer's mind of the thought that there is an important difference between the two things that are assigned as reasons for not introducing a regular scientific division into the treatment of Rhetoric (viz. its necessarily unscientific character, and the fact that its <pb n="60"/> province has already been unduly extended by previous professors), which requires to be marked, and accordingly is marked by the change of the particle. This, however, is not the only irregularity in Aristotle's sentence; for, evidently intending at the commencement to include both the subordinate members under the original negative, he introduces in the second clause a positive conception; contributing perhaps to enforce the distinction of the two, but in violation of grammatical accuracy. </p>

						<p>It may be as well here to sum up the characteristics of Rhetoric which respectively entitle it to the name of &lsquo;art&rsquo; and &lsquo;faculty&rsquo;. In so far as it is systematic, and follows a method&mdash;a logical method&mdash;and can look forward to results (implying a knowledge of causes and effects) in <hi rend="italic">persuading</hi> its hearers, it is an art; as a practical exercise, not admitting of absolute exactness, or universal conclusions, employing the propositions of all arts and sciences, and the axioms common to them all, only as probable and popular, and having itself no special subject-matter, taking opposite sides of the same question indifferently and arriving at opposite conclusions (so Alexander Aphrodisiensis), it is a <foreign lang="greek">δύναμις</foreign>, a faculty, capable of development and to be exercised in practice. </p>

And his view is so far supported by the Paraphrast, who also rejects them. Brandis, u. s. p. 46. No one but himself, however, would prefer to connect <foreign lang="greek">εἰς ἐπιστήμας</foreign> with <foreign lang="greek">ἐπισκευάζων</foreign> rather than <foreign lang="greek">μεταβαίνειν</foreign>&mdash;a much more natural construction, though this often is certainly admissible&mdash;and secondly, the two words, though not absolutely necessary to the sense, are at least in perfect accordance with it when the passage is properly interpreted. &lsquo;In proportion as...he will be unconsciously, unintentionally, effacing their real nature by passing over, in his attempt to reconstruct them (alter their formation or system), into sciences of definite special subjects, instead of those (<foreign lang="greek">ἐπιστήμας</foreign>) which deal with mere words&rsquo;, i.e. <hi rend="italic">instead of confining himself</hi> to these latter.

Tacit., Proleg. <hi rend="italic">de Stili Taciti brevitate</hi>, p. LXXVIII sq., <foreign lang="greek">σύλληψις</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">ζεῦγμα</foreign> proper.

In <foreign lang="greek">σύλληψις</foreign> the two terms are united in one construction with a third, to which one is referred <hi rend="italic">literally</hi>, the other <hi rend="italic">metaphorically</hi>, or at all events in different senses. This appears in the instances given, as <hi rend="italic">dissimulationem nox et lascivia exemerat: nocte ac laetitia incaluisse: praeda famaque onusti: mixti copiis et laetitia.</hi> To these I will venture to add from a modern English writer the case of Miss Bolo in <hi rend="italic">Pickwick</hi>, who after her defeat at whist in the Bath Assembly Rooms retires &lsquo;<hi rend="italic">in</hi> a flood of tears <hi rend="italic">and</hi> a sedan chair&rsquo;; to which Eur. Hel. 182, <foreign lang="greek">αὐγαῖσιν ἐν ταῖς χρυσέαις ἔν τε δόνακος ἔρνεσιν</foreign>, is an exact parallel. In <foreign lang="greek">ζεῦγμα</foreign> proper, this third term will not apply in <hi rend="italic">any sense</hi> to <hi rend="italic">both</hi> of the others, and some other word or phrase must necessarily be <hi rend="italic">supplied</hi> to complete the sense; as in the passage of Herodotus quoted above, and in the text of Aristotle.

It seems to represent something quite different from the other; but what? The <foreign lang="greek">ζεῦγμα</foreign> in fact is a kind of grammatical bracket, under which two heterogeneous expressions are improperly included. Another well-known example of this <hi rend="italic">figure</hi> is the truly Irish epitaph on Boyle the Philosopher: &lsquo;He was the father of Chemistry, and grand-uncle of the Earl of Cork.&rsquo;</note> (a mere carelessness of expression dignified by <pb n="62"/> that name), &lsquo;a figure of speech&rsquo;, as it is briefly expressed in Liddell and Scott's Lexicon, &lsquo;wherein two subjects <hi rend="italic">are used jointly</hi> with the same predicate, which strictly belongs only to one, as in Il.

I 90, <foreign lang="greek">χρηστὰ ἔργα καὶ ἔπεα ποιέειν</foreign>, where of course <foreign lang="greek">λέγειν</foreign> is required with <foreign lang="greek">ἔπεα</foreign>.

						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ἐπισκευάζειν</lemma>, &lsquo;to re-construct or re-constitute&rsquo;, is opposed to <foreign lang="greek">κατασκευάζειν</foreign>.

Hence <foreign lang="greek">ἐπισκευάζειν</foreign> is properly to &lsquo;refit&rsquo;, &lsquo;renew&rsquo;, &lsquo;repair&rsquo;, &lsquo;restore&rsquo;, as walls, ships, bridges, roads (Thucyd., Xenoph., Demosth., see the Lexx.), and thence transferred to &lsquo;reconstruction&rsquo; of a science or study.

Its scientific character, which entitles it to the epithet &lsquo;demonstrative&rsquo;, <foreign lang="greek">ἱστορία ἀποδεικτική</foreign>, II 37, 3, <foreign lang="greek">ἀποδ. διήγησις</foreign>, IV 40, 1, is derived from its method of tracing causes and motives of actions: <foreign lang="greek">ἱστορίας γὰρ ἐὰν ἀφέλῃ τις τὸ διὰ τί, καὶ πῶς, καὶ τίνος χάριν ἐπράχθη, καὶ τὸ πραχθὲν πότερα εὔλογον ἔσχε τὸ τέλος, τὸ καταλειπόμενον αὐτῆς ἀγώνισμα μὲν μάθημα δὲ οὐ γίγνεται· καὶ παραυτίκα μὲν τέρπει, πρὸς δὲ τὸ μέλλον οὐδὲν ὠφελεῖ τὸ παράπαν</foreign>. </p>
						<p>But it is only the term, not the thing, that is new in Polybius' time. Thucydides' History, though not so called, (Thucydides is called a <foreign lang="greek">ξυγγραφεύς</foreign>, see Poppo on 1, 1, 2,) is at least as scientific in all essential points as that of Polybius, or indeed any other. </p>

						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ὑπάρξαι, ἀρκεῖν</lemma>, <hi rend="italic">Anonymus</hi>, ap. Brandis, u. s., p. 44. </p>
						<p>The verbs <foreign lang="greek">ὑπάρχειν, εἶναι, γίγνεσθαι</foreign>, stand to one another in the relation of past, present, and future; to be already in existence, to be (simple and absolute being, independent of time), and to become, to come into being from a state (if that be possible) of non-being. The <hi rend="italic">aorist</hi> infin, gives <foreign lang="greek">ὑπάρξαι</foreign> here a future sense, &lsquo;to become or to be made&rsquo;, which does not naturally, <hi rend="italic">ex vi verbi</hi>, belong to it. Hermann, in one of those notes which have thrown so much light upon the niceties of Greek grammar (on Ajax 1061 subsequently referred to without further discussion in the treatise <hi rend="italic">de Part.</hi> <foreign lang="greek">ἄν</foreign> IV, 2, <hi rend="italic">Opuscula</hi>, Vol. IV), contends against Elmsley (who had condemned as a solecism this use of the aorist infin. without <foreign lang="greek">ἄν</foreign>, after verbs such as <foreign lang="greek">δοκεῖν, νομίζειν, οἴεσθαι, φάναι, ἐλπίζειν, προσδοκᾶν</foreign>, in reference to future time) in support of the usage; and distinguishes three modes of expression in which futurity is conveyed by the infinitive: first, the simple future inf. as <foreign lang="greek">δοκεῖν πεσεῖσθαι</foreign>, which conveys directly the simple and absolute notion of futurity, without modification or qualification; second, the infin., aorist or present, with <foreign lang="greek">ἄν, πίπτειν ἄν, πεσεῖν ἄν</foreign>, which indicates a merely conditional futurity, might or would fall, under certain circumstances or conditions; and thirdly, the present or aorist infin. without <foreign lang="greek">ἄν, πίπτειν</foreign>, or <foreign lang="greek">πεσεῖν</foreign>, which, corresponding to the indefinite (in point of time) present and aorist, <foreign lang="greek">πίπτει</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">ἔπεσε</foreign>, denote simply the possibility or likelihood of the object falling at some uncertain future time; <hi rend="italic">caducum esse.</hi> The distinction between the <hi rend="italic">present</hi> and <hi rend="italic">aorist</hi> infinitive is this: &lsquo;Praesentis autem et aoristi infinitivis, sive accedat <foreign lang="greek">ἄν</foreign> sive non, ita utuntur, ut aoristus rei transeunti, praesens duranti adhibeatur.&rsquo; </p>
						<p>Without disputing the truth of this, it is yet possible to explain the difference otherwise. <hi rend="italic">Permanence</hi> (&lsquo;duranti&rsquo;) does not seem to me to be in any way connected with the conception of present time, though the perfect often is; as when we say &lsquo;this <hi rend="italic">has been</hi>&rsquo; up to the present time, we often imply our belief in its continuance; and I should rather explain the present infin. in these cases as expressing the mere fact of the existence of the thing named, or the abstract notion of it. The present tense, as it is called, I act, I do, to act, to do, is in reality independent of time: the time present is, I am acting, I am doing; and the present infin. &lsquo;to do&rsquo; is the naked conception of &lsquo;doing&rsquo; without any connotation of time (so the <hi rend="italic">present</hi> infinit. with the definite article stands for a <hi rend="italic">substantive;</hi> <foreign lang="greek">τὸ εἶναι</foreign> is the mere notion of being). The aorist infin. again may derive its notion of futurity and likelihood, either, as Hermann thinks, from the indefiniteness expressed by the tense, or, in other cases, from the connotation of <hi rend="italic">habit</hi>, implying <hi rend="italic">liability</hi>, which is also one of its acquired senses. The broad distinction will be, <foreign lang="greek">δοκῶ πεσεῖσθαι</foreign>, &lsquo;I think it <hi rend="italic">will</hi> fall&rsquo;, at some future time, and nothing more: <foreign lang="greek">δοκῶ πίπτειν</foreign> or <foreign lang="greek">πεσεῖν ἄν</foreign>, &lsquo;I think it <hi rend="italic">could, would</hi>, or <hi rend="italic">might</hi> fall&rsquo;, under certain conditions; <foreign lang="greek">δοκῶ πίπτειν</foreign>, &lsquo;I think the notion of falling belongs to it&rsquo;, &lsquo;I think it <hi rend="italic">may</hi> fall&rsquo;; that is, that it is <hi rend="italic">liable</hi>, or <hi rend="italic">likely</hi>, to fall, <hi rend="italic">caducum esse</hi>: and <foreign lang="greek">δοκῶ πεσεῖν</foreign>, implying also the liability or likelihood of the preceding, is distinguished from it (according to Hermann) by <pb n="66"/> representing the act or event as transient and not permanent. But such a distinction as this last, though it be intelligible, is at least untranslatable; as in such a case as <foreign lang="greek">νοεῖς δρᾶσαι</foreign> (Soph. Phil. 918), &lsquo;what dost thou intend to do&rsquo;, where the expression of the liability must needs be omitted, and still more the transient nature of the proposed act. But we can hardly suppose that any distinction can be seriously intended when Sophocles writes <foreign lang="greek">νοεῖς δρᾶσαι</foreign>: and then, three lines afterwards, v. 921, <foreign lang="greek">δρᾷν νοεῖς</foreign>. The choice between the two seems to be dictated rather by convenience than by any other motive. </p>
						<p>With regard to the distinction of the present and aorist infin., it may be observed, that we are often obliged, as the practice of translation shews, to disregard whatever difference there may be conceived to be between them, as either inappreciable or at all events inexpressible, and to render them by the same English words. Take, for example, the ordinary phrase <foreign lang="greek">δεῖ λαβεῖν</foreign> (it occurs, for instance, II 8, 12). It is quite certain that in this case past time is not directly signified; though it may possibly be included as an accessory in the notion of it in the way of an addition to the abstract conception of &lsquo;taking up, acquiring&rsquo;&mdash;as representing the <hi rend="italic">previous formation</hi> of the opinion, which has been <hi rend="italic">taken up</hi> before. But at all events no one would think of <hi rend="italic">translating</hi> <foreign lang="greek">δεῖ λαβεῖν</foreign> in any other form than that of the simple verb &lsquo;to assume or suppose&rsquo;. </p>
						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ἥ τις ἐνδέχεται] ἐνδέχεσθαι</lemma> is here used, as is customary with other writers, as a personal verb; Aristotle generally employs it as an impersonal. Comp. note on c. 2, 14. </p>

						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">εἰρηνεύηται] εἰρηνεύειν</lemma>, though used as a neuter in Plat.

						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">πλεονεκτεῖν ἢ ἐλαττοῦσθαι</lemma>] properly contrasted. <foreign lang="greek">πλέον ἢ ἔλαττον ἔχειν</foreign>, &lsquo;to have too much or too little&rsquo;, &lsquo;more or less than your due&rsquo;. So in Thucyd. I 77, <foreign lang="greek">ἐλασσοῦσθαι</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">πλεονεκτεῖσθαι</foreign> (the irregular passive of <foreign lang="greek">πλεονεκτεῖν</foreign>) represent the same notion, &lsquo;to come by the worse, or to be overreached&rsquo;.

That the laws ought to be supreme in a state, and not any one or several, or the entire body of citizens, is argued and concluded in Polit. III 15, 1286 <hi rend="italic">a</hi> 7 seq. and again c. 16, 1287 <hi rend="italic">a</hi> 18, <foreign lang="greek">τὸν ἄρα νόμον ἄρχειν αἱρετώτερον μᾶλλον ἢ τῶν πολιτῶν ἕνα τινά κ.τ.λ.</foreign> The different forms of constitutions, and what is salutary and conservative or destructive of each of them, are treated, for instance, in Pol. III 6, and VIII (V) 1 et seq. And not only is the substance of the next sentence, <foreign lang="greek">λέγω δὲ τὸ ὑπὸ οἰκείων φθείρεσθαι κ.τ.λ.</foreign>, found in the discussions of the Politics VIII (V) 1, but the very same metaphor, from the tightening and relaxation of the strings of the lyre, is employed there, 1301 <hi rend="italic">b</hi> 17, as here; and in c. 9, 1309 <hi rend="italic">b</hi> 18, the same illustration, derived from the flat and aquiline nose, is used to represent the excessive exaggeration and intensification, or depression and relaxation of the constitution, as of the feature, which altogether effaces its true character. </p>
						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ἀνιέμεναι καὶ ἐπιτεινόμεναι</lemma>] This metaphor from the screwing up or relaxation of the strings of the lyre, producing a difference of musical pitch or tone, which it raises or lowers, is a very favourite one both with Plato and Aristotle, and is used to represent, as I have already said, exaggeration or intensification on the one hand, (exactly as we speak of &lsquo;screwing up our courage&rsquo; <hi rend="italic">Macbeth</hi> I 7, 60), and depression or relaxation on the other. If for example the nose is lowered or depressed to excess in the way of flatness as a snub-nose, or exaggerated in the other direction to excessive sharpness and prominence as an aquiline nose, it ends by losing the character of a nose altogether, and is either altogether effaced or becomes a beak: and so with the constitutions of states. </p>
						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">τὸ ὑπὸ οἰκείων φθείρεσθαι</lemma> therefore means that forms of government are destroyed or change their character by the exaggeration or relaxation of their own proper and peculiar institutions, and it is in the &lsquo;mean&rsquo; state alone between these two excesses that the constitution can be said to maintain its true character. For instance the <foreign lang="greek">ὅρος</foreign>, definition or principle, of a democracy is equality; if this be intensified or exaggerated, or carried to excess, if the thing be logically carried out, and everybody actually becomes equal, the government degenerates into mob-rule or anarchy and thus loses its true democratic character; if it be relaxed and the equality diminished, the democratic principle and its institutions become <pb n="70"/> so enfeebled, that the inequalities increase until at last it becomes an oligarchy, <foreign lang="greek">ἀνιεμένη ἀσθενεστέρα γίνεται ὥστε τέλος ἥξει εἰς ὀλιγαρχίαν</foreign>. </p>

On the definition of Rhetoric, see Introd. p. 13; and on <hi rend="italic">this</hi> definition of happiness, p. 176. </p>
						<p>Aristotle's own definition of happiness in the Eth. Nic., the result of his inquiries in that work, is something far different, <foreign lang="greek">ἐνέργεια ψυχῆς κατ’  ἀρετήν</foreign>, the fully developed activity or active exercise (implying full consciousness) of the soul in respect of its proper (and therefore highest) excellence: that is contemplation, <foreign lang="greek">θεωρία</foreign>, the exercise of the highest faculty, the <foreign lang="greek">νοῦς</foreign>, or intuitive reason; the highest faculties being the <hi rend="italic">intellectual.</hi> This is the theory; but practically a lower view of happiness is admitted (Bk. X), which consists in the exercise of the moral as well as the intellectual virtues. Of the definitions here given, <foreign lang="greek">αὐτάρκεια ζωῆς</foreign> comes nearest to his own: it expresses a self-sufficing life, complete in itself, independent of all external aids and advantages, and is in fact essential to the notion of happiness. See Eth. Nic. I 5 (quoted below). </p>
						<p>The essentials of the three first of these definitions are found all united in the conception of happiness, the ultimate end of all human desire and effort, which forms the conclusion of the tenth book of the Nicomachean Ethics, from the sixth chapter to the end. It contains first, the <foreign lang="greek">εὐπραξία μετ’  ἀρετῆς</foreign>, in the exercise of moral and intellectual virtue, the intellectual being the higher and more perfect form of it, and in that the intuitive contemplative energy; secondly, the <foreign lang="greek">αὐτάρκεια τῆς ζωῆς</foreign>, the self-sufficiency and independence of everything external, which is necessary to perfection and happiness; and thirdly, the life <foreign lang="greek">μετ’  ἀσφαλείας</foreign>, the happiness residing in <foreign lang="greek">θεωρία</foreign> being most secure because it is most independent and the nearest approach to the happiness of the Gods, who have all their wants and faculties satisfied in themselves, and want nothing &lt;*&gt;m without (c. 7); and also  <foreign lang="greek">ἥδιστος</foreign>, because pleasure is the necessary accompaniment of <pb n="74"/> every <foreign lang="greek">ἐνέργεια</foreign> (active exercise, <hi rend="italic">realisation</hi> in exercise, of any <foreign lang="greek">δύναμις</foreign> or capacity), and <foreign lang="greek">θεωρία</foreign> being the most perfect form of <foreign lang="greek">ἐνέργεια</foreign>, the pleasure that accompanies it must needs be the highest and most complete; and the exercise of the moral faculties in proportion to their comparative excellence. <foreign lang="greek">καὶ τῷ ἀνθρώπῳ δὴ ὁ κατὰ τὸν νοῦν βίος</foreign> (<foreign lang="greek">ἥδιστος καὶ κράτιστος</foreign>), <foreign lang="greek">εἴπερ τοῦτο μάλιστα ἄνθρωπος. οὗτος ἄρα καὶ εὐδαιμονέστατος</foreign>. Eth. N. X 7 ult. (In the popular and lower sense of the words this definition of happiness would belong to the <hi rend="italic">Epicurean</hi> school.) The fourth definition, <foreign lang="greek">εὐθηνία κτημάτων καὶ σωμάτων μετὰ δυνάμεως φυλακτικῆς τε καὶ πρακτικῆς τούτων·</foreign> is only applicable to a state.

Or perhaps rather, <foreign lang="greek">γη</foreign> merely &lsquo;land&rsquo; in general, and <foreign lang="greek">χώρια</foreign> the divisions of land, the <hi rend="italic">actual</hi> private properties. </p>
						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ἔπιπλα</lemma>, (a division of property) &lsquo;moveables&rsquo;, moveable furniture or property of all kinds: opposed to &lsquo;fixtures&rsquo;, such as houses and land. Xen. Oecon. IX 6 includes in it all sacrificial furniture or apparatus; and articles of dress, shoes, female ornaments; and of house furniture, as beds. In Thuc. III 68, <foreign lang="greek">ἃ ἦν ἐν τῷ τείχει ἔπιπλα, χαλκὸς καὶ σίδηρος</foreign>, it stands for household furniture of bronze and iron: everything of this kind which was in the fort, the Laced., after the capture of Plataea, converted into couches (<foreign lang="greek">κλῖναι</foreign>) and dedicated to <foreign lang="greek">Ἥρα</foreign>. In Arist. Pol. II 7, 1267 <hi rend="italic">b</hi> 12, <foreign lang="greek">καὶ κατασκευὴ πολλὴ</foreign> (a large stock) <foreign lang="greek">τῶν καλουμένων ἐπίπλων</foreign>, it is opposed, first, <hi rend="italic">with</hi> money, slaves and cattle, to land, and then, secondly, to the three former. Similarly in the present passage, they are distinguished from cattle and slaves as <hi rend="italic">inanimate</hi> moveable furniture, or &lsquo;plenishing&rsquo;. Herodotus writes the word <foreign lang="greek">ἐπίπλοα</foreign> in I 94; elsewhere, as usual, <foreign lang="greek">ἔπιπλα</foreign>. The derivation appears to be, <foreign lang="greek">τὰ ἐπιπολῆς σκεύη, τὰ ἐπιπόλαια</foreign>, superficial&rsquo;. They are said to be &lsquo;superficial&rsquo;, to &lsquo;lie on the surface&rsquo;, because they are not fixed or rooted, like land, houses, trees; which are all &lsquo;property&rsquo; nevertheless. </p>
						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ταῦτα δὲ πάντα καὶ ἀσφαλῆ καὶ ἐλευθέρια καὶ χρήσιμα</lemma>] All the kinds of property just mentioned are &lsquo;secure&rsquo;, (in the sense, &lsquo;that the use of it is always in your own power&rsquo;, <hi rend="italic">infra</hi>), not liable to risk, as money made and employed in trade or commerce; and &lsquo;liberal&rsquo;, such as befit a gentleman, a man of &lsquo;liberal&rsquo; education and pursuits, cultivated and accomplished and refined, <foreign lang="greek">ὁ πεπαιδευμένος</foreign> (<foreign lang="greek">παιδεία, ᾗ διαγιγνώσκομεν τὰ καλὰ καὶ τὰ αἰσχρά</foreign>, Aesch. c. Ctesiph. &sect; 260); and also &lsquo;useful&rsquo;, <foreign lang="greek">πρὸς τὸ ζῇν καὶ τὸ εὖ ζῇν</foreign>, and therefore a part of genuine <hi rend="italic">wealth</hi> (with which <hi rend="italic">money</hi> is here included, contrary to the true theory). </p>
						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ἐλευθέριος</lemma>, as here applied, expresses the general notion of liberality, in character and habits of mind. In the Ethics, and most frequently in the ordinary language, it is restricted as a moral virtue to a <hi rend="italic">species</hi> of liberality, that namely which manifests itself <foreign lang="greek">περὶ δόσιν χρημάτων καὶ λῆψιν</foreign>. Eth. Nic. II 7. The <foreign lang="greek">ἐλευθέριος</foreign> represents the gentleman <pb n="81"/> from the democratic point of view; he embodies the notion of &lsquo;freedom which is the <foreign lang="greek">ὅρος</foreign>, the principle, and the end and aim of the democratic commonwealth; he is the type of a free citizen, and therefore as expressive of <hi rend="italic">character</hi> the term denotes &lsquo;that which a model free citizen ought to be&rsquo;; and connotes or implies those qualifications, particularly education and enlightenment, which enable him efficiently to discharge the proper functions of a free citizen, and those social qualities and habits which fit him for such a society. This is opposed to the aristocratic conception of a gentleman which makes the character or notion depend rather upon birth, wealth and station; and according to which the <foreign lang="greek">ἀγαθοί, ἄριστοι, ἀριστῆες</foreign>, the <hi rend="italic">boni, optimi, optimates</hi>, &amp;c., are the nobles, the men of rank, and of good family in a state. See further on this subject, Donaldson, <hi rend="italic">New Cratylus</hi>, &sect;&sect; 321&mdash;328. </p>
						<p>Another characteristic of Greek feeling, which deserves notice, is brought into view in the application of the term <foreign lang="greek">ἐλευθέρια</foreign> to distinguish a particular kind of property; and this is, the contempt for trade and commerce as a profession and a means of acquiring wealth, which as B. St Hilaire observes (note on <hi rend="italic">Transl. of Ar. Pol.</hi> p. 36) was common to all antiquity. A similar observation is made by B&ouml;ckh, <hi rend="italic">Publ. Econ. of Athens</hi>, Bk. I c. 8 p. 43 (Transl.). </p>
						<p>Plato's writings abound with contemptuous epithets and expressions applied to <foreign lang="greek">ἐμπορία, καπηλεία, χρηματιστική, χρηματισμός</foreign>, and all arts and professions of which money-making was the only object; for instance, Legg. IV 1, 705 A, <foreign lang="greek">ἐμπορίας γὰρ καὶ χρηματισμοῦ διὰ καπηλείας ἐμπιπλᾶσα αὐτήν, ἤθη παλίμβολα καὶ ἄπιστα ταῖς ψυχαῖς ἐντίκτουσα, αὐτήν τε πρὸς αὐτὴν τὴν πόλιν ἄπιστον καὶ ἄφιλον ποιεῖ καὶ πρὸς τοὺς ἄλλους ἀνθρώπους ὡσαύτως</foreign>, where trade is represented as corrupting and demoralizing. In XI 4, 918 D, in the course of a discussion on the legitimate objects and uses of trade, he makes the remark, <foreign lang="greek">διὸ πάντα τὰ περὶ τὴν καπηλείαν καὶ ἐμπορίαν καὶ πανδοκείαν γένη</foreign> (in the actual practice of them) <foreign lang="greek">διαβέβληταί τε καὶ ἐν αἰσχροῖς γέγονεν ὀνείδεσιν</foreign>, which results from their general tendency to corrupt the character of those who follow these pursuits, by the immoderate desire of gain which they stimulate and foster. Accordingly no citizen of the model state is allowed to follow any retail trade; this must be confined to metics and strangers, <foreign lang="greek">μέτοικον εἶναι χρεὼν ἢ ξένον ὃς ἂν μέλλῃ καπηλεύσειν</foreign>. VIII 11, 847 D, <foreign lang="greek">καπηλείαν δὲ ἕνεκα χρηματισμῶν μήτε οὖν τούτου μήτε ἄλλου μηδενὸς ἐν τῇ χώρᾳ ὅλῃ καὶ πόλει ἡμῖν γίγνεσθαι</foreign>. On Plato's general views on this subject, as expressed in the &lsquo;Laws&rsquo;, see Grote, Plato, III 431. </p>
						<p>Aristotle similarly condemns trade and the business and practice of interchanging commodities, so far as its object is mere money-making, <foreign lang="greek">χρηματιστική</foreign>. This is the accumulation of <hi rend="italic">unnatural</hi>, artificial property: the only kind of property or wealth that is natural, <foreign lang="greek">φύσει</foreign>, is that which can be applied directly to one's own use, <foreign lang="greek">πρὸς χρῆσιν</foreign>, and ultimately <foreign lang="greek">πρὸς τὸ εὖ ζῇν</foreign>, and falls under the province of <foreign lang="greek">οἰκοναμική</foreign>, from which <foreign lang="greek">χρηματιστική</foreign> is excluded. Pol. I 9. Hence of the two kinds of <foreign lang="greek">κτητική</foreign>, the one, which may be called <foreign lang="greek">οἰκονομική</foreign>, because it forms part of the science of &oelig;conomics (domestic economy) properly understood, is neces<pb n="82"/> sary and laudable; the other, <foreign lang="greek">ἡ καπηλική</foreign> or <foreign lang="greek">μεταβλητική</foreign>, with its offspring usury, which <hi rend="italic">breeds</hi> money out of money, and is thence called <foreign lang="greek">τόκος</foreign>, &lsquo;is justly reprehended&rsquo; and usury &lsquo;most reasonably the object of abhorrence&rsquo;. <foreign lang="greek">τῆς δὲ μεταβλητικῆς ψεγομένης δικαίως, οὐ γὰρ κατὰ φύσιν ἀλλ’  ἀπ̓ ἀλλήλων ἐστίν, εὐλογώτατα μισεῖται ἡ ὀβολοστατικὴ διὰ τὸ ὑπ̓ αὐτοῦ τοῦ νομίσματος εἶναι τὴν κτῆσιν καὶ οὐκ ἐφ̓ ὅπερ ἐπορίσθη. κ.τ.λ.</foreign> I 10 sub fin. </p>
						<p>On the character and tendencies of <foreign lang="greek">ἔμποροι</foreign>, compare Xen. Oecon. XX 27, 28. In the same treatise, c. I 12, 13, 14, a distinction is taken, similar to that of Aristotle, between <foreign lang="greek">χρήματα</foreign>, wealth or property which you can <hi rend="italic">use</hi> directly, which does you direct service, and money, which is excluded from the notion of property <hi rend="italic">in this sense.</hi> Xenophon, like Aristotle, approves of nothing but the agricultural mode of life as the best both for mind and body, and as cultivating and promoting the habits which go to form the best of citizens. See Oecon. c. VI 8, 9, 10, c. XV 9. </p>
						<p>These extracts will throw light upon the meaning of the word <foreign lang="greek">ἐλευθέρια</foreign> as applied to the land and stock and buildings and moveables of the landed gentleman or country proprietor. They are said to belong to the gentleman or man of cultivation, in contrast with the degrading or corrupting habits engendered by trade and commerce. </p>
						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ἔστι δὲ χρήσιμα μᾶλλον κ.τ.λ.</lemma>] Property employed in business, and therefore productive, <foreign lang="greek">ἀφ’  ὧν αἱ πρόσοδοι</foreign> &lsquo;from which one derives one's income&rsquo;, is more useful, but carries with it the notion of sordidness or meanness; the other, because it produces nothing but the <hi rend="italic">enjoyment</hi><note anchored="yes"><foreign lang="greek">ἀπόλαυσις</foreign> is properly &lsquo;sensual enjoyment&rsquo;. In Eth. N. 1 3, where the three kinds of lives, the <foreign lang="greek">ἀπολαυστικός, πρακτικός</foreign> or <foreign lang="greek">πολιτικός</foreign>, and <foreign lang="greek">θεωρητικός</foreign> are distinguished and compared, the first is that which has <foreign lang="greek">ἡδονή</foreign> for its sole object, the gratification of the animal appetites and desires, the satisfaction of <foreign lang="greek">τὸ ἐπιθυμητικόν</foreign>; the second has <foreign lang="greek">ἀρετή</foreign> moral virtue for its <foreign lang="greek">τέλος</foreign>; the third, <foreign lang="greek">θεωρία</foreign>, the highest activity of the intellect.</note>, which proceeds from <hi rend="italic">using</hi> it, because it is not corrupted and degraded by any contact or connexion with money-making, better befits the cultivated man, who should hold himself aloof from such pursuits, and partakes more of the notion of <foreign lang="greek">καλόν</foreign>.

(If there were any such connexion between the two, the meaning could only be, that the relation of strength and speed as <hi rend="italic">genus</hi> and <hi rend="italic">species</hi>, speed being only a variety of strength, is the reason for the introduction of <foreign lang="greek">τάχος</foreign> into the list of agonistic virtues: the <hi rend="italic">fact</hi> being that this could only be a reason for omitting it.) </p>

See also Lobeck, Aj. 239, p. 177<note anchored="yes">Lobeck in his elaborate dissertation on the question seems to leave the matter in doubt; and no doubt, from the uncertainty of the MSS readings, the distinction of the two forms of the verb being shewn in most cases merely by the difference of accent, it is difficult to decide in any particular case which of the two forms is to be preferred: and Lobeck shews by examples that (so far as the reading is to be depended on) the same notion of the verb is expressed indifferently by either form. At the same time in the somewhat obscure summing up at the conclusion of his note, he seems (as I understand him) to be in favour, as a general principle, of the hypothesis, that a difference of form in the termination of a verb radically the same (he cites <foreign lang="greek">ἴλλω</foreign> or <foreign lang="greek">εἴλλω</foreign> and its numerous varieties as a remarkable instance) <hi rend="italic">does</hi> express a corresponding variety in the signification; as in the instance given, the various terminations correspond to different varieties of the general notion of &lsquo;rolling&rsquo;.</note>. This distinction, which has been doubted by some scholars, is now I believe generally accepted. At all events it applies very well here, where the simple notion of flinging or hurling, once for all, from you, as a stone, would be quite inappropriate to the motion of the legs intended to be described. <foreign lang="greek">ῥιπτεῖν τὰ σκέλη</foreign> is to &lsquo;toss about&rsquo; or &lsquo;swing the legs&rsquo;, backwards and forwards, again and again. </p>

In this definition, friendship or love is described as a state of mind, a moral habit or disposition, not as a natural affection. The desire of doing our friend good for his own sake is a necessary accompaniment and consequence of the feeling or affection, but not identical with it. The definition is &lsquo;rhetorical&rsquo;, and does not give the &lsquo;essence&rsquo; of the thing, as a scientific definition would. The definition of <foreign lang="greek">φιλία</foreign> as a <foreign lang="greek">πάθος</foreign>, II 4, 2, is in exact conformity with this, and equally deficient. In the Ethics, VIII 2, after quoting some of the ordinary current notions of love to be found in the preceding poets and philosophers, he proceeds to the establishment of his own. And here again the same conception of it reappears in the words <foreign lang="greek">τῷ δὲ φίλῳ φασὶ δεῖν βούλεσθαι τἀγαθὰ ἐκείνου ἕνεκα</foreign>. Accordingly <foreign lang="greek">φιλία</foreign> is <foreign lang="greek">εὔνοια ἐν ἀντιπεπονθόσι</foreign>, <hi rend="italic">reciprocal</hi> goodwill or affection; the reciprocity being essential to true <foreign lang="greek">φιλία</foreign> or affection of two human beings to one another. For though we may be &lsquo;fond&rsquo; of wine, <foreign lang="greek">φίλοινος</foreign>, or &lsquo;fond&rsquo; of animals, there is in these cases no true reciprocity of affection. Further, since &lsquo;fondness&rsquo; is applicable to three classes of objects, the good, the pleasant, and the useful, three classes of corresponding &lsquo;friendships&rsquo; or &lsquo;fondnesses&rsquo; are hereby determined; but only the first of them, the love of the good, is the basis of true and perfect love; and consequently <pb n="94"/> the highest and perfect form of &lsquo;love&rsquo; can only exist between the good, <foreign lang="greek">τελεία δ’  ἐστὶν ἡ τῶν ἀγαθῶν φιλία καὶ κατ̓ ἀρετὴν ὁμοίων· οὗτοι γὰρ τἀγαθ̓, ὁμοίως βούλονται ἀλλήλοις, ᾗ ἀγαθοί· ἀγαθοὶ δ̓ εἰσὶ καθ̓ αὑτούς</foreign>, c. 4, init.

						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ἔστω δὴ ἀγαθόν κ.τ.λ.</lemma>] The &lsquo;popular&rsquo; character of these definitions is marked by the introductory <foreign lang="greek">ἔστω</foreign>, &lsquo;let it be taken for granted&rsquo;; no demonstration is required, any current notion of good will serve our purpose.

						<p>First, &lsquo;Good is anything that is in itself and for its own sake desirable (an object of choice), and that for whose sake we choose something else (which is the ulterior end of our preference for anything); and that which is the universal aim, either of everything or&rsquo; (as a qualification to exclude inanimate things) &lsquo;everything that has sensation or reason, or (would be their aim) if they were to <hi rend="italic">acquire</hi> the reasoning faculty&rsquo; (supposing they have it not yet, as infants and beasts).

						<p>The first of these two definitions, which represents Good as desirable in and for itself, and as <hi rend="italic">that</hi> to obtain which we choose something else, is in fact identical with the second which describes it as the ultimate end or aim of all action and desire, only differing from it in terms. Every thing that we choose or desire, and every act that we perform, is as the means to one universal end, the Good. This view of the nature of Good is laid down and illustrated in the first chapter of the Nic. Eth. <foreign lang="greek">πᾶσα τέχνη καὶ πᾶσα μέθοδος, ὁμοίως δὲ πρᾶξίς τε καὶ προαίρεσις, ἀγαθοῦ τινὸς ἐφίεσθαι δοκεῖ· διὸ καλῶς ἀπεφήναντο</foreign> (it is a current, popular, definition of) <foreign lang="greek">τἀγαθόν, οὗ πάντ’  ἐφίεταιεἰ δή τι τέλος ἐστι τῶν πρακτῶν ὃ δἰ αὑτὸ βουλόμεθα, τἆλλα δὲ διὰ τοῦτο</foreign> (the means to the universal end) <foreign lang="greek">καὶ μὴ πάντα δἰ ἕτερον αἱρούμεθα</foreign>, (there is <hi rend="italic">something</hi>, i. e.

						<p>The same view of the nature of Good is to be found equally in Plato, from whom Aristotle may have derived it.

That is, all that this supreme or universal reason or the particular reason of each individual, would assign as suitable to each; the former what is good for all alike, the latter what is good for each particular individual; since these sometimes differ: or, as Schrader interprets it, the universal reason that dictates <hi rend="italic">general</hi> principles or rules of action, as contrasted with <foreign lang="greek">ὁ νοῦς ὁ περὶ ἕκαστον</foreign>, <hi rend="italic">mens quae de singularibus decernit</hi>, which decides in special and individual cases.

						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">καὶ τὰ ποιητικὰ τριχῶς</lemma>] This triple division of productive causes or conditions is thus explained by Majoragius. &lsquo;Point tres species rerum conficientium quae ita distingui possunt.

Quae extrinsecus adhibentur aut sunt tanquam instrumenta, aut sunt actiones; instrumenta, ut cibaria:...actiones, ut exercitatio corporis, et deambulatio, quae frequenter bonam valetudinem efficit.&rsquo; This account, though correct in the main, requires a little further explanation and modification. The ground of the distinction of the first of the three classes, of which the illustration is <foreign lang="greek">τὸ ὑγιαίνειν</foreign>, the healthy state of body, active, actual health, as produced by <foreign lang="greek">ὑγιεία</foreign>, health in itself, we learn from two passages of the Nic. Eth. First, VI 13, 1144 <hi rend="italic">a</hi> 4, <foreign lang="greek">ἔπειτα καὶ ποιοῦσι μὲν</foreign> (<foreign lang="greek">αὗται αἱ ἀρεταὶ</foreign>) <foreign lang="greek">οὐχ ὡς ἰατρικὴ ὑγίειαν, ἀλλ’  ὡς ἡ ὑγίεια, οὕτως ἡ σοφία εὐδαιμονίαν· μέρος γὰρ οὖσα τῆς ὅλης ἀρετῆς τῷ ἔχεσθαι ποιεῖ καὶ τῷ ἐνεργεῖν εὐδαίμονα</foreign>. Here <foreign lang="greek">ὑγίεια</foreign> itself represents the formal cause of health, which is internal and essential (<foreign lang="greek">μέρος, ἔχεσθαι</foreign>), and developes, quickens, and stimulates the bodily functions into healthy activity, gives health an active reality (<foreign lang="greek">ἐνεργεῖ</foreign>), and is therefore contrasted with the efficient, and <hi rend="italic">external</hi> cause, the physician, who, as the Paraphrast on the parallel passage, X 4, says, <foreign lang="greek">συντηρεῖ καὶ φυλάττει, καὶ ὅπως παραμείνῃ ζητεῖ</foreign>. The second passage, X 4, 1174 <hi rend="italic">b</hi> 25, is again an illustration: <foreign lang="greek">οὐ τὸν αὐτὸν δὲ τόπον ἥ τε ἡδονὴ τελειοῖ καὶ τὸ αἰσθητόν τε καὶ ἡ αἴσθησις, σπουδαῖα ὄντα, ὥσπερ οὐδ’  ἡ ὑγίεια καὶ ὁ ἰατρὸς ὁμοίως αἴτιά ἐστι τοῦ ὑγιαίνειν</foreign>: on which the Paraphrast's (Andronicus Rhodius) commentary is, <foreign lang="greek">ἡ μὲν γὰρ αὐτὴ ποιεῖ μὴ οὖσα</foreign> (i. e. <foreign lang="greek">ἐνέργεια</foreign>, not &lsquo;non-existent&rsquo;) <foreign lang="greek">τὴν τοῦ ὑγιαίνειν ἐνέργειαν, ὁ δὲ συντηρεῖ κ.τ.λ.</foreign> as before. The second and third divisions represent two kinds of extraneous causes or conditions, distinguished from this formal, intrinsic cause. These are first, necessary conditions, as of health, represented by food; and secondly, probable conditions, as exercise, which, as Aristotle adds, only produces health <foreign lang="greek">ἐπὶ τὸ πολύ</foreign>. </p>

See the commencement of the Nic. Eth., and what is there said about these two <foreign lang="greek">τέλη</foreign>. Ethics and Rhetoric are <foreign lang="greek">πρακτικαὶ τέχναι</foreign>, the arts of the painter and statuary <foreign lang="greek">ποιητικαί</foreign>. Compare Introd. pp. 16&mdash;19. By the distinction here taken we find brought into view the specially &lsquo;practical&rsquo; character of the virtues, which, like the art that describes them, end in action: though besides this, <hi rend="italic">some</hi> of the virtues, at any rate, produce lasting effect, and leave results beyond the mere performance of the act, some <hi rend="italic">positive benefit</hi> (as an <foreign lang="greek">ἔργον</foreign>) to an individual or the community.

Of the two, <foreign lang="greek">ποιητικός</foreign> is most frequently used in the expression of this conception, as may be seen in the following sections. </p>
						<p>All moral virtues must necessarily be each a form of good: for they produce a good moral habit, or condition, or constitution in those that possess them, and are besides productive (and effective) of good in their actions and the results of these. </p>

This is done in c. 9. The contents of the chapter to which reference is here made shew that <foreign lang="greek">ἀρεταί</foreign> are here confined to the <foreign lang="greek">ἠθικαί</foreign> or moral virtues, the &lsquo;virtues&rsquo; <hi rend="italic">par excellence</hi>, and do not include physical, or any other, &lsquo;excellences&rsquo;. </p>

						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">καὶ τὴν ἡδονὴν ἀγαθὸν εἶναι</lemma>] What is here taken for granted, as universally admitted, that pleasure is good (though not necessarily <hi rend="italic">the</hi> good) is in both the treatises on pleasure, in the 6th and 10th books of the Nicomachean Ethics, carefully investigated and discussed, and the opinions held upon the question by preceding philosophers, as Eudoxus <pb n="102"/> and Plato, examined, Bk. VII, c. 12, seq. and X, c. 2. Aristotle's conclusion (in Bk. X) is that though pleasure may be regarded as good it is not <hi rend="italic">the</hi> good, i.e. the supreme good, good in itself, because there are <hi rend="italic">some</hi> pleasures which are not proper objects of choice and therefore not good. Eudemus (if the seventh book be his), seems rather to be inclined to the contrary view; it is said at any rate, c. 14, init., <foreign lang="greek">ἀνάγκη οὖν τὴν ἡδονὴν ἀγαθόν τι εἶναι</foreign>, and three lines further, <foreign lang="greek">ἄριστον τ’  οὐδὲν κωλύει ἡδονήν τινα εἶναι</foreign>. And at the beginning of c. 13, in answer to Plato's objection in the Philebus, we find, <foreign lang="greek">ὅτι δ’  οὐ συμβαίνει διὰ ταῦτα μὴ εἶναι ἀγαθὸν μηδὲ τὸ ἄριστον, ἐκ τῶνδε δῆλον</foreign>. This difference of view between the master and pupil (on the supposition that eudemus is the author of Bk. VII) is in fact in exact conformity with the difference of their respective definitions of pleasure; Aristotle defining it as the perfecting (<foreign lang="greek">τελείωσις</foreign>) of the <foreign lang="greek">ἐνέργεια</foreign>, but not our <foreign lang="greek">ἐνέργεια</foreign> itself, and therefore not &lsquo;the supreme good&rsquo;; whilst Eudemus goes further and describes it as an &lsquo;unimpeded energy&rsquo;, <foreign lang="greek">ἀνεμπόδιστος ἐνέργεια</foreign>: and in fact this variation may be regarded as one of the principal arguments for the difference of authorship of the two treatises on pleasure in the Nic. Eth. The principle upon which the fact is here assumed in the Rhetoric, is stated in both treatises of the Ethics; the universal recognition, namely, of the principle that pleasure is desirable. See VII 14 init. and X 2, 1172 <hi rend="italic">b</hi> 35, <foreign lang="greek">οἱ δ’  ἐνιστάμενοι ὡς οὐκ ἀγαθὸν οὗ πάντ̓ ἐφίεται, μὴ οὐθὲν λέγωσιν· ὃ γὰρ πᾶσι δοκεῖ, τοῦτ̓ εἶναι φαμέν</foreign>. </p>

It is defined in this latter sense, c. 9, 3, <foreign lang="greek">ὃ ἂν δἰ αὑτὸ αἱρετὸν ὂν ἐπαινετὸν ᾖ</foreign>, (its being the object of &lsquo;praise&rsquo; confers upon it its <hi rend="italic">moral</hi> character) <foreign lang="greek">ἢ ὃ ἂν ἀγαθὸν ὂν ἡδὺ ᾖ, ὅτι ἀγαθόν</foreign>.

Phaed. 85 A) is <hi rend="italic">to break a lyre</hi>, it is equally applicable to a pitcher. But when we try to render &lsquo;to drop&rsquo; by a word <hi rend="italic">exactly corresponding</hi> (<foreign lang="greek">ἀντίστροφος</foreign> in its primary sense), the language seems to fail us. I examined all the analogous Greek words (that I could think of), <foreign lang="greek">βάλλειν, ῥίπτειν, ἐᾶν</foreign> (&lsquo;to let go&rsquo;, but intentionally), <foreign lang="greek">χεῖν</foreign>, and a dozen others, with their compounds, and found them all infected with the same vice, in respect of the representation of the word &lsquo;to drop&rsquo;, viz. that they all express a voluntary and conscious action, whereas <hi rend="italic">drop</hi> is applied to an accidental and unintentional relaxation of the muscles, which cannot properly be called an <hi rend="italic">action</hi> at all. The notion may no doubt be expressed by a circumlocution, of which the Homeric <foreign lang="greek">ἔκπεσε</foreign>, or <foreign lang="greek">ἔκφυγε, χειρός</foreign> (said however of the <hi rend="italic">object</hi>, not the <hi rend="italic">subject</hi>), comp.

But these are not single words. And I am brought to the conclusion that the Greek language <hi rend="italic">has</hi> no single word to express the notion exactly; which is the less surprising, inasmuch as the French language labours under the same deficiency; the periphrasis <hi rend="italic">laisser tomber</hi> being made to supply the place of &lsquo;to drop&rsquo;. <foreign lang="greek">ἐκχεῖν</foreign>, Soph. Phil. 13, might seem to come nearest to the literal representation of it, were it not for Arist. Ran. 855, where the word undoubtedly expresses a conscious and intentional act. <foreign lang="greek">ὁ λόγος...ἐκπεσὼν οἰχήσεται</foreign>, Plat. Phileb. 13 B.</note> or break the pitcher at the door&rsquo;, after you have carried it home from the distant well with much toil and trouble, expresses the general conception of &lsquo;lost labour&rsquo;, &lsquo;labour thrown away&rsquo;. Erasmus, <hi rend="italic">Adagia</hi>, p. 350, <hi rend="italic">in foribus urceum</hi>, misinterprets the proverb as expressing something vile and contemptible, not worth the trouble of taking up. </p>
						<p>Another more common corresponding proverb is <foreign lang="greek">πλύνειν πλίνθον</foreign>, <hi rend="italic">laterem lavare</hi> (Terent. Phorm. I 4, 9) &lsquo;to try to make a red brick white <pb n="111"/> by washing it&rsquo;. Theocr. Id. XVI 62, <foreign lang="greek">ἢ ὕδατι νίζειν θολερὰν ἰοειδέϊ πλίνθον</foreign><note anchored="yes"><foreign lang="greek">θολερὰν πλίνθον</foreign> is to be interpreted here not of the colour of the brick, but of an unbaked brick dried in the sun, which melts away and turns to mud when it is washed.</note>, and answering to our &lsquo;washing a blackamoor white&rsquo;. Compare also Eur. Iph. Taur. 116, <foreign lang="greek">οὔτοι μακρὸν μὲν ἤλθομεν κώπῃ πόρον, ἐκ τερμάτων δὲ νόστον ἀροῦμεν πάλιν</foreign>. </p>
						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">περιμάχητον φαινόμενον</lemma>] &lsquo;apparently, manifestly, conspicuously (with <foreign lang="greek">φαίνεσθαι</foreign> in this sense, comp. II 2, 1, <hi rend="italic">bis</hi>) an object of contention&rsquo;. </p>
						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">τοῦτ’  ἀγαθὸν ἦν</lemma>] &lsquo;this is, as was said&rsquo;, i. e. in &sect; 2. This use of the imperfect, referring to a past transaction or statement referred to in present time, is so common both in Plato and Aristotle as to require no illustration. </p>
						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">οἱ δὲ πολλοὶ...φαίνονται</lemma>] The acts and opinions of the great body of people, the most of those that you know or have heard of, are as convincing to the popular audience to which Rhetoric is addressed, as those of all mankind if they could be ascertained. The fact therefore that the possession of anything is much contested and coveted, implying that a great many people seek after it and care for it, is as sufficient a proof <hi rend="italic">to them</hi> that it is a good, as if it could be shewn, as it ought by the rules, &sect; 2, that it is the <hi rend="italic">universal</hi> object of human aims: the sanction of &lsquo;the many&rsquo; is as good as an universal admission. </p>

						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">τὸ ἐπαινετόν</lemma>] The proper object of <foreign lang="greek">ἔπαινος</foreign> is virtue, any kind of <hi rend="italic">practical</hi> excellence; <foreign lang="greek">ἔστι δ’  ἔπαινος λόγος ἐμφανίζων μέγεθος ἀρετῆς</foreign>, Rhet. I 9, 33. On <foreign lang="greek">ἔπαινος</foreign> as the test of virtue and the distinction of this from <foreign lang="greek">ἐγκώμιον</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">εὐδαιμονισμός</foreign>, see Introd. Appendix B to Bk. I ch. 9, p. 212 seq. It is there said that <foreign lang="greek">ἔπαινος</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">ψόγος</foreign> are the equivalents of Butler's &lsquo;moral approbation and disapprobation&rsquo;. This requires some qualification. When the &lsquo;intellectual&rsquo; virtues are included as the objects of <foreign lang="greek">ἔπαινος</foreign>, as they certainly are in the Eth. Eud. II 1. 18, the approbation loses its exclusively moral character. In Eth. Nic. I 12, Aristotle together with the moral virtues, justice, courage, &lsquo;goodness&rsquo; in general, includes also as objects of praise all kinds of <foreign lang="greek">ἀρετή</foreign> or excellence, such as strength and swiftness, which are manifested in <hi rend="italic">action.</hi> </p>
						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">καὶ ὃ οἱ ἐχθροὶ καὶ οἱ φαῦλοι ἐπαινοῦσιν</lemma>] Victorius, in illustration of the former of these two topics, quotes Virg. Aen. XI 282, <hi rend="italic">Stetimus tela aspera contra, Contulimusque manus; experto credite quantus In clypeum assurgat, quo turbine torqueat hastam.</hi> The prowess of Aeneas could not be more highly extolled than by the praises extorted from his enemy Diomede. </p>
						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">καὶ οἱ φαῦλοι</lemma>] is rejected as a subsequent insertion by Muretus, F. A. Wolf, Bekker, Brandis, and Spengel, because it is passed over unnoticed in the explanatory commentary that follows, <foreign lang="greek">ὥσπερ γὰρπεπονθότες</foreign>. <pb n="112"/> Vater alone defends it. The explanation of it is easy, and it is perfectly consistent with the context and with good sense. If the vilest and meanest, the &lsquo;worthless and contemptible&rsquo;, <foreign lang="greek">φαῦλοι</foreign>, who are <hi rend="italic">least</hi> likely to be sensible of merit in others, being almost devoid of right moral instinct, find themselves compelled to praise some signal act of valour, disinterestedness, or virtue&mdash;we are engaged here upon <hi rend="italic">actions&mdash;a fortiori</hi> it must meet with the approbation of better judges, and be emphatically good. If with this reasonable explanation we take into account Aristotle's hasty and careless habit, twice already noticed, of interrupting an explanation or an argument by the insertion of something bearing indirectly on the subject, but not immediately appropriate, I think we may without scruple retain the words objected to. </p>
						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ὥσπερ γὰρ πάντες ἤδη ὁμολογοῦσιν</lemma>] &lsquo;for this is <hi rend="italic">now</hi> as good as, equivalent to, an universal admission&rsquo;. <foreign lang="greek">ἤδη</foreign>, &lsquo;by this time&rsquo;, now that we have got as far as this, have reached, that is, the level of enemies, the extreme case of those who are interested in denying the merit&mdash;if <hi rend="italic">they</hi> approve, all others must necessarily do so. </p>
						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">διὰ γὰρ τὸ φανερὸν...τὸ Ἴλιον</lemma>] There is a difficulty here which has much occupied the commentators, arising from the want of connexion, as the present text stands, between the two rules laid down, <foreign lang="greek">ὥσπερ καὶ... ἐπαινοῦσιν</foreign>, and the example (from Simonides) which is <hi rend="italic">said</hi>, <foreign lang="greek">διό</foreign>, to follow from them: the example, according to the present reading, is <hi rend="italic">not</hi> an inference from either of them. The best way of meeting the difficulty seems to be to adopt, with Spengel, the reading of the best MS A^{c}. This omits the words <foreign lang="greek">οὓς οἱ φίλοι ψέγουσι καὶ ἀγαθοί</foreign>, without which the sense is clear and consistent. &lsquo;For it must be owing to its being <hi rend="italic">evident</hi> that they are inclined to (would) admit it, just as&rsquo; (it is equally evident that, by the same rule, in the opposite case) &lsquo;those who are praised by their enemies must be worthless&rsquo;, (because if your enemy approves of your conduct towards him, which is assumed to be hostile, it shews that you can have done him no harm: and therefore that you have been wanting either in courage or patriotism or energy and skill). Of this the example of the Corinthians is now a real instance, and their suspicion of Simonides' intentions may be traced to the general rule. &lsquo;And this was why the Corinthians conceived the suspicion that they had been insulted by Simonides, when he wrote, &lsquo;Ilium has no fault to find with the Corinthians&rsquo; (which it ought to have had if they had done their duty). The Corinthians misinterpreted Simonides&rsquo; expressions; his intentions were innocent, but he failed to perceive the inference that might be derived from them. The line of Simonides is apparently misquoted by a lapse of memory. The Schol. Pind. Ol. XIII p. 78, who cites it, has <foreign lang="greek">μανίει</foreign> (<foreign lang="greek">ι^</foreign>) for <foreign lang="greek">μέμφεται</foreign>; and this reading appears also in another reference to it in Plut. Vit. Dion. c. I sub init. (cf. Bergk and Gaisf.), <foreign lang="greek">ὁ Σιμωνίδης φησὶ τοῖς Κορινθίοις οὐ μηνίειν τὸ Ἴλιον ἐπιστρατεύσασι μετὰ τῶν Ἀχαιῶν, ὅτι κἀκείνοις οἱ περὶ Γλαῦκον ἐξ ἀρχῆς Κορίνθιοι γεγονότες συνεμάχουν προθύμως</foreign>. Homer only says, Il. Z 152 seq., that Glaucus himself attributed his origin to <pb n="113"/> Sisyphus of Ephyre or Corinth. If this be the true explanation of the reason why Ilium was &lsquo;not wroth&rsquo;, or &lsquo;found no fault&rsquo;, with the Corinthians, and Aristotle remembered it when he used the example, it seems that the instance is very ill chosen for the purpose of illustrating the rule. In this case nothing is imputed to the Corinthians except that the aid of Glaucus and his men of Corinthian race compensated the Trojans for their own hostility, and therefore that Troy had nothing to reproach them with, which could scarcely be construed by them as an <hi rend="italic">insult:</hi> and the example only applies to the rule which it is supposed to exemplify in this sense; that the Trojans ought by the rule to have been represented as having directly censured the Corinthians, if Simonides had intended to pay them a compliment; by the mere omission of this they thought that he had insulted them. </p>

						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">τὰ προαιρετά</lemma>] &lsquo;objects of deliberate and voluntary choice&rsquo;. The <foreign lang="greek">προαίρεσις</foreign> seems here intended in the more general sense in which <foreign lang="greek">προαιρεῖσθαι</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">προαίρεσις</foreign> are employed in the ordinary language, and even sometimes in the Ethical treatise itself, as I 2, init. <foreign lang="greek">ἐπειδὴ πᾶσα γνῶσις καὶ προαίρεσις ἀγαθοῦ τινὸς ὀρέγεται. προαίρεσις</foreign> is defined in Eth. Nic.

And again in precise conformity with this, de Mot. Anim. c. 6, <foreign lang="greek">ἡ προαίρεσις κοινὸν διανοίας καὶ ὀρέξεως, ὥστε κινεῖ πρῶτον</foreign> (is the ultimate mover, the origin of motion or action) <foreign lang="greek">τὸ ὀρεκτὸν καὶ τὸ διανοητόν</foreign>, (it is the <hi rend="italic">object</hi> of the two faculties, and not the faculties themselves, which is the real origin of motion, according to the Aristotelian doctrine that the primary moving agent must be itself unmoved,) <foreign lang="greek">οὐ πᾶν δὲ τὸ διανοητὸν ἀλλὰ τὸ τῶν πρακτῶν τέλος</foreign>. Thus the <foreign lang="greek">προαίρεσις</foreign> is composed of two separate elements or faculties, intellectual and impulsive, of which the latter alone is the agent of motion, or stimulates to action: the intellectual part deliberates prior to action, and decides whether the proposed object of the action is good or bad, right or wrong<note anchored="yes">Accordingly, Metaph. <foreign lang="greek">Θ</foreign> 5, 1048 <hi rend="italic">a</hi> 11, <foreign lang="greek">ὄρεξις</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">προαίρεσις</foreign> are distinguished; <foreign lang="greek">ὄρεξις</foreign> is the general and spontaneous impulse to action, which when controlled and determined by the intellectual principle, <foreign lang="greek">διάνοια</foreign>, becomes the compound <foreign lang="greek">προαίρεσις</foreign>, the deliberate moral purpose.</note>. Though the <foreign lang="greek">προαίρεσις</foreign> in its general and wider signification of &lsquo;deliberate, voluntary purpose&rsquo; is capable of prompting to action of every kind, yet in its narrower and specially ethical usage it is <hi rend="italic">moral</hi> action alone that it originates and determines, <foreign lang="greek">οἰκειότατον γὰρ εἶναι δοκεῖ τῇ ἀρετῇ καὶ μᾶλλον τὰ ἤθη κρίνειν τῶν πράξεων</foreign>, Eth.

						<p>The Syntax of the phrase, which only Trendelenburg, as far as I know, has attempted to explain<note anchored="yes">Trendel. in <hi rend="italic">Rhein. Mus.</hi> 1828, Vol. II p. 481&mdash;3. The author, who has discussed with great learning and ingenuity the meaning of this Aristotelian technicality, and its relation to <foreign lang="greek">τὸ τί ἦν εἶναι</foreign>, is, it seems to me, less successful in his grammatical explanation. I think that from the analogy of similar constructions of this dative in the ordinary language, the use of it here must needs be a case of <hi rend="italic">attraction</hi>, as I have explained it in the note. Trendelenburg, who takes nothing into account but the possible meanings of the dative (or, as he rightly prefers to call it, the &lsquo;acceptive&rsquo;) case, locative, instrumental, acceptive, selects the last of the three as that which belongs to the dative in this phrase. <foreign lang="greek">τὸ μεγέθει εἶναι</foreign> express, according to him, &lsquo;the abstract conception (<foreign lang="greek">τὸ εἶναι</foreign>) belonging to (given to and received by) magnitude&rsquo;: making this dative depend solely upon <foreign lang="greek">εἰναι</foreign>, and leaving out the attraction to a word in the dative, actually or hypothetically preceding, as in any way concerned in the &lsquo;government&rsquo; of it. This is all that I have to object to in Trendelenburg's paper: in the rest he has shewn the same ability and intimate knowledge of his author which characterizes all his other writings upon Aristotle.</note>, seems to be this:&mdash;The dative is in apposition with a supposed <foreign lang="greek">τινί, τό τινι εἶναι μεγόθει</foreign>, and the construction is analogous to <foreign lang="greek">ὥστε συλλαβόντι εἰπεῖν</foreign>, I 10, 18. Other instances of a similar use of the dative, which lead up to the explanation of this, are such as Thuc. I 24, <foreign lang="greek">ἐν δεξίᾳ ἐσπλέοντι τὸν Ἰόνιον κόλπον</foreign>: and others are to be found in Matth. <hi rend="italic">Gr. Gr.</hi> &sect; 388. </p>

						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ἀρχή</lemma>] in this topic, is used in its most general and popular sense, an &lsquo;origin&rsquo;, or &lsquo;beginning&rsquo;, or &lsquo;source&rsquo;. In this sense it may be regarded as the fountain of all good. <foreign lang="greek">ἔοικε δ’  οὕτως ἔχειν</foreign> (<foreign lang="greek">ἡ εὐδαιμονία</foreign>) <foreign lang="greek">καὶ διὰ τὸ εἶναι ἀρχή· ταύτης γὰρ χάριν τὰ λοιπὰ πάντα πάντες πράττομεν, τὴν ἀρχὴν δὲ καὶ τὸ αἴτιον τῶν ἀγαθῶν τίμιόν τι καὶ θεῖον ἐτίθεμεν</foreign> (Eth.

The free will, one of the <foreign lang="greek">ὀρέξεις</foreign> or impulsive faculties, the origin of motion in the human subject, and of moral action, the <foreign lang="greek">ἀρχὴ πράξεως</foreign>, is an <foreign lang="greek">ἀρχή</foreign>: the importance of this, as the origin of human action and the ground of moral responsibility, in moral philosophy and practical life, may be estimated by the perusal of the first seven chapters of the third book of the Nicom. Ethics. It is more comprehensive than <foreign lang="greek">αἴτιον; ἀρχαί</foreign> are not <hi rend="italic">all</hi> causes, (see in the following note), and therefore the two may be distinguished, as they are in these two topics. An origin or beginning necessarily implies that something follows, a consequence; it leads to something: in this respect it is &lsquo;greater&rsquo;, more important, superior to, anything that is <hi rend="italic">not</hi> a beginning or origin, which leads to nothing. Plat. Rep. II 377 A, <foreign lang="greek">οὐκοῦν οἶσθ̓ ὅτι ἀρχὴ παντὸς ἔργου μέγιστον; μεγάλην γὰρ εχουσιν</foreign> (<foreign lang="greek">αἱ ἀρχαὶ</foreign>) <foreign lang="greek">ῥοπὴν πρὸς τὰ ἑπόμενα</foreign>, Eth. Nic. I 7, sub fin. And the same applies to <foreign lang="greek">αἴτιον</foreign> in the following topic. These two topics are well illustrated in Rhet. ad Alex. c. 3 (4), 10, 11. </p>
						<p>The importance of an <foreign lang="greek">ἀρχή</foreign> for good or for evil is recognized by several proverbs. On the one side we have <foreign lang="greek">ἀρχὴ ἥμισυ παντός</foreign>, (quoted in Demetr. <foreign lang="greek">περὶ ἑρμηνείας</foreign> &sect; 122, <foreign lang="greek">ἀρχὴ δέ τοι ἥμισυ παντός</foreign>,) Arist.

Ep. I 2, 40. The first step: <hi rend="italic">Ce n'est que le premier pas qui coute</hi>, see Rhet. II 19, 5, and note. On the other side, the importance of the <foreign lang="greek">ἀρχή</foreign> in respect of the tendency to evil, we have Ovid's well-known line, become proverbial, Rem. Am. 91, <hi rend="italic">Principiis obsta, sero medicina paratur.</hi> Fast. I 178, <hi rend="italic">Omina principiis, inquit</hi> (Phoebus), <hi rend="italic">inesse solent.</hi> (This is indifferent as to the issue.) Herodotus, after mention of the twenty ships which the Athenians on the solicitation of Aristagoras sent in aid of the Ionians, concludes the chapter, V 97, with the emphatic words, <foreign lang="greek">αὗται δὲ αἱ νεές, ἀρχὴ κακῶν ἐγένοντο Ἕλλησί τε καὶ βαρβάροισι</foreign>. This phrase became proverbial, see Rhet. III 11, 7 <hi rend="italic">bis</hi>, and Isocr. Paneg. &sect; 119, there quoted. </p>
						<p>On the different senses of <foreign lang="greek">ἀρχή</foreign> in the Aristotelian philosophy consult Metaph <foreign lang="greek">Δ</foreign> I, where they are enumerated and distinguished; and Bonitz's <hi rend="italic">Commentary.</hi> They are thus summed up; <foreign lang="greek">πασῶν μὲν οὖν κοινὸν τῶν ἀρχῶν τὸ πρῶτον εἶναι ὅθεν ἢ εστιν ἢ γίγνεται ἢ γιγνώσκεται· τούτων δὲ αἱ μὲν</foreign> <pb n="127"/> <foreign lang="greek">ἐνυπάρχουσαί εἰσιν αἱ δὲ ἐκτός</foreign>, 1013 <hi rend="italic">a</hi> 17. <foreign lang="greek">Ἀρχαί</foreign> are &lsquo;origins&rsquo;, heads or starting-points, of a series, of three kinds; (1) of being, <foreign lang="greek">οὐσία</foreign><note anchored="yes">The <foreign lang="greek">ἀρχή</foreign> as essence, origin of being, <foreign lang="greek">οὐσία</foreign>, is the primal cause, <foreign lang="greek">τὸ τί ἧν εἶναι</foreign>.

I 7, 12. The six senses in which <foreign lang="greek">ἀρχή</foreign> may be employed are all reducible to these three. Of these some are inherent (as the <foreign lang="greek">στοιχεῖον</foreign>, the mathematical point, the origin of the line, or the starting-point of anything, that out of which it grows and is developed<note anchored="yes" n="2"><foreign lang="greek">στοιχεῖον</foreign> &ldquo;hoc loco eum (Aristotelem) non tam elementi naturam cogitasse, quam principem illam rei alicuius partem, in qua primum continetur et destinata est ipsa rei natura, ex exemplis allatis facile cognoscas.&rdquo; Bon. <hi rend="italic">Comm.</hi> p. 218.</note>; the keel of a vessel, the foundation of a house; in animals the heart or the brain, or any other part which has been assumed to be the original seat of life); some external, the origin of motion or change, (as father and mother, of child; abusive language<note anchored="yes" n="3">This is an <foreign lang="greek">ἀρχὴ κακῶν</foreign>.</note>, of a fight; or again the human will or deliberate purpose, and intellect, <foreign lang="greek">προαίρεσις</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">διάνοια</foreign><note anchored="yes" n="4"><foreign lang="greek">καὶ διὰ τοῦτο ἡ διάνοια κινεῖ, ὅτι ἀρχὴ αὐτῆς ἐστὶ τὸ ὀρεκτόν</foreign>. de Anima I 10, 433 <hi rend="italic">a</hi> 19.</note>, in the case of &lsquo;governments&rsquo; [<foreign lang="greek">ἀρχαί</foreign>] and arts, all of which set things in motion and produce change). The origin or starting-point of knowledge is illustrated by the <foreign lang="greek">ὑποθέσεις</foreign>, the assumed first principles of a demonstration, as the major premiss of a syllogism. Another &lsquo;external origin&rsquo; is the <foreign lang="greek">οὗ ἕνεκα</foreign>, or <foreign lang="greek">τέλος</foreign>, the final cause, <foreign lang="greek">πολλῶν γὰρ καὶ τοῦ γνῶναι καὶ τῆς κινήσεως ἀρχὴ τἀγαθὸν καὶ τὸ καλόν</foreign>, <hi rend="italic">a</hi> 21.

						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ἀρχή</lemma> is not identical with <foreign lang="greek">αἴτιον</foreign>, though, as all <foreign lang="greek">αἴτια</foreign> (all the four causes) are <foreign lang="greek">ἀρχαί</foreign>, the two terms are frequently identified (Bonitz, <hi rend="italic">Comm.</hi> p. 219; Waitz, <hi rend="italic">Org.</hi> p. 458): but the converse is not true; as is shewn by some of the examples given above: the assertion therefore that <foreign lang="greek">ἰσαχῶς</foreign> (<foreign lang="greek">ταῖς ἀρχαῖς</foreign>) <foreign lang="greek">καὶ τὰ αἴτια λέγεται· πάντα γὰρ τὰ αἴτια ἀρχαί</foreign> (<hi rend="italic">a</hi> 16) must be limited to what is <hi rend="italic">directly</hi> stated, the converse is not included.

The adviser of a scheme is therefore according to this view the &lsquo;cause&rsquo; of all that resulted from his advice, which is made to appear (<foreign lang="greek">δοκεῖ</foreign>) by the argument more important than the result or actual crime (which is not &lsquo;the beginning&rsquo;); and, secondly, the converse (<foreign lang="greek">ἀνάπαλιν</foreign>) is proved, that the crime, the &lsquo;end&rsquo; of the advice or deliberation, is the more important thing of the two, because it was for that, as a mean to attain that, that the whole scheme was undertaken. It appears from the expressions of this text that Callistratus devised the scheme and Chabrias carried it into execution. </p>
						<p>Leodamas of Acharnae was a famous orator, an earlier contemporary of Demosthenes and Aeschines. The latter mentions him, c.

He is mentioned again in II 23, 25 (comp. the note there); in Dem. adv. Lept. 501 and 502, who also speaks of him as a distinguished orator, where allusion is made to a certain proposition of his to cancel the &lsquo;grant&rsquo;, especially the <foreign lang="greek">ἀτέλεια</foreign>, made to Chabrias for his public services &mdash;<foreign lang="greek">οὗτος ἐγράψατο τὴν Χαβρίου δωρεάν</foreign><note anchored="yes">This cannot be the same accusation as that which Aristotle here refers to; <foreign lang="greek">ἐγράψατο δωρεάν</foreign> <hi rend="italic">and</hi> <foreign lang="greek">τὸν πράξαντα</foreign>, &lsquo;the man that carried into execution a nefarious scheme&rsquo;, are quite inapplicable to the <hi rend="italic">same</hi> offence. Again Demosthenes, c. Mid. 535, tells us that <hi rend="italic">Philostratus</hi> was the accuser of Chabrias, <foreign lang="greek">ὅτ’  ἐκρίνετο τὴν περὶ Ὠρωποῦ τὴν κρίσιν θανάτου</foreign>. Were there two accusers of Chabrias on his trial? Or two separate trials? (this seems improbable): or has Aristotle made a slip of memory in assigning the accusation of Chabrias to Leodamas? None of these suppositions is necessary to reconcile the, at first sight, conflicting statements. The accusation of Leodamas is directed against <hi rend="italic">both</hi> parties; he takes the case of Callistratus first, and then secondly (<foreign lang="greek">πάλιν δέ</foreign>) applies the converse of the argument which he had issued against the other to the offence of Chabrias. Philostratus, who took part in the same proceedings, was another and independent accuser. Mr Grote, p. 393, note 3, who does not refer to the passage of Aristotle, assigns the trial or trials of Callistratus and Chabrias to this period, 366 B. C., and the alleged misconduct about Oropus. The other speech of Leodamas against Chabrias, referred to by Dem. adv. Lept. l. c. was earlier, and had nothing to do with the affair of Oropus. [Arnold Schaefer, <hi rend="italic">Demosthenes und seine Zeit</hi> 1 p. 96. s.]</note>, a proposition which he failed to <pb n="129"/> carry; and in other places of Aeschines. See Sauppe, <hi rend="italic">Fragm. Or. Att.</hi> II 216; Fr. XVI, and p. 244; Fr. XXVI; Clinton, <hi rend="italic">F. H.</hi> Vol. II p. 111, sub an. 372, 3. </p>
						<p>Callistratus, son of Callicrates, of Aphidna, a distinguished Athenian orator and politician, of the earlier half of the 4th cent. B. C. His name first appears in history in the year 379 B. C. Aristotle refers to two speeches of his, Rhet. I 14. 1, and III 17. 14. Leodamas' accusation of him, here mentioned, seems to have been directed against his conduct in the affairs of Oropus, in 366, Grote, <hi rend="italic">Hist. Gr.</hi> X p. 392; Smith's <hi rend="italic">Dict. Biogr.</hi> Art. Callistratus; Clinton, <hi rend="italic">Fast. Hell.</hi> II 396, note <hi rend="italic">w.</hi> He was associated with Chabrias, the celebrated Athenian general, in the transactions with respect to Oropus, and with him was brought to trial; and it is most probable that both of the speeches referred to in the text were made by Leodamas on this occasion. </p>
						<p>On Callistratus and Chabrias Mr Elder's articles in Smith's <hi rend="italic">Biogr. Dict.</hi> may be consulted. Callistratus' name occurs very frequently in the Attic orators. See Baiter and Sauppe, <hi rend="italic">Orat. Att.</hi> Vol. III; Ind. Nom. p. 73. </p>
						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">βουλεύσαντα, βουλευσαμένου, βουλεύσαντος, ἐπιβουλεύειν</lemma>] are all applied to the same transaction, viz. Callistratus' &lsquo;advice&rsquo; or &lsquo;device&rsquo;. They express precisely the same thing, each from a somewhat different point of view. <foreign lang="greek">βουλεύειν τινί τι</foreign>, is to give advice, to advise. <foreign lang="greek">βουλεύεσθαι</foreign> to give <hi rend="italic">oneself</hi> advice, to deliberate; or secondly, of a number of people deliberating together, and giving one another advice, &lsquo;consulting in common&rsquo;. So <foreign lang="greek">μὴ βουλευσαμένου</foreign> here is, &lsquo;if he had not deliberated upon it&rsquo; <pb n="130"/> preparatory to &lsquo;suggesting&rsquo; or &lsquo;advising&rsquo; it. <foreign lang="greek">ἐπιβουλεύειν</foreign> retains its proper sense of a <hi rend="italic">hostile</hi> design (<foreign lang="greek">ἐπί</foreign> &lsquo;against&rsquo;); the advice, or scheme which resulted from it, and the deliberation which suggested it, are now represented as &lsquo;a plot&rsquo;, a hostile, aggressive, design. It appears therefore that there is no occasion to have recourse to the explanation of Victorius and Buhle, that <foreign lang="greek">ἐπιβουλεύειν</foreign> is (or can be) put for <foreign lang="greek">βουλεύειν</foreign> or <foreign lang="greek">βουλεύεσθαι</foreign>. Gaisford prints these two notes of V. and B. without comment. </p>
						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">εἰ μὴ ἦν ὁ πράξων</lemma>] On this use of the definite article, indicating a member of a class or <foreign lang="greek">γένος</foreign>, which we express by our indefinite article, see Buttmann, <hi rend="italic">Gr. Gr.</hi> &sect; 124, Obs. 2. Engl. Tr. p. 319. The two senses of the Greek definite article are, according to Schneider, on Pl. Rep.

Herm. Praef. ad Iph. Aul. p. XV. Several examples of this usage of the def. art. are collected from the N. T. by Dean Alford, in a pamphlet in reply to Bishop Ellicott, p. 45 seq. I will only quote Matth. xiii. 3, <foreign lang="greek">ὁ σπείρων</foreign>: xxv. 32, <foreign lang="greek">ὁ ποιμήν</foreign>. In a subsequent passage of this work, II 4, 31, Aristotle has quite unconsciously and unintentionally stated this grammatical distinction, <foreign lang="greek">τὸ δὲ μῖσος καὶ πρὸς τὰ γένη· τὸν γὰρ κλέπτην μισεῖ κ.τ.λ.</foreign> </p>

						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">τὸ σπανιώτερον τοῦ ἀφθόνου</lemma>] &lsquo;The rarer, scarcer, is greater, more valuable or important, than the abundant&rsquo;. This, as is implied in <foreign lang="greek">ἀχρηστότερος ὤν</foreign> in the example, is only true <hi rend="italic">in a sense;</hi> it is in fact a paradox, which may however be asserted in argument, since there is something to be said for it, and examples may be found in which it is true; as in the case of gold and iron. In the true and proper sense, in utility and real value, iron is greater and better than gold. Isocrates, <foreign lang="greek">ἀντίδ</foreign>. &sect; 80, 81, on this ground of comparative rarity, <foreign lang="greek">ὅσῳ πέρ εἰσι σπανιώτεροι καὶ χαλεπώτεροι</foreign>, thinks that, in his time at least, great orators and politicians &lsquo;who can speak worthily on behalf of their country's interests&rsquo; are more valuable and to be more highly prized than legislators. A similar topic occurs in Top. <foreign lang="greek">Γ</foreign> 2, 117 <hi rend="italic">b</hi> 28, <foreign lang="greek">τὸ ἐπιφανέστερον τοῦ ἧττον τοιούτου, καὶ τὸ χαλεπώτερον· μᾶλλον γὰρ ἀγαπῶμεν ἔχοντες ἃ μὴ ἔστι ῥᾳδίως λαβεῖν. καὶ τὸ ἰδιαίτερον τοῦ κοινοτέρου</foreign>. </p>
						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ἄλλον δὲ τρόπον</lemma>] This gives the true side of the alternative, that the value of a thing is in proportion to its usefulness. Estimated by this standard, &lsquo;water&rsquo;, as Pindar says, at the opening of his first Olympian ode, &lsquo;is the best of all things.&rsquo; B&ouml;ckh, who cites this passage of Aristotle <pb n="131"/> in his note, evidently agrees with him in interpreting Pindar's <foreign lang="greek">ἄριστον</foreign> as &lsquo;best&rsquo; because most useful, or necessary to the support of human life<note anchored="yes">Pindar's own view of the meaning may be readily seen by comparing the first three lines of the 10th Olympian Ode: note the word <foreign lang="greek">χρῆσις</foreign>. In a speech, quoted by Spedding (<hi rend="italic">Letters and life of Fr. Bacon</hi>, Vol. III. p. 18), Bacon says: I liken this bill to that sentence of the poet (Pindar), who sets this as a paradox in the fore-front of his book, <hi rend="italic">first water, then gold</hi>, preferring necessity before pleasure; and I am of opinion, that things necessary in use are better than those things that are glorious in estimation.</note>. Dissen thinks that Pindar had in his mind the great &lsquo;wholesomeness&rsquo; of water, <foreign lang="greek">ἄριστον</foreign> <hi rend="italic">dicitur</hi> <foreign lang="greek">τὸ ὕδωρ</foreign> <hi rend="italic">quia saluberrimum est.</hi> A dry and hot climate and a parched soil would also readily suggest the notion that water is the best of all things. But I agree nevertheless with B&ouml;ckh in his interpretation of Pindar's thought. </p>
						<p>These two opposite topics represent two prevailing modes of estimating &lsquo;value&rsquo;, by <hi rend="italic">use</hi> and <hi rend="italic">price:</hi> Political Economy teaches us that the former is the true, the latter the false standard. In the one view air and water are the most valuable, in the other the least valuable, of all things. Plato, Euthyd. 304, 3, gives both sides: <foreign lang="greek">τὸ γὰρ σπάνιον, ὦ Εὐθύδημε, τίμιον· τὸ δὲ ὕδωρ εὐωνότατον, ἄριστον ὄν, ὡς ἔφη Πίνδαρος</foreign>. </p>

Moral considerations are altogether laid aside, and Rhetoric is here permitted (not recommended) to take the immoral side of the question: vice may be regarded as an &lsquo;end&rsquo; of human desire and exertion. </p>
						<p>Bonitz, <hi rend="italic">Arist. Stud.</hi> I. p. 87, proposes an ingenious alteration, which no one who is satisfied with the preceding explanation will consider necessary. It is to substitute for the existing text, <foreign lang="greek">καὶ ἀρετὴ μὴ κακίας καὶ κακία μὴ ἀρετῆς μείζων</foreign>, &lsquo;positive, downright, virtue is greater (better <hi rend="italic">or</hi> worse) than mere absence of vice, and downright vice than mere absence of virtue&rsquo;: which he neither translates nor explains; but, it is to be presumed, it means that the superiority of the one to the other still rests upon its <hi rend="italic">positive</hi> character. The <hi rend="italic">morality</hi> remains constant; for vice is still represented as the object of men's aims: it is therefore no improvement in that respect. His reason for the change is, &lsquo;that it never could occur to any one to institute a comparison in respect of magnitude (<hi rend="italic">Gr&ouml;sse</hi>) between <foreign lang="greek">ἀρετή</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">μὴ ἀρετή</foreign>, and <foreign lang="greek">κακία</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">μὴ κακία</foreign>.&rsquo; Not perhaps if <foreign lang="greek">μείζων</foreign> implied nothing but mere magnitude or quantity; but when it is extended to the general notion of superiority the comparison may very well be made between them. And besides, Bonitz's altered comparison appears to rest upon the very same distinction of the positive and negative; for in what other sense can vice be regarded as superior to nonvirtue? </p>

The higher and nobler choice is illustrated by the preference of being wronged to doing wrong. This, though cited here as a popular sentiment, was by no means the current and prevailing opinion at Athens. Plato, Rep. II 358 C, makes Glaucon say, speaking of the <hi rend="italic">opposite</hi> view, <foreign lang="greek">ἀκούων Θρασυμάχου καὶ μυρίων ἄλλων</foreign>: and again, at the commencement of Glaucon's exposition of the <hi rend="italic">dis</hi>advantages of justice and the superiority of injustice successful and unpunished, he uses the word <foreign lang="greek">φασί</foreign>, which seems to imply that this was the general opinion. In fact one of the main objects of the Republic is to prove that the reverse of this is true; and the long and laborious process which he is obliged to go through in the establishment of his position is quite sufficient to shew how strong must have been the prejudices in favour of the adverse doctrine which must be surmounted before he could hope to make his own views acceptable. The Gorgias also is occupied with the solution of this same question, in the comparison namely of doing and receiving injury and wrong, on <hi rend="italic">which</hi> side the advantage, when rightly estimated, really lies. The Sophists, as represented by Thrasymachus in the Republic, and Callias in the Gorgias, appear to have held the lower, and as we now hold it to be, immoral doctrine.

						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ὅσα εἶναι μᾶλλον κ.τ.λ.</lemma>] The difference between this and the preceding topic seems to lie in this.

The second is a special variety of the first, &lsquo;what men wish <hi rend="italic">to be</hi>&rsquo;<hi rend="italic">;</hi> the qualities, such as virtues, which they desire to possess, or seem to possess. Here again the reality is preferable to the mere credit and external appearance of the virtue. &lsquo;And, therefore, it is a vulgar and popular opinion (<foreign lang="greek">φασί</foreign>, Plat. Rep. II 358 A; and not merely the doctrine of the vulgar, <foreign lang="greek">οἱ πολλοί</foreign>, but maintained also by would-be philosophers, as Thrasymachus and Callicles) that justice is a thing of small value (mean and contemptible), because the appearance of it is preferable to the reality, whereas in the case of health it is the reverse&rsquo;. Victorius quotes, in exemplification of <foreign lang="greek">φασί</foreign>, two iambic lines from Plutarch de Aud.

In the second of these two cases, if the addition of a quantity to the less of two other quantities makes the sum total of the two greater than the sum total arising from the addition of another different quantity to the other, we may infer that the former of the two added quantities is greater than or preferable to the latter. 4 is less than 6: if the addition of 8 to 4 produces a total 12, which is greater than the total resulting from the addition of an unknown quantity <hi rend="italic">x</hi>, to 6, and therefore less than 12, we may infer (by calculation) that <hi rend="italic">x</hi> is less than 8. </p>

A similar omission occurs in Plat. Phaedr. 275 A, <foreign lang="greek">τοὐναντίον εἶπες ἢ δύναται</foreign>. Similar examples quoted from Plato by Stallbaum (note ad loc.) make it probable that the oversight is due to the author. &lsquo;Things that do shew themselves, and are conspicuous, have a greater air of reality about them than those that do not (that lurk out of sight), and may therefore lay claim to the preference&rsquo;. </p>
						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">διὸ τὸ πλουτεῖν φανείη ἂν μεῖζον ἀγαθὸν τοῦ δοκεῖν</lemma>] This, the vulgar reading, which Victorius found in all his MSS, is no inference or exemplification of the preceding rule, though it is supported by Schrader, who however does not explain the connexion. If it be applied to the rule, the show or appearance, <foreign lang="greek">τὸ δοκεῖν</foreign>, of wealth is said <foreign lang="greek">λανθάνειν</foreign>, <hi rend="italic">not</hi> to be seen; which is absurd. It <hi rend="italic">does</hi> follow from the topic in &sect; 37, and may possibly have been thence transferred to this place. Some MSS and the Greek Scholiast give <foreign lang="greek">πλουτεῖν...καὶ δοκεῖν</foreign>, but it seems unlikely that the two verbs, if the combination of the two was intended, should be so widely separated: also <foreign lang="greek">καὶ τὸ δοκεῖν</foreign> would be required. This was corrected by Muretus, <foreign lang="greek">τὸ πλουτεῖν καὶ δοκεῖν φανείη ἂν μεῖζον ἀγαθὸν τοῦ πλουτεῖν</foreign>, which seems rather too violent an alteration. Brandis would adopt the reading of his anonymous commentator, <foreign lang="greek">διὸ τὸ πλουτεῖν καὶ δοκεῖν φανείη ἂν μεῖζον ἀγαθὸν τοῦ μὴ δοκεῖν</foreign> (Schneidewin's <hi rend="italic">Philologus</hi> IV i p. 42), also conjectured by Vater, and confirmed by the Greek Schol., who explains it, <foreign lang="greek">καὶ τὸ πλουτεῖν καὶ φαίνεσθαι μεῖζον τοῦ πλουτεῖν καὶ μὴ φαίνεσθαι</foreign>. Another mode of correction had occurred to me, the interchange, viz. of <foreign lang="greek">τό</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">τοῦ, τοῦ πλουτεῖν...τὸ δοκεῖν</foreign>. The meaning of this would be, that the appearance or outward show of wealth, together with the wealth itself which it manifested, might upon this principle be made to appear superior to the wealth without the show, because the possessor would lose all the credit of it&mdash;but this involves perhaps rather a non-natural interpretation of <foreign lang="greek">πρὸς ἀλήθειαν τείνει</foreign>. I am indebted to Mr Munro for a suggestion that deserves attention: the substitution of <foreign lang="greek">τῷ</foreign>, for <foreign lang="greek">τοῦ, δοκεῖν</foreign>: the alteration is very slight, and gives an excellent sense; the value of wealth by this rule may be considered to be augmented by the addition of the prominent and conspicuous display of it. Bekker and Spengel retain the vulgate. </p>

It is similarly explained (in the supposed Homeric sense) by many of the Interpp. of Matth. iii. 17, Mark i. 11, Luc. iii. 22, and other places where Christ is called <foreign lang="greek">ὁ ἀγαπητὸς υἱὸς Θεοῦ</foreign>. Dr Lightfoot, in <hi rend="italic">Camb. Journ. of Classical and Sacred Philol.</hi> Vol. III. p. 92, No. 7, thinks that from the primary notion of <foreign lang="greek">ἀγαπᾶν</foreign> &lsquo;to welcome&rsquo;&mdash;which is undoubtedly its original and Homeric sense&mdash;it expresses rather the external act than the inward feeling, and should be translated in Homer rather by &lsquo;fondled or caressed&rsquo;, than &lsquo;beloved&rsquo;. Fritzsche, on Eth. Eud. III. 6, 1233 <hi rend="italic">b</hi> 2, renders <foreign lang="greek">τοῦ ἀγαπητοῦ</foreign>, <hi rend="italic">filii unice dilecti.</hi> See the references in his note.

Is it possible that the author of this treatise could use the one word for the other? On the other side it may be said that Aristotle is extremely hasty and careless in writing, and that the inconsistency is in this case justified and explained by his having for the nonce conformed to the ordinary usage of the language: and the evidence on either side seems so nicely balanced, manuscript authority included, that the question cannot be positively determined.

Pol. III 9, init. </p>
						<p>Democracy is a form of government that is distinguished from the rest, (is characterised), by the distribution of offices amongst the people <hi rend="italic">by themselves</hi> (<foreign lang="greek">διανέμονται</foreign>, mid.) and <hi rend="italic">by lot</hi>, each member of the entire body of citizens having an equal chance of obtaining them: this is equivalent to saying that the <foreign lang="greek">ὅρος</foreign> of a democracy, its determining principle, that which gives its special character is &lsquo;equality&rsquo;, <foreign lang="greek">ἰσότης</foreign>, which is the foundation of the <foreign lang="greek">ἐλευθερία</foreign> (usually assigned as its <foreign lang="greek">ὅρος</foreign>), and therefore its proper <foreign lang="greek">τέλος</foreign>. This is laid down in Pol. VI (IV) 4, 1291 <hi rend="italic">b</hi> 30 seq. &lsquo;Liberty&rsquo; and &lsquo;equality&rsquo; are the catchwords of a democracy. <foreign lang="greek">δύο γάρ ἐστιν οἷς ἡ δημοκρατία δοκεῖ ὡρίσθαι, τῷ τὸ πλεῖον εἶναι κύριον καὶ τῇ ἐλευθερίᾳ. τὸ μὲν γὰρ δίκαιον ἴσον δοκεῖ εἶναι, ἴσον δ’  ὅ τι ἂν δόξῃ τῷ πλήθει τοῦτ̓ εἶναι κύριον, ἐλεύθερον δὲ καὶ ἴσον τὸ ὅ τι ἂν βούληταί τις ποιεῖν</foreign> (Pol. VIII (V) 9, sub fin.). Liberty alone is not sufficient in the way of a distinction, (Ib. 1290 <hi rend="italic">b</hi> 7 seq.), though it is commonly assigned as such, Ib. c. 8, 1294 <hi rend="italic">a</hi> 10, <foreign lang="greek">ἀριστοκρατίας μὲν γὰρ ὅρος ἀρετή, ὀλιγαρχίαι δὲ πλοῦτος, δήμου δ’  ἐλευθερία</foreign>. Another current <foreign lang="greek">ὅρος</foreign> of democracy is the will of the majority: where that is sovereign the state is democratical. Ib. VII (VI) 3, 1318 <hi rend="italic">a</hi> 18, <foreign lang="greek">φασὶ γὰρ οἱ δημοτικοὶ τοῦτο δίκαιον ὅτι ἂν δόξῃ τοῖς πλείοσιν</foreign><note anchored="yes">This however is common to all three, democracy, oligarchy, aristocracy; in all of them alike, <foreign lang="greek">ὅτι ἂν δόξῃ τῷ πλείονι μέρει τῶν μετεχόντων τῆς πολιτείας, τοῦτ’  ἐστὶ κύριον</foreign>. Pol. VI (IV) 8, 1294 <hi rend="italic">a</hi> 13.</note>. But this again rests upon the notion of equality, because it implies that as all the citizens are individually equal, and have equal rights, the greater number has the higher right, and <hi rend="italic">therefore</hi> prevails over the minority. The theory of democracy is, that all citizens are equal; not that all men are born equal, because all barbarians are <hi rend="italic">naturally</hi> inferior to Greeks. The use of the &lsquo;lot&rsquo;, <pb n="154"/> which leaves the choice of the candidate to chance, is an exemplification of this, because it assumes the equality of the claims of all citizens to office. On the different kinds of democracy, see Pol. VI (IV) 4, 1291 <hi rend="italic">b</hi> 14 seq. </p>
						<p>The <foreign lang="greek">ὅρος</foreign> of <hi rend="italic">oligarchy</hi> is <foreign lang="greek">πλοῦτος</foreign>: and therefore property, a census, <foreign lang="greek">τίμημα</foreign> (estimated value of property), is necessary as a qualification for office, for that which confers authority or sovereignty, <foreign lang="greek">ἐν ᾗ οἱ ἀπὸ τιμημάτων</foreign> (<foreign lang="greek">διανέμονται τὰς ἀρχάς</foreign>, they likewise distribute amongst <hi rend="italic">themselves</hi>, keep to themselves, all offices of state, all the powers of government). Pol. VI (IV) 4, 1290 <hi rend="italic">b</hi> 1: the different kinds of oligarchy, Ibid. c. 5, the first is <foreign lang="greek">τὸ ἀπὸ τιμημάτων</foreign>.

A complete definition of <foreign lang="greek">δημοκρατία</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">ὀλιγαρχία</foreign> is given, VI (IV) 4, 1290 <hi rend="italic">b</hi> 17. In the popular Rhetoric <foreign lang="greek">οἱ ἀπὸ τιμημάτων</foreign> is the general designation of the privileged class: but in the exacter Politics VI (IV) 5, two kinds of <foreign lang="greek">τιμήματα</foreign> are distinguished which characterise two different kinds of oligarchies; one in which the property qualification is only so high as to exclude the poor, and acquired property procures admission into the privileged class: the other in which the qualification is high, and the governing class, which is therefore small, fill up themselves the vacancies as they occur. Again, <foreign lang="greek">ἀπὸ τιμημάτων</foreign> is too wide a term, and therefore not properly characteristic: it includes <hi rend="italic">more</hi> than oligarchies, one form of democracy, <foreign lang="greek">τὸ τὰς ἀρχὰς ἀπὸ τιμημάτων εἶναι, βραχέων δὲ τούτων ὄντων</foreign>, Pol.

						<p>The <foreign lang="greek">ὅρος</foreign> of <hi rend="italic">aristocracy</hi> is in the Politics <foreign lang="greek">ἀρετή</foreign> and not <foreign lang="greek">παιδεία</foreign>. The two following observations are added in the way of notes to explain the apparent discrepancy. &lsquo;Aristocracy is a kind of polity in which education is the qualification for a share in the government. By education, I mean that which is established by the law of the land: for it is those who have lived in constant obedience to the state institutions that bear rule in the aristocracy&rsquo;. The virtue of a citizen is not one and the same; it varies under different forms of government. The system of education must therefore be fixed and controlled by the government and conformed to its established institutions. This is the &lsquo;education established by the law&rsquo; of the text. On the absolute necessity of this kind of training in virtue under state direction for grown men as well as children, see Eth. N. X 10, 1179 <hi rend="italic">b</hi> 32 seq., and the unfinished treatise on education in Bk. V (VIII) of the Politics. &ldquo;Such men as these must necessarily appear &lsquo;best&rsquo;, and it is from them that this (form of constitution) has derived its name&rdquo;. Since <foreign lang="greek">παιδεία</foreign> therefore is the necessary preparation for <foreign lang="greek">ἀρετή</foreign>, either of them may be represented as the object of the state. Definitions of <foreign lang="greek">ἀριστοκρατία</foreign> are to be found, Pol. III 7, 1279 <hi rend="italic">a</hi> 34, where two explanations of the <foreign lang="greek">ἀριστο-</foreign> in the name are given: either <foreign lang="greek">διὰ τὸ τοὺς ἀρίστους ἄρχειν</foreign> (which is adopted here), or <foreign lang="greek">διὰ τὸ πρὸς τὸ ἄριστον τῇ πόλει καὶ τοῖς κοινωνοῦσιν αὐτῆς</foreign>: c. 15, 1286 <hi rend="italic">b</hi> 4, <foreign lang="greek">τῶν πλειόνων ἀρχὴν ἀγαθῶν δ’  ἀνδρῶν</foreign>, Ib.

But, c. 15, 1299 <hi rend="italic">b</hi> 25, <foreign lang="greek">ἐν ταῖς ἀριστοκρατίαις</foreign> (<foreign lang="greek">αἱ ἀρχαὶ</foreign>) <foreign lang="greek">ἐκ πεπαιδευμένων</foreign>. </p>
						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">μοναρχία</lemma>] the sole government of one, includes <foreign lang="greek">βασιλεία κατὰ τάξιν τινά</foreign>, a monarchy under certain fixed regulations or conditions, a limited, constitutional monarchy, <foreign lang="greek">ἐπὶ ῥητοῖς γέρασιν πατρικὴ βασιλεία</foreign>, Thuc. I 13, and the &lsquo;indefinite&rsquo;, unrestricted, unlimited tyranny. The distinction between the two here rests upon the limitation of the sovereign power or the absence of it. So in Pol. III 14, 1285 <hi rend="italic">a</hi> 27, <foreign lang="greek">οἱ μὲν γὰρ</foreign> (<foreign lang="greek">βασιλεῖς</foreign>) <foreign lang="greek">κατὰ νόμον καὶ ἑκόντων, οἱ δ’  ἀκόντων ἄρχουσιν</foreign>. The second of these two distinctions of the voluntary and involuntary obedience is repeated 1285 <hi rend="italic">b</hi> 2 (<foreign lang="greek">βασιλεῖαι</foreign>) <foreign lang="greek">διὰ μὲν τὸ τυραννικαὶ εἶναι δεσποτικαί, διὰ δὲ τὸ αἱρεταὶ καὶ ἑκόντων βασιλικαί</foreign>. &lsquo;Usurpation&rsquo;, as the distinctive difference of tyranny as opposed to monarchy (Eth. N. VIII 12), is insufficient. The government of the hereditary monarchs of Persia is &lsquo;tyrannous&rsquo; in respect of the nature and mode of exercise of their power, though these and other barbarian monarchies are <foreign lang="greek">κατὰ νόμον καὶ πατρικαί</foreign>, Pol. III 14, 1285 <hi rend="italic">a</hi> 18 and 22, <foreign lang="greek">ὁ μοχθηρὸς βασιλεὺς τύραννος γίνεται</foreign>, Eth. N. VIII 12. Lastly, the tyrant has a mercenary &lsquo;body-guard&rsquo;, <foreign lang="greek">φυλακή</foreign> (this is distinctive of &lsquo;tyranny&rsquo;; see Rhet. I 2. 19). The regular constitutional sovereign is protected, if at all, by a national guard of citizens, III 14, 1285 <hi rend="italic">a</hi> 24. But the true distinction between them is determined by the <hi rend="italic">end</hi> of the government of each: with the one it is his own interest, <foreign lang="greek">τὸ αὑτοῦ συμφέρον</foreign>: with the other it is the interest of the governed, <foreign lang="greek">πρὸς τὸ κοινὸν συμφέρον</foreign>, III 7, 1279 <hi rend="italic">a</hi> 27&mdash;31, VIII (V) 10, 1311 <hi rend="italic">a</hi> 2, <foreign lang="greek">ἡ δὲ τυραννὶς...πρὸς οὐδὲν ἀποβλέπει κοινόν, εἰ μὴ τῆς ἰδίας ὠφελείας χάριν. ἔστι δὲ σκοπὸς τυραννικὸς τὸ ἡδύ, βασιλικὸς δὲ τὸ καλόν</foreign>. </p>

						<p>The &lsquo;end&rsquo; of each form of government may be identified with its <foreign lang="greek">ὅρος</foreign>, because &lsquo;everything being <hi rend="italic">determined</hi> by its end&rsquo;, the end <hi rend="italic">does</hi> determine (<foreign lang="greek">ὁρίζεται</foreign>) or characterise the special form which each kind of government assumes. These <foreign lang="greek">ὅροι</foreign> or <foreign lang="greek">τέλη</foreign> have already been considered in the preceding note. All choice is directed to some end: the end of the state, or its governing and guiding principle, must control and give a direction to all the choice and the consequent action of its citizens; and hence the necessity that the statesman and public speaker should be acquainted with it. &lsquo;Plainly therefore it is with a view to the end of each form of government that our analysis of its habits, institutions, and interests should be conducted, because it is to this that the motives and actions of the body of men that we have to address are ultimately directed&rsquo;. <pb n="156"/> </p>
						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">τυραννίδος δὲ φυλακή] φυλακή</lemma> is here &lsquo;precaution&rsquo;, &lsquo;self-defence&rsquo;&mdash;a form of <hi rend="italic">self-interest.</hi> <foreign lang="greek">τὸ ἴδιον συμφέρον</foreign>, characteristic of &lsquo;tyranny&rsquo;&mdash;and hence, as a means to this end, the <foreign lang="greek">φυλακή</foreign> in its other sense, the mercenary body-guard, becomes a necessity, and distinctive of a tyranny. But as a <foreign lang="greek">φυλακή</foreign>, in some sense, is equally required by any sole ruler or monarch, who is always in danger from the attempts of rivals, or rebels, or revolutionists,&mdash;the sole ruler has only one life to lose, and hence the <hi rend="italic">personal</hi> danger; in governments of many, where the members are numerous, the attempt to get rid of them all would be difficult or impossible, and consequently it is not made&mdash;so here <foreign lang="greek">βασιλεία</foreign> or <foreign lang="greek">μοναρχία</foreign> is included under the general head of <foreign lang="greek">τυραννίς</foreign>: so Schrader. Failing to see this, some transcriber, whose reading appears in the Greek Scholiast<note anchored="yes">It is Brandis' &lsquo;Anonymus.&rsquo; See his paper in Schneidewin's <hi rend="italic">Philologus</hi>, IV i p. 43.</note>, had inserted the clause <foreign lang="greek">βασιλείας δὲ τὸ ἐννόμως ἐπιστατεῖν</foreign>, which being wanting in all the MSS, and not rendered by the Latin Translators, was deservedly rejected by Victorius. Vater, who does not agree with Victorius' and Schrader's view, thinks that some words descriptive of the <foreign lang="greek">τέλος</foreign> of the <foreign lang="greek">βασιλεία</foreign> have dropt out; and Spengel, by &lsquo;indicating a lacuna&rsquo; (<hi rend="italic">Rhet. Gr.</hi> Praef. VI), appears to be of the same opinion. </p>
						<p>Upon the whole I think that Brandis' view of the question is to be preferred (<hi rend="italic">Philologus</hi> IV i p. 43). It certainly is not likely, though possible, that Aristotle would have identified monarchy and tyranny, considering the treatment of them which he adopts in the Politics, and that he has already subdivided <foreign lang="greek">μοναρχία</foreign> into <foreign lang="greek">βασιλεία</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">τυραννίς</foreign> in &sect; 4. Consequently, it appears that this division was adhered to in &sect; 5, and something to represent the <foreign lang="greek">τέλος</foreign> of <foreign lang="greek">βασιλεία</foreign> has been lost. </p>

						<p>The subject of this chapter is the analysis of virtue and vice, the noble and disgraceful, moral right and wrong, as the objects of praise and blame, and therefore furnishing materials for the epideictic or encomiastic branch of Rhetoric, of which praise and blame are the characteristic functions. </p>
						<p>We may also derive from this analysis topics of the <foreign lang="greek">ἤθη</foreign>, characters or dispositions which serve to give the speech an ethical colour. This is to be effected by producing <hi rend="italic">by the speech</hi> (artistically, not by any evidence of character previously acquired, &lsquo;authority&rsquo;) the impression upon the audience of our truthfulness and probity; of our practical wisdom which will enable us to give them useful advice, and finally of our goodwill towards themselves; this being &lsquo;the second mode of persuading&rsquo; (<foreign lang="greek">ἦν</foreign> &lsquo;was said&rsquo;, cf. c. 2 &sect;&sect; 3, 4): because the same materials can be employed in representing ourselves as well as others as &lsquo;trustworthy in respect of virtue&rsquo;, as men of such a character as can be depended upon. </p>

						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ἀρετή</lemma>] The definition of virtue here given compared with the celebrated one of Eth. Nic. II 6, init., and the detailed treatment of the list of virtues and the meagre and incomplete account here given of them, contrasted with the elaborate and ingenious analysis of them in the third and fourth books of the same work, is a most striking illustration of the difference between the point of view and method of treatment in the popular Rhetoric and comparatively scientific Ethics. For example, the definition here given coincides in no single point with that of the Ethics. It regards virtue solely on the side of its usefulness, probably because this feature of it is likely to produce the greatest effect upon the popular mind. Instead of a <foreign lang="greek">ἕξις</foreign> it is a mere <foreign lang="greek">δύναμις</foreign>, an undeveloped faculty or power&mdash;this is most expressly denied in Eth. N. II 4, 1106 <hi rend="italic">a</hi> 5, <pb n="160"/> &mdash;the <foreign lang="greek">προαίρεσις</foreign>, the special moral element is omitted, as is also the doctrine of the mean in its application to virtue, and the standard by which this relative mean is to be determined. </p>
						<p>Regarded as a <foreign lang="greek">δύναμις</foreign>, virtue is a practical faculty, employed in &lsquo;providing and securing or keeping good things&rsquo;&mdash;for oneself, apparently, by the exercise of any <foreign lang="greek">ἀρετή</foreign>, excellence or accomplishment bodily or mental&mdash;and secondly, &lsquo;a power of conferring benefits, or doing services, many and great, in fact <hi rend="italic">all in everything</hi> (on all occasions)&rsquo;. <foreign lang="greek">πάντων περὶ πάντα</foreign> is doubtless, as Victorius intimates, a proverbial expression, more especially as it is found in a letter of Cicero to Cassius (ad Div. XV 17. 1, <hi rend="italic">sed expecta</hi> <foreign lang="greek">πάντα περὶ πάντων</foreign><note anchored="yes">Cicero has altered the form and the application of the proverb. In the text it means &lsquo;all kinds on all occasions&rsquo;, in Cicero it is &lsquo;all the news about everything&rsquo;.</note>).

VI. <foreign lang="greek">σοφία</foreign> is omitted in the detailed explanation of the virtues, most likely because it has very little in common with Rhetoric, and would be useless to the rhetorician. <foreign lang="greek">πραότης</foreign>, which in the Ethics is ranked, as well as here, amongst the virtues, which are there <foreign lang="greek">ἕξεις</foreign>, here <foreign lang="greek">δυνάμεις</foreign>, in the second book of the Rhetoric becomes a <foreign lang="greek">πάθος</foreign>, so that it belongs to all the three divisions of our moral nature distinguished in Eth.

The first of these is <hi rend="italic">political courage</hi>, the courage of a citizen, as a member of a state, and living under and directed by its laws, described in 1116 <hi rend="italic">a</hi> 17&mdash;<hi rend="italic">b</hi> 2. And this seems to be the view of courage which is taken here, the terms employed in each corresponding very closely, <foreign lang="greek">δοκοῦσι γὰρ ὑπομένειν τοὺς κινδύνους</foreign> (this restricts the virtue to facing <hi rend="italic">danger</hi> and gives it a narrower sense than &lsquo;fortitude&rsquo;) <foreign lang="greek">οἱ πολῖται διὰ τὰ ἐκ τῶν νόμων ἐπιτίμια καὶ τὰ ὀνείδη καὶ διὰ τὰς τιμάς</foreign>, <hi rend="italic">a</hi> 18. <foreign lang="greek">δἰ αἰδῶ</foreign> (it is due to a sense of honour) <foreign lang="greek">καὶ διὰ καλοῦ ὄρεξιν, τιμῆς γάρ, καὶ φυγὴν ὀνείδους, αἰσχροῦ ὄντος</foreign>, <hi rend="italic">a</hi> 28.

The prominence of the military character of this virtue is likewise marked in the description both of the Ethics and Rhetoric by <foreign lang="greek">ὑπομένειν τοὺς κινδύνους</foreign> in the one, and by <foreign lang="greek">ἔργων ἐν κινδύνοις</foreign> &sect; 8, and <foreign lang="greek">ἡ...ἐν πολέμῳ</foreign> &sect; 6, in the other; so that it seems that there is sufficient warrant for the identification of the two; the duty to the state and obedience to its laws being again made the ground of the obligation to practise this virtue. </p>

						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ἐλευθεριότης</lemma>] The principal difference between the views taken of the virtues in the Ethics and Rhetoric respectively, is that in the latter they are regarded solely on the side of their utility to society&mdash;a political view&mdash;in the Ethics they are confirmed habits or states resulting from a due regulation of the elementary <foreign lang="greek">πάθη</foreign> out of which they are formed and developed. They are &lsquo;relative means&rsquo;, <foreign lang="greek">μεσότητες πρὸς ἡμᾶς</foreign>, mean states varying in individuals according to the special character of each, lying at a variable distance between two extremes of the <foreign lang="greek">πάθη</foreign> out of which they grow, the proper mean in any given case being determined by the <foreign lang="greek">φρόνησις</foreign> or practical wisdom, the objective standard being the collective judgment of those who are specially endowed with this faculty, the <foreign lang="greek">φρόνιμοι</foreign>.

						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">μεγαλοψυχία</lemma>] &lsquo;high-mindedness&rsquo; is represented in the same way as the preceding, as a virtue which is &lsquo;productive of benefits&rsquo;, shews its utility, &lsquo;on a large scale&rsquo;; to which &lsquo;little-mindedness&rsquo;, meanness of spirit, is the opposite. This is a very different and much narrower view of the virtue than that which is conveyed by the description of it in Nic. Eth. IV 7&mdash;9, which is summed up in the brief phrase at the end of c. 9, <foreign lang="greek">ἡ μὲν οὖν μεγαλοψυχία περὶ τιμήν ἐστι μεγάλην</foreign>, and defined c. 7, 1123 <hi rend="italic">b</hi> 2, <foreign lang="greek">δοκεῖ δὲ μεγαλόψυχος εἶναι ὁ μεγάλων αὑτὸν ἀξιῶν ἄξιος ὤν</foreign>. The <foreign lang="greek">μεγαλόψυχος</foreign> of the Ethics is a man of high aims and lofty spirit, full of scorn and contempt for all that is beneath him, men and things, and with a pride which is justified by his deserts: pride without merits to support it is no longer proper pride, a virtue; but degenerates into vanity <foreign lang="greek">χαυνότης</foreign>, an undue sense of one's own merits. </p>

Schrader quotes the little tract <foreign lang="greek">περὶ ἀρετῶν καὶ κακιῶν</foreign>, printed as an appendix to the three Ethical treatises in Bekker's 4to ed. Vol. II p. 1249. It is an abridgment or epitome of Aristotle's account of the virtues in the third and fourth books of the Ethics, with a slight admixture of Platonism and other occasional alterations. <foreign lang="greek">ἐπαινετὰ μέν ἐστι τὰ καλά, ψεκτὰ δὲ τὰ αἰσχρά. καὶ τῶν μὲν καλῶν ἡγοῦνται αἱ ἀρεταί, τῶν δ’  αἰσχρῶν αἱ κακίαι. ἐπαινετὰ δ̓ ἐστι καὶ τὰ αἴτια τῶν ἀρετῶν καὶ τὰ παρεπόμενα ταῖς ἀρεταῖς</foreign> (these are the <foreign lang="greek">τὰ ποιητικὰ τῆς ἀρετῆς</foreign> and &lsquo;signs&rsquo;), <foreign lang="greek">καὶ τὰ γινόμενα ἀπ’  αὐτῶν καὶ τὰ ἔργα αὐτῶν, ψεκτὰ δὲ τὰ ἐναντία</foreign>, 1249 <hi rend="italic">a</hi> 26. </p>
						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">περὶ δὲ τῶν ἄλλων...ἰδεῖν</lemma>] for the more usual <foreign lang="greek">τὰ ἄλλα ἰδεῖν</foreign>. This substitution of a preposition with its case for the direct government of the <pb n="165"/> verb, has been noticed by Heindorf in the case of <foreign lang="greek">εἰς</foreign>, on Plat. Lys. &sect; 16, and in that of <foreign lang="greek">περί</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">ἀμφί</foreign>, on Phaedo &sect; 65, p. 250 C (in which place <foreign lang="greek">περὶ κάλλους</foreign> takes the place of the <hi rend="italic">nominative</hi>); likewise of <foreign lang="greek">περί</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">ὑπέρ</foreign> by Bremi on Dem. Olynth. I p. 14. 18 (ap. Sch&auml;fer <hi rend="italic">Appar. Crit. ad Demosth.</hi> I 208); and a similar use of the Latin, &amp;c. by Heusing, ad Cic. de Off. I 15. 3. Comp. Epist. ad Div.

						<p>The earliest instances I have noted of it are Soph. Oed. Col. 422, <foreign lang="greek">ἐν δέ μοι τέλος αὐτοῖν γένοιτο τῆσδε τῆς μάχης πέρι</foreign>, and Aj. 684, <foreign lang="greek">ἀμφὶ τούτοισιν εὖ σχήσει</foreign>. In Plato it is not uncommon, Phaedo 231 D, <foreign lang="greek">βούλεσθαι περί τινος</foreign>, Rep. IV 427 A, <foreign lang="greek">εἶδος νόμων πέρι καὶ πολιτείας</foreign> (a good example), Ib. 436 B, <foreign lang="greek">καθ’  ἕκαστον αὐτῶν πράττομεν</foreign>, Phaedo 249 C (this use of <foreign lang="greek">καθ’  ἕκαστον</foreign> for the simple accusative is found in various writers; see Stallbaum on Rep. ll. cc.), Ib. VII 533 B, <foreign lang="greek">περὶ παντὸς λαμβάνειν</foreign>, Theaet. 177 B, Gorg. 487 A. But in Demosthenes and Aristotle it becomes quite a usual mode of expression.

						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ἐπεὶ δὲ τὰ σημεῖα κ.τ.λ.</lemma>] An exemplification of the preceding rule, and application of it to the special virtues. &lsquo;Seeing that the signs of virtue, and all such things as are works (results, effects), or affections&rsquo; (properties, qualities, attributes&mdash;on <foreign lang="greek">πάθη</foreign> and its various senses see Introd. pp. 113&mdash;118; on the special sense here, p. 114) &lsquo;of it are <foreign lang="greek">καλά</foreign>&rsquo;, the same rule will apply to each special manifestation of it, as <foreign lang="greek">ἀνδρία</foreign>.

An exception occurs to the general application of the rule to the special virtues in the case of <foreign lang="greek">δικαιοσύνη</foreign>: in this alone, though it is true of the <foreign lang="greek">ἔργα</foreign>, it is not true of the <foreign lang="greek">πάθη</foreign>: in other words, in the rest of the virtues the <foreign lang="greek">πτώσεις</foreign> are <pb n="166"/> <foreign lang="greek">σύστοιχα</foreign>, the changes of termination represent true co-ordinates, all being terms referable to the same notion or class, viz. that of virtue, as <foreign lang="greek">ἀνδρία, ἀνδρεῖος, ἀνδρείως</foreign>: all are equally <foreign lang="greek">καλά</foreign> and praiseworthy (see note on c. 7. 27); but in the single case of justice this does not universally apply, for <foreign lang="greek">τὸ δικαίως ζημοῦσθαι</foreign>, just (deserved) punishment, is not equally praiseworthy with a just act, <foreign lang="greek">τὸ δικαίως πράττειν</foreign>, but the contrary; since it is more disgraceful than an <hi rend="italic">unjust</hi> punishment. (This seems to be a mere fallacy of <foreign lang="greek">ὁμωνυμία</foreign>, ambiguity, <hi rend="italic">equivoque</hi>, <foreign lang="greek">δικαίως</foreign> not standing in the same relation to <foreign lang="greek">ζημιοῦσθαι</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">πράττειν</foreign>: in the one case the &lsquo;justice&rsquo; of the act lies in the intention of the actor; in the other it belongs not to the actor, but to the law and the judge who inflicts the punishment. A similar equivocal meaning lies in the word <foreign lang="greek">πάθος</foreign>: in the rule and the general application of it, it stands for properties or attributes: in the special exception it denotes an &lsquo;affection&rsquo; in the sense of suffering or punishment.) </p>

						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">τὰ γὰρ αἰσχρά κ.τ.λ.</lemma>] &lsquo;for shameful things we are all ashamed of, when we say, do, or are intending to do them&rsquo;. Sappho's verses, for instance, in answer to Alcaeus,&mdash;&lsquo;something I would say, but shame prevents me&rsquo;&mdash;she infers from this that it was something to be ashamed of, <foreign lang="greek">αἰσχρόν</foreign>, and replies, &lsquo;Hadst thou yearned after things good or fair, and had not thy tongue stirred up mischief to utter it, shame had not possessed thine eyes, but thou wouldst have spoken of the thing that is right&rsquo;. The third line in particular of this Alcaic stanza requires correction, and there is not much help to be derived from the Aristotelian MSS. In the first, Blomfield, <hi rend="italic">Mus. Crit.</hi> I p. 17, reads <foreign lang="greek">ἶκέ τ’  ἐσλῶν</foreign>: and Hermann (much better), <hi rend="italic">El. Metr.

Bergk, <hi rend="italic">Fragm. Lyr. Gr.</hi> p. 607, follows MS A^{c} in reading <foreign lang="greek">ἦχε</foreign> and the Aeolic <foreign lang="greek">ἐσλῶν</foreign>. The third line, which in the MSS appears as <foreign lang="greek">αἰδώς κέν σε οὐκ εἶχεν ὄμματ̓</foreign>, without <hi rend="italic">varia lectio</hi>, is written by Blomfield, u. s., <foreign lang="greek">αἰδώς κεν οὐχί τ’  ὄππατ̓ εἶχεν</foreign>: by Hermann, <foreign lang="greek">αἰδώς κέ τευς οἰκ εἶχεν ὄππατ̓</foreign>: and by Bergk, <foreign lang="greek">αἰδῴς κε ς’  οὐκ ἄν ἦχεν ὄππατ̓</foreign> (surely <foreign lang="greek">κε</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">ἄν</foreign> thus repeated in different forms and almost immediate juxtaposition is indefensible): none of these seems to be satisfactory, but I have nothing better to suggest. [In Bergk's 2nd ed. p. 674 the fragment is printed as follows: <foreign lang="greek">αἰ δ’  ἦχες ἔσλων ἴμερον ἢ κάλων</foreign>, &verbar; <foreign lang="greek">καὶ μή τι Ϝείπην γλῶσς’  ἐκύκα κάκον</foreign>, &verbar; <foreign lang="greek">αἴδως κέ ς’  οὐ κίχανεν ὄμματ̓</foreign>, &verbar; <foreign lang="greek">ἀλλ’  ἔλεγες περὶ τῶ δικαίως</foreign>.

						<p>The fact that the eye is the principal organ of the <hi rend="italic">manifestation</hi> of <pb n="169"/> some of the feelings or emotions, as love, shame, fear, is here, as often elsewhere, expressed poetically by the phrase that &lsquo;shame has its seat in the eye&rsquo;.

The addition of <foreign lang="greek">μὴ φοβούμενοι</foreign> is made here, because fear is the usual concomitant of the emotion, and generally included in the notion. Probl.

A pleasuregarden on this principle is a finer thing and more deserving of approbation than a market-garden from which you make a profit. The reason here given for this preference is different to that assigned in Eth. N. IV 9 (quoted in the note referred to). There it is accounted for by the selfsufficiency or independence (<foreign lang="greek">αὐτάρκεια</foreign>) that it implies; here by its being more in accordance with the <hi rend="italic">gentleman's</hi> character, in contrast with the vulgarity of trade and money-making. </p>

At Athens, in Aristotle's time, the <foreign lang="greek">θῆτες, τὸ θητικὸν</foreign> (<foreign lang="greek">πλῆθος</foreign>), still denotes the class of paid <hi rend="italic">agricultural</hi> labourers, as an order of the state or population; and is expressly distinguished from the <foreign lang="greek">βάναυσοι</foreign> or <foreign lang="greek">τεχνῖται</foreign>, artisans and petty manufacturers, who are still <hi rend="italic">hired labourers</hi>, but work at <hi rend="italic">mechanical</hi> employments, and in towns, forming with the others the lowest order of the population of the state. In Pol. III 5, <foreign lang="greek">βάναυσος</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">θής</foreign> are several times thus distinguished. It is there said that in some constitutions (such as monarchies and aristocracies) neither of these classes is admitted into the governing body; in oligarchies the <foreign lang="greek">θής</foreign> cannot, the <foreign lang="greek">βάναυσος</foreign> can, be a citizen.

I 7, <hi rend="italic">solent enim, id quod virorum bonorum est, admodum irasci</hi>, and therefore an angry temper may be attributed to a virtuous disposition. </p>
						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">μανικός</lemma> represents an excitable, violent, furious temper, which sometimes almost assumes the appearance of raving madness. In Plato it is applied to Chaerephon, Socrates' intimate (in the Charmides, init.), and to Apollodorus, Symp. 173 D, where it expresses a very impetuous, excitable temperament, inclined to extravagant and violent manifestations in feeling and utterance; which is illustrated by the conduct ascribed to him at Socrates' death, Phaedo 117 D. </p>

						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">αὐθάδης</lemma>. In Eth. Eud. II 3, 1221 <hi rend="italic">a</hi> 8, III 7, 1233 <hi rend="italic">b</hi> 34, <foreign lang="greek">σεμνότης</foreign>, proper pride, the due measure of personal dignity in one's bearing and behaviour to others, <foreign lang="greek">πρὸς ἕτερον ζῇν</foreign>, is a mean between the two extremes, <foreign lang="greek">ἀρεσκεία</foreign> the defect (over-complacency and obsequiousness), and <foreign lang="greek">αὐθάδεια</foreign> the excess (undue contemptuousness <foreign lang="greek">καταφρόνησις</foreign>, and disregard of their feelings and wishes). In the Magn. Mor. I 29, it is likewise the excess of <foreign lang="greek">σεμνότης</foreign>, as <foreign lang="greek">ἀρεσκεία</foreign> is the defect. It is exercised <foreign lang="greek">περὶ τὰς ἐντεύξεις</foreign>, in the ordinary <pb n="175"/> intercourse of society, and manifests itself in the character <foreign lang="greek">οἷος μηθενὶ ἐντυχεῖν μηδὲ διαλεγῆναι</foreign>, in a wilful and stubborn reserve which repels all social converse. The character is represented in the name itself; which is <foreign lang="greek">αὐτο-άδης</foreign>, &lsquo;self-pleasing&rsquo;. So that when we give the name of <foreign lang="greek">μεγαλόψυχος</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">σεμνός</foreign> to one who is really <foreign lang="greek">αὐσάδης</foreign>, we are substituting a virtue for a vice, a mean state for an excess. <foreign lang="greek">αὐθάδεια</foreign> is one of Theophrastus' &lsquo;Characters&rsquo; defined by him as <foreign lang="greek">ἀπήνεια ὁμιλίας</foreign>, &lsquo;social brutality&rsquo;. </p>
						<p>The special form of this misapplication of names in praise and censure is called <foreign lang="greek">ὑποκορισμός</foreign>, when it takes the <hi rend="italic">favourable</hi> side, and <hi rend="italic">interpretatur in melius.</hi> On this figure, the name of which is derived from the endearing terms used by nurses to children (<foreign lang="greek">πρὸς κόρην ἢ κόρον λέγειν ἀποσμικροῦντα</foreign>, Tim.

III 2. 15); hence it is transferred to flattering or endearing expressions in general, and especially such as, in describing the moral character of anything, substitute some nearly associated virtue for a vice; to palliate, extenuate, gloss over. Examples occur in Plat. Rep. VIII 560 E (already referred to), III 400 E, <foreign lang="greek">ἀνοιαν ὑποκοριζόμενοι καλοῦμεν ὡς εὐήθειαν</foreign>. Alexis, Tarantini Fr:3, Meineke, Fragm. Comm.

Thucydides, III 82, in a well-known passage, mentions this perversion of moral terms amongst the signs of demoralization prevalent in Greece at the period of the Corcyrean sedition, <foreign lang="greek">καὶ τὴν εἰωθυῖαν ἀξιώσιν τῶν ὀνομάτων ἐς τὰ ἔργα ἀντήλλαξαν τῇ δικαιώσει κ.τ.λ.</foreign> See Ruhnken, ad Tim. p. 266, 6; Ernesti, <hi rend="italic">Lex.

VI l. c.&mdash;Quintilian calls it <hi rend="italic">derivatio verborum</hi> in the passage above quoted; and V 13. 25, describes it, <hi rend="italic">si acri et vehementi fuerit usus oratione, eandem rem nostris verbis mitioribus proferre;</hi> which he then illustrates from Cicero's speeches. The opposite practice is described II 12. 4, <hi rend="italic">est praeterea quaedam virtutum vitiorumque vicinia, qua maledicus pro libero, temerarius pro forti, effusus pro copioso accipitur.</hi> [Farrar's <hi rend="italic">Chapters on Language</hi>, p. 281 sqq.

						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">καὶ τοὺς ἐν ταῖς ὑπερβολαῖς κ.τ.λ.</lemma>] The only difference between this and the preceding form of <foreign lang="greek">ὑποκορισμός</foreign> is, that this is a special variety of the other, which substitutes the mean for the excess, but still according to the favourable interpretation of it. <foreign lang="greek">θρασύτης</foreign> is the <foreign lang="greek">ὑπερβολή</foreign> of <foreign lang="greek">ἀνδρεία</foreign>, Eth.

						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">παραλογιστικὸν ἐκ τῆς αἰτίας</lemma>] &lsquo;liable to lead to a false inference&rsquo;, Rhet. II 24. 4, &lsquo;<hi rend="italic">suberit fallacia manans ex causa</hi>&rsquo;, Portus. &lsquo;The mis-reasoning <pb n="176"/> (<foreign lang="greek">παραλογιστικόν</foreign>), or false reasoning, proceeding from the cause&rsquo;, is the identification of two different causes which must necessarily produce dissimilar effects or actions; these latter are confounded by the fallacy, and ascribed to the same cause. The <hi rend="italic">cause</hi> of an action is the <foreign lang="greek">προαίρεσις</foreign>, the voluntary and deliberate <hi rend="italic">purpose</hi> of it; otherwise represented as the &lsquo;motive&rsquo; (the efficient cause). Now this cause or motive is different in the case of an act of wanton rashness, where there is no necessity (obligation) to incur the danger (<foreign lang="greek">οὗ μὴ ἀνάγκη κινδυνευτικός</foreign>), and of an act of virtue, <hi rend="italic">true</hi> courage, which <hi rend="italic">has</hi> a noble end, <foreign lang="greek">τὸ καλόν</foreign>, in view: they are prompted by different motives, one belonging to the class &lsquo;bad&rsquo;, the other that of the &lsquo;good&rsquo;. This identification of the causes of the two actions leads to the &lsquo;false inference&rsquo;, that as the same cause produces the same effect, and the cause of both actions is the same, the effects are likewise the same, and both of them are acts of virtue. And then the further inference is drawn, that whatever a man will do from a less powerful motive, he will do <hi rend="italic">a fortiori</hi> from one which is higher and more prevailing: the higher the motive or cause, the more powerful the impulse or effect. Similarly it is <hi rend="italic">inferred</hi> that if a man is lavish to everybody, this must include his friends; by the rule, <hi rend="italic">omne maius continet in se minus.</hi> </p>
						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ὑπερβολὴ ἀρετῆς</lemma>] Cic. Tusc. Q. V 26. 105, <hi rend="italic">exsuperantia virtutis.</hi> <foreign lang="greek">ὑπερβολή</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">ὑπεροχή</foreign> are frequently employed to express an excess above a given standard, average, or mean; the general conception of &lsquo;excess&rsquo;, of mere &lsquo;superiority&rsquo;; without the additional notion of a &lsquo;vicious&rsquo; excess, a depravation or deviation from a <hi rend="italic">true</hi> standard, which usually accompanies the word, and more especially in Aristotle's theory of virtue, where it stands for a class of moral <hi rend="italic">vices.</hi> &lsquo;Non significat hic <hi rend="italic">nimium</hi> sed <hi rend="italic">praestantia.</hi>&rsquo; Victorius. With the notion here expressed, comp. Eth. N.

The average standard of excellence is surpassed, &lsquo;good becomes better&rsquo;, in proportion to the degree of difficulty surmounted in accomplishing any task. Pol. IV (VII) 1, 1323 <hi rend="italic">b</hi> 3, <foreign lang="greek">κεκοσμημένοις εἰς ὑπερβολήν</foreign>, lines 8 and 14, <foreign lang="greek">κατὰ τὴν ὑπεροχήν</foreign>, c. 4, 1326 <hi rend="italic">a</hi> 21, Ib. <hi rend="italic">b</hi> 12, <foreign lang="greek">τῆς ὑπερβολῆς ὅρος</foreign>, <hi rend="italic">b</hi> 24.

This sense of the word is also common in Demosthenes, as de Cor. 291. 24, <foreign lang="greek">ἐγὼ δὲ τοσαύτην ὑπερβολὴν ποιοῦμαι</foreign>, and the same phrase de F. L. p. 447. 25. c.

This is no doubt the general (Grant says, invariable) rule; but I have noted one exception in Pol. V (VIII) 7, 1342 <hi rend="italic">b</hi> 23, where we find <foreign lang="greek">Σωκράτει</foreign> without the article in a reference to <hi rend="italic">Plato's</hi> Republic, III 398E.

						<p>On this passage, Quintilian, Inst. Or. III 7. 23, <hi rend="italic">Interesse tamen Aristoteles putat ubi quidque laudetur aut vituperetur.

						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">τὸ παρ’  ἑκάστοις τίμιον κ.τ.λ.</lemma>] These are appeals to national and class prejudices and preferences. We should attribute to the object of our encomium the possession of any gift, quality, accomplishment which happens to be esteemed by the particular audience that we are addressing; as in a company of Scythians it would be advisable to address ourselves to their national habits and modes of thinking, and to praise our hero for his skill in hunting or strength or bravery; at Sparta for patience and fortitude (Quint. u. s.); at Athens for literary accomplishments. </p>
						<p>&lsquo;And in a word, (or, as a general rule), to refer (in praising any one before an audience of this kind) what <hi rend="italic">they</hi> highly value to the <foreign lang="greek">καλόν</foreign>, since they appear to border closely upon one another&rsquo;. &lsquo;To refer <foreign lang="greek">τίμια</foreign> to <foreign lang="greek">τὸ καλόν</foreign>&rsquo;, is to invest them with a <hi rend="italic">moral</hi> character, <foreign lang="greek">τὸ καλόν</foreign> being the moral end, the right, the end of <hi rend="italic">action.</hi> This is as much as to say that these things, which are so precious in their eyes, are not only valuable, but <hi rend="italic">right</hi> in themselves, and therefore they do well to hold them in high esteem. </p>

						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">διὸ καὶ τὰ συμπτώματα κ.τ.λ.</lemma>] To establish a character for virtue in the object of your praise it is desirable to shew that his virtuous acts have been often repeated; and <hi rend="italic">therefore</hi>, for the same purpose, to make an apparent addition to this number, we should assume as acts done with a moral purpose, <foreign lang="greek">ὡς ἐν προαιρέσει</foreign>, any &lsquo;accidental coincidences&rsquo; and &lsquo;pieces of luck&rsquo; (which may have happened to him); &lsquo;for if a number of them can be brought forward &lsquo;resembling&rsquo; the virtue or excellence that you wish to praise in him, they will be taken for &lsquo;a sign&rsquo; of it and of the moral purpose or intention&rsquo; (which constitutes virtue). The mere repetition of the actions, <foreign lang="greek">τὸ πολλάκις φαίνεσθαι πεπραχότα</foreign>, is serviceable in producing this impression, because it seems to shew an inclination or fondness for them, and thence a certain direction of the <foreign lang="greek">προαίρεσις</foreign> or choice, and a certain <foreign lang="greek">ἕξις</foreign> or moral state, which are indications of a virtuous habit. <foreign lang="greek">συμπτώμα</foreign> is a &lsquo;concurrence&rsquo; or &lsquo;accidental coincidence&rsquo; of one thing or act with another, between which there is no <hi rend="italic">necessary connexion</hi>, and, like <foreign lang="greek">τὰ ἀπὸ τύχης</foreign>, <hi rend="italic">purely accidental.</hi> &lsquo;<foreign lang="greek">σύμπτωμα</foreign> est, cum quopiam aliquid agente, et quod nihil ad rem quae intervenit faciat, extrinsecus quippiam excitatum contingit; e.g. deambulante illo solem deficere: <foreign lang="greek">ἀπὸ τύχης</foreign> vero, cum quopiam aliquid agente alicuius rei gratia, aliquid ex eo actu praeter propositum evenerit; ut scrobem facientem, ut arborem serat, thesaurum defossum invenire.&rsquo; Victorius.

The example, and probably the topic itself, is taken from Isocrates, who in Panath. &sect; 32 employs it as a suggestion or piece of advice, and in Evag. &sect; 45 converts it into a topic of laudation&mdash;&lsquo;Now when thus expressed, it amounts to (has the value of, may serve for,) a suggestion, but when thus, it becomes laudation, &ldquo;Proud, not of the accidents of fortune, but of the distinctions due to himself alone&rdquo;&rsquo;.&mdash;The example in the laudatory form from the Evagoras runs thus in the original, <foreign lang="greek">οὐκ ἐπὶ τοῖς δὶ τύχην, ἀλλ’  ἐπὶ τοῖς δἰ</foreign> <pb n="182"/> <foreign lang="greek">αὑτὸν γιγνομένοις</foreign>.

And the accusative is nothing but a cognate accusative. That <hi rend="italic">power</hi> or <hi rend="italic">force</hi> is the original notion from which the secondary meanings are derived, is proved, if proof were needed, by the parallel use of <foreign lang="greek">ἰσχύειν</foreign> to express precisely the same notion; Eth.

						<p>Some of the special topics which follow as instances of <foreign lang="greek">αὐξητικά</foreign> have been already mentioned in &sect; 25, and appear again as giving a special importance or prominence to crimes in c. 14. 4, with the omission of the last. They, and others of the like kind, are included in the Rhet. ad Alex. 35 (36), 12, 13, under the general head of &lsquo;Comparison&rsquo; with others for the purpose of laudation, to which they are all reducible. Comp. Cic. de Orat. II 85. 347&mdash;8, and Quint. Inst. Or. III 7. 16.

						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">τὰ ἐκ τῶν χρόνων καὶ τῶν καιρῶν</lemma>] &lsquo;circumstances of time and opportunity&rsquo; give a praiseworthy character to particular actions at special times and seasons. This topic, equally applicable to comparative goods, has already occurred, c. 7. 32: and with <foreign lang="greek">παρὰ τὸ προσῆκον</foreign>, comp. c. 9. 31. If, for instance, a man performs an act of liberality, at a time of great pecuniary pressure, or in a case of emergency, or at a crisis of especial difficulty, he is then doing something <foreign lang="greek">παρὰ τὸ προσῆκον</foreign>, beyond what could naturally be expected from him, or any one else, and is entitled to especial credit for it. Similarly Victorius. </p>
						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">καὶ εἰ πολλάκις τὸ αὐτὸ κατώρθωκεν</lemma>] This topic is not to be confounded with <foreign lang="greek">τὸ πολλάκις φαίνεσθαι πεπραχότα</foreign> of &sect; 32. <hi rend="italic">That</hi> is a &lsquo;repetition of the act&rsquo;, <hi rend="italic">this</hi> denotes the &lsquo;repeated success&rsquo; in any attempt, the constant success is an indication&mdash;not infallible, or certain <hi rend="italic">as a proof</hi>&mdash;of special skill: as if a man were to throw sixes several times running, even if it were by mere accident, the inference would be that he had a special knack or skill in throwing dice. &lsquo;The <hi rend="italic">constancy</hi> of the success gives it importance, and it will seem <hi rend="italic">not</hi> accidental but due to the agent himself&rsquo;. </p>
						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">καὶ εἰ τὰ προτρέποντα κ.τ.λ.</lemma>] &lsquo;And any one&rsquo; (on whose account, in consequence of his actions and distinctions) &lsquo;to commemorate whom incentives, stimulants, to virtue (&lsquo;encouragements&rsquo; to do the like), or marks of respect for it, have been invented or were ever &lsquo;instituted&rsquo;, must be a praiseworthy character&rsquo;. This is the general case of the invention or establishment of any public mark of honour in commemoration of the great deeds or distinctions of any signal public benefactor, and as an incentive or encouragement to others to follow his example. </p>
						<p>The next clause, <foreign lang="greek">εἰς ὃν πρῶτον</foreign>, is a particular example of the former of the two preceding cases, the &lsquo;invention&rsquo;, the first appropriation, of something in a person's honour. Victorius thinks that <foreign lang="greek">κατεσκευάσθη</foreign> is especially applied to the <hi rend="italic">permanent</hi> establishment of an enduring monument, as a temple. </p>
						<p>This topic again is afterwards applied to crimes, in c. 14. 4. <pb n="184"/> </p>
						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">εὕρηται...κατεσκευάσθη</lemma>] We may note here the juxtaposition of the perf. and aor., apparently with no distinction of time intended. I have elsewhere noticed (Pref. to <hi rend="italic">Transl. of Gorgias</hi>, pp. xv. xvi.) the difference of idiom between the Greek and English languages which <hi rend="italic">obliges</hi> us sometimes to translate the Greek aorist by the English perfect. Other examples of the same inadvertence, confusion of tenses, or whatever else it is to be called, occur, I 3. 8, where <foreign lang="greek">πραχθῆναι</foreign> in the same sense and in the same opposition is repeated in the form <foreign lang="greek">πεπρᾶχθαι</foreign>, Top. IX sub fin. p. 184 <hi rend="italic">a</hi> 8, <foreign lang="greek">βεβοήθηκε μὲν...τέχνην δ’  οὐπαρέδωκεν</foreign>. Many instances are found in Sophocles, which in a writer so subtle in the distinctions of language might lead one to think that <hi rend="italic">he</hi> at any rate distinguishes them with a meaning. I leave the reader to judge. Philoct. 664, 666, (Herm. 676), <foreign lang="greek">λόγῳ μὲν ἐξήκους’  ὄπωπα δ̓ οὐ μάλα, 9278, οἷά μ̓ εἰργάσω, οἷ̓ ἠπάτηκας. 1172, τί μ̓ ὤλεσας; τί μ̓ εἴργασαι</foreign>; Antig. 406 (Dind.), present and aorist, <foreign lang="greek">καὶ πῶς ὁρᾶται κἀπίληπτος ᾑρέθη</foreign>; 1228&mdash;9, Aj. 31, Trach. 364, 5, Arist.

						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">εἰς ὃν πρῶτον</lemma>...] The <hi rend="italic">novelty</hi> of the distinction, invented expressly for the occasion, marks a still higher sense entertained of the value of the service or the virtue of the act which it is intended to commemorate. </p>
						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ἐγκώμιον ἐποιήθη] ποιεῖν</lemma> is here loosely used, by the so-called figure <hi rend="italic">zeugma</hi> (on c. 4. 6, note 1), in connexion with <foreign lang="greek">ἐγκώμιον</foreign> and the statue of Harmodius and Aristogeiton in two different senses&mdash;as to Hippolochus, until we know who he was, and in what way commemorated, the application must remain uncertain&mdash;of <hi rend="italic">writing</hi> the panegyric, and &lsquo;setting up the statue in the market-place&rsquo;. </p>
						<p>Of Hippolochus nothing is known. It seems that Aristotle intended the <foreign lang="greek">ἐγκώμιον</foreign> to refer to him. We should therefore insert a semicolon, or at least a comma after <foreign lang="greek">Ἱππόλοχον</foreign>, in order to connect the panegyric and the statue with those that they severally concern: <foreign lang="greek">εἰς</foreign> is to be repeated after <foreign lang="greek">καί</foreign>. &lsquo;And one (is especially praiseworthy) in whose honour a panegyric was first composed, as it was for Hippolochus; (and as the setting up of their statue <hi rend="italic">in the market</hi> was &lsquo;done&rsquo; first, <foreign lang="greek">ἐποιήθη</foreign>, i.e.), and as the privilege of having their statue erected in the market was granted for the first time to Harmodius and Aristogeiton&rsquo;. Thucydides in his episodical account of the assassination and the circumstances that led to it, VI 54&mdash;59, makes no mention of the statue; nor Aristotle Pol. VIII (V) 10, where the attack on Hipparchus is spoken of. Pausanias, 1 8. 5, says, <foreign lang="greek">οὐ πόῤῥω δὲ ἑστᾶσιν Ἁρμόδιος καὶ Ἀριστογείτων οἱ κτείναντες Ἵππαρχον· αἰτία δὲ ἥτις ἐγένετο κ.τ.λ.</foreign> He is describing the <foreign lang="greek">ἀγορά</foreign>, though he does not expressly name it. (See Smith's <hi rend="italic">Dict. of Geogr.</hi> Art. Athena, p. 293 <hi rend="italic">b.</hi>) </p>
						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ἐπὶ τῶν ἐναντίων</lemma>] &lsquo;in the opposite cases&rsquo;, of men to whom any reproach or stigma, mark of disapprobation (the test of vice) was first attached. &lsquo;cum nempe quempiam aut solum aut primum aut cum paucis flagitium admisisse ostendemus, turpitudinem ipsius valde augebimus.&rsquo; Victorius.

						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">κἂν μὴ καθ’  αὑτὸν εὐπορῇς κ.τ.λ.</lemma>] &lsquo;and if you have not enough to say about your hero himself, and in his own person, then institute a comparison between him and others... only the comparison must be with men of distinction, (reputation); because the amplifying power of the comparison and the impression of nobility which it creates, arise from the superiority which is attributed to him over those who are themselves worthy and good&rsquo;. The same topic is recommended in the Rhet. ad Alex. c. 3 (4). 6. </p>
						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ὅπερ Ἰσοκράτησδικολογεῖν</lemma>] &lsquo;which was Isocrates&rsquo; custom, owing to his want of practice in forensic pleading&rsquo;. Read <foreign lang="greek">ἀσυνήθειαν</foreign> [with A^{c}] for two reasons. <hi rend="italic">First</hi>, what is meant is that Isocrates cultivated the habit of comparing his hero with others in consequence of his want of <hi rend="italic">actual</hi> practice in the law-courts. There the pleading is always direct, and the arguments pointed at an adversary; comparisons with others are altogether out of place, or only occasionally serviceable. If Isocrates had had this practice, he would not have fallen into the habit of comparing, into which he had been led by confining himself to the epideictic branch of Rhetoric where they tell and are in point. <hi rend="italic">Secondly</hi>, this is what Isocrates himself tells us of his own habits and pursuits, Antid. &sect;&sect; 2, 3, <foreign lang="greek">ἐγὼ γὰρ εἰδὼς ἐνίους τῶν σοφιστῶν βλασφημοῦντας περὶ τῆς ἐμῆς διατριβῆς καὶ λέγοντας ὡς ἔστι περὶ δικογραφίαν... αὐτὸς δὲ πᾶσι τοῦτο πεποιηκέναι φανερὸν ὅτι προῄρημαι καὶ λέγειν καὶ γράφειν οὐ περὶ τῶν ἰδίων συμβολαίων, ἀλλ’  ὑπὲρ τηλικούτων κ.τ.λ.</foreign> Panath. &sect; 11, <foreign lang="greek">ἀλλ’  ἐπειδὴ τοῦ πολιτεύεσθαι διήμαρτον ἐπὶ τὸ φιλοσοφεῖν</foreign> (i.e. literary labour, speech writing) <foreign lang="greek">καὶ πονεῖν καὶ γράφειν, οὐ περὶ μικρῶν τὴν προαίρεσιν ποιούμενος οὐδὲ περὶ τῶν ἰδίων συμβολαίων οὐδὲ περὶ ὧν ἄλλοι τίνες ληροῦσιν, ἀλλὰ περὶ τῶν Ἑλληνικῶν κ.τ.λ.</foreign> Ib. &sect; 39 seq. <foreign lang="greek">ἡγοῦμαι δὲ χρῆναι τοὺς βουλομένους ἐγκωμιάσαι τινὰ τῶν πόλεων ἀκριβῶς καὶ δικαίως μὴ μόνον περὶ αὐτῆς ποιεῖσθαι τοὺς λόγους ἧς προῃρημένοι τυγχάνουσιν, ἀλλ’  ὥσπερ</foreign> (here follows a simile) <foreign lang="greek">οὕτω καὶ ταῖς πόλεσι παριστάναι μὴ τὰς μικρὰς ταῖς μεγάλαις, κ.τ.λ.</foreign> [Cf. note on Paneg. &sect; 11. S.] </p>
						<p>Here we find, <hi rend="italic">first</hi>, that he failed in public life; <hi rend="italic">secondly</hi>, that he withdrew from the law-courts and their <foreign lang="greek">ἴδια συμβόλαια</foreign>, the cases arising out of the &lsquo;private dealings&rsquo; of the citizens with one another in their ordinary business, in order to devote himself to philosophy and the study of public affairs; and <hi rend="italic">thirdly</hi>, that his ordinary practice in his Panegyrics was, just as Aristotle describes it, to compare, <foreign lang="greek">παριστάναι</foreign>, the object of his laudation with others, whether men or cities, as great and distinguished as themselves, <foreign lang="greek">πρὸς ἐνδόξους συγκρίνειν</foreign>. The two first of these statements seem to put the reading <foreign lang="greek">ἀσυνήθειαν</foreign> beyond question, <foreign lang="greek">συνήθειαν</foreign> being contrary alike to the known facts and the probabilities of the case. It is nevertheless supported by Max Schmidt, in his tract on the date of the Phetoric, pp. 17, 18. With this reading, <foreign lang="greek">δικολογία</foreign> must be confined to speech writing for the use of parties in a legal process. </p>
						<p>This is one of the passages of the Rhetoric on which Victorius founds <pb n="186"/> his charge against Aristotle of jealousy and illwill towards Isocrates, whom he supposes the other to have lost no opportunity of assailing with open or covert censure and ridicule in his Rhetoric. See his commentary, pp. 154, 507, 586, 605, and elsewhere. Here at least, (with the reading <foreign lang="greek">ἀσυνήθειαν</foreign>), there is neither one nor the other. I have already entered into this question in the Introd. p. 40&mdash;1, where I have given the opinions of later writers on the subject. </p>

						<p>The <foreign lang="greek">κοινὸς τόπος</foreign> of <foreign lang="greek">αὔξησις</foreign> or amplification naturally falls under the general head or class of laudatory speeches, is especially applicable to all forms of &lsquo;praise&rsquo;: because its object is to establish a certain &lsquo;superiority&rsquo; of the person panegyrized over others, and this &lsquo;superiority&rsquo; is an honourable end to aim at. And therefore if we do not compare our hero with the distinguished, it is at all events better to do it with the rest of the world (the average of mankind) because superiority in general, in itself, is thought to be an indication of &lsquo;virtue&rsquo;. Eth. Nic. IV 8, sub init. <foreign lang="greek">οἱ γὰρ εὐγενεῖς ἀξιοῦνται τιμῆς καὶ οἱ δυναστεύοντες ἢ οἱ πλουτοῦντες· ἐν ὑπεροχῇ γάρ, τὸ δ’  ἀγαθῷ ὑπερέχον πᾶν ἐντιμότερον</foreign>. </p>

To the deliberative orator examples are most serviceable; because people <pb n="187"/> are apt to draw inferences, to form a judgment or decision upon the future from the past by a sort of presentiment or anticipation. The enthymeme, direct logical argument, is most to the purpose in judicial oratory: in <hi rend="italic">that</hi> there is most room for the application of direct proof, the tracing of cause and effect, and demonstration by deductive process, in clearing up the obscurity of &lsquo;past facts&rsquo;, which are the objects of forensic oratory, c. 3. 2.

The Latin <hi rend="italic">amarus</hi>, as Victorius points out, is used in much the same sense. The distinguishing characteristic of the Aristotelian <foreign lang="greek">πικρότης</foreign>, in which the particular &lsquo;bitterness&rsquo; of this form of <foreign lang="greek">ὀργή</foreign> is shewn, is its lasting and enduring quality&mdash;the wrath is nursed &lsquo;to keep it warm&rsquo; (<foreign lang="greek">πέψαι τὴν ὀργήν</foreign>)&mdash;and this gives it a malignant, spiteful, <hi rend="italic">implacable</hi> character, exactly opposite to that of Horace, the irascible temper, <foreign lang="greek">ὀργιλότης</foreign>, <hi rend="italic">irasci celerem, tamen ut placabilis essem.</hi> </p>

Victorius quotes Top. Z (9, 148 <hi rend="italic">a</hi> 6), <foreign lang="greek">τὸ γὰρ μὴ ἔχον ἐπιστήμην οὐ δοκεῖ ἀγνοεῖν, ἀλλὰ μᾶλλον τὸ διηπατημένον</foreign>. Ignorance is not a mere <foreign lang="greek">στέρησις</foreign>, the privation or absence of knowledge; which is shewn by our not applying the term &lsquo;ignorant&rsquo; to inanimate objects and young children; it is something positive, and consists in a deception, mistaking one thing for another. </p>

						<p>And so for the rest, the same rule holds in the case of every vice, &lsquo;each in the things which are specially subjected to it&rsquo;, which come under that particular head, as money is the &lsquo;subject-matter&rsquo; of illiberality, dangers of cowardice, anger of quick, irascible temper, and so on.

						<p>This inquiry naturally leads to a classification of the sources or causes of human action, which are found to fall under seven heads; some of these have their origin in ourselves and are under our own control, others are external to us and independent of us, and exercise upon us and our actions the force of necessity and compulsion. To the causes whose origin is <hi rend="italic">without</hi> us belong (1) chance or accident, (2) nature, and (3) ex-ternal force or compulsion; over these we have no control: the causes which spring from <hi rend="italic">within</hi> us, and are therefore more or less in our power to master and overrule, are (4) habit, (5) reasoning or calculation, (6) passion, (7) appetite or desire.

Ib. p. 231.&mdash;<foreign lang="greek">τὰ τιμωρητικά</foreign>, &lsquo;acts and feelings of <pb n="197"/> revenge, are prompted by passion and anger&rsquo;. I have translated <foreign lang="greek">θυμός</foreign> &lsquo;passion&rsquo; and <foreign lang="greek">ὀργή</foreign> &lsquo;anger&rsquo; to express the distinction that the one is a more general, the other a more precise and definite, term. Besides this, <foreign lang="greek">θυμός</foreign> being the older and Homeric term to represent anger might by that very fact have conveyed to the ears of the more modern Greek a difference of meaning which had no real existence. <foreign lang="greek">ὀργή</foreign>, if Damm's <hi rend="italic">Lexicon</hi> is to be trusted, never occurs in Homer; [the word is not to be found in Mr G.

In Aristotle's psychology, the <foreign lang="greek">θυμός</foreign> is one of the impulsive faculties (<foreign lang="greek">ὀρέξεις</foreign>), together with the appetites and the (deliberate) wish, de Anima B 3, 414 <hi rend="italic">b</hi> 2, and in the Platonic scheme the <foreign lang="greek">θυμός</foreign> or <foreign lang="greek">θυμοειδές</foreign> represents a whole class of impulses of which no doubt <foreign lang="greek">ὀργή</foreign> is one&mdash;it is in fact the impulsive element of the human soul. </p>

						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ἐπιθυμία</lemma>. The last of the seven causes or stimulants of action is desire (Introd. p. 233), which excites all actions of which the object is pleasure. This pleasure may be either real or apparent, and therefore to include the latter we have <foreign lang="greek">ὅσα φαίνεται</foreign> and not <foreign lang="greek">ἐστίν</foreign>. </p>
						<p>In the next two sentences the four incentives to action which originate in ourselves are shewn to be all referable in some sense to pleasure, real or apparent good, real or apparent as a motive cause. Of <foreign lang="greek">ἐπιθυμία</foreign> it has been already stated that pleasure is the direct motive. Habit, again, is a kind of pleasure, for experience teaches that habituation and familiarity make actions not naturally agreeable pleasant to us&mdash;habit becomes a second nature. Of anger, revenge is the object, and revenge is proverbially sweet. And reasoning or calculation has always of course some good, real or supposed, for its object. </p>
						<p>I have no doubt that Victorius is right in the distinction that he draws between <foreign lang="greek">σύνηθες</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">ἐθιστόν</foreign>. The former represents a <hi rend="italic">natural</hi> familiarity derived from familiar associations, with which, as I have pointed out on I 1. 2, the derivation, <foreign lang="greek">σὺν ἦθος</foreign>, &lsquo;the haunting, herding together&rsquo;, the gregarious habit of some animals, is in exact accordance; so <foreign lang="greek">συνήθεις</foreign>, of a man's &lsquo;familiar associates, habitual companions&rsquo; I 11. 16; <pb n="198"/> the other is an <hi rend="italic">acquired</hi> habit, a practice to which you <hi rend="italic">habituate yourself</hi> by study and attention; of which virtue the settled <foreign lang="greek">ἕξις</foreign> formed by <foreign lang="greek">ἔθος</foreign> is the best example. &lsquo;In priore vero,&rsquo; says Victorius, &lsquo;nulla industria aut cura, sed potius una cum aetate crevisse, eo verbo intelligitur; ut cum a puero quispiam in illis vixerit, inde factum sit ut ea ipsi iucunda videantur.&rsquo; </p>

						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ὥστε συλλαβόντι εἰπεῖν</lemma>] The dative is explained by supplying an imaginary <foreign lang="greek">τινί</foreign>, &lsquo;as for one summing up to say&rsquo;. An analogous phrase is <foreign lang="greek">ὡς συνελόντι εἰπεῖν</foreign>, Xen. Mem. III 8. 10, IV 3. 7. See note on 1 7. 7, <foreign lang="greek">τὸ ποιητικῷ εἶναι</foreign>, and Matth. <hi rend="italic">Gr. Gr.</hi> &sect; 388. Add Eth.

In this and similar examples the dative may almost be regarded as an absolute case. </p>
						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">οὐχ ἑκόντες</lemma>] Victorius here draws attention to Aristotle's well-known distinction, Eth. N. III 2, init., between <foreign lang="greek">οὐχ ἑκών</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">ἄκων</foreign>. Acts due to ignorance, acts which would not have been done, had the doer been aware of all the circumstances of the case, cannot be called <foreign lang="greek">ἀκούσιοι</foreign>, involuntary or unintentional, unless they bring after them regret or repentance; neither are they strictly speaking <foreign lang="greek">ἑκούσιαι</foreign>, intentional, because no harm was intended; they lie between the two and must take the name of <foreign lang="greek">οὐχ ἑκούσιαι</foreign>, &lsquo;not-intentional&rsquo;; neither intentional nor &lsquo;unintentional&rsquo;. I doubt if this distinction is applicable here; the only cases that it can be applied to are chance or accident, nature, and external compulsion, under which all actions are said to be involuntary, i.e. in which the will has no concern; and this is true. But in the Ethics, the actions there in question are not said to be involuntary&mdash;the doer meant to do what he did&mdash;but acting in ignorance, he acted unintentionally, in so far as he did not intend to do the mischief that followed. But this ignorance from which the unintentional character of the act is derived, essential in the Ethics, has no place here; ignorance is not included in an act done by chance, nature, or external compulsion. </p>
						<p>Now as we act voluntarily in all these four cases in which the impulse is from within and action in our own power, it follows (from the preceding) that the object of all voluntary action is some form either of real or <pb n="199"/> apparent good, or of real or apparent pleasure; including, in the good, real and apparent, the removal of evil and the substitution of a greater good for a less, because all these are <foreign lang="greek">αἱρετά</foreign> (desirable), objects of choice; and in the case of pleasure, the entire removal of pain and the substitution of a less for a greater; both of which are like the others (<foreign lang="greek">ὡσαύτως</foreign>) desirable in the sense of pleasurable. </p>

					<div3 id="b1c10s19" type="section" n="19">
						<p>It is therefore (from the preceding considerations) the rhetorician's business to discover the number <hi rend="italic">and</hi> kinds (so Aristotle, but the number <hi rend="italic">of</hi> kinds will be sufficient,) of good in the form of utility or expediency, and of pleasure. And as the first has been already examined and analysed under the head of deliberative Rhetoric (cc. 6, 7, good, absolute, and comparative), it remains for us to bestow a similar treatment on pleasure. Meanwhile we are not to forget that definitions for <hi rend="italic">rhetorical</hi> purposes are sufficient, provided they are neither obscure nor over-exact: in the one case they are not understood, in the other they are also apt to be unintelligible by the popular apprehension, but besides this they trespass upon an alien province and method of reasoning, the scientific, namely, or philosophical, I 4. 4&mdash;6, &amp;c.

				<div id="b1c11" type="chapter" n="11">

					<p>gives the analysis of pleasure, so far as it is of service to the rhetorician. </p>
					<p>The general plan of this chapter, and the connexion of its contents, are as follows. First we have a definition of pleasure and a general description of its nature in &sect;&sect; 1, 2. From this we learn that all that is in accordance with our nature is pleasurable, all that runs counter to it painful, &sect;&sect; 3, 4. Consequently all <hi rend="italic">natural</hi> desires and appetites produce pleasure by their gratification: and these fall into two classes, bodily appetites and mental desires, the former irrational and connected with the pleasures of sense, the latter rational, in so far as they are of an intellectual character, suggested and acquired by some kind of intellectual process of the nature of persuasion, &sect; 5, and conveyed by a faculty, <foreign lang="greek">φαντασία</foreign>, intermediate between sense and intellect. The analysis <pb n="200"/> of these intellectual pleasures (which include the pleasures of imagination, memory and anticipation, of love and friendship, and its counterfeit, flattery) occupies &sect;&sect; 6&mdash;20. In the remainder of the chapter other kinds of intellectual pleasures are distinguished, and referred to the principles implied in the definition. </p>
					<div3 id="b1c11s1" type="section" n="1">
						<p>The first word of the chapter is a commentary upon the concluding observations of the last: <foreign lang="greek">ὑποκείσθω</foreign>, &lsquo;let us assume&rsquo;, as a definition, &lsquo;take it for granted&rsquo;: there is no occasion to enter into details, or attempt <hi rend="italic">to prove</hi> that it is what I am about to describe. Similarly <foreign lang="greek">ἔστω</foreign>, 5. 3, 6. 2, 7. 2, 10. 3. </p>
						<p>On the terms of this definition, and the comparison of it with other doctrines held by Aristotle himself and other critics on the same subject, see Introduction, Appendix D to Bk. I, p. 234 seq. </p>
						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">κατάστασιν...εἰς τὴν ὑπάρχουσαν φύσιν</lemma>] This characteristic of pleasure, &lsquo;the resettlement of the soul&rsquo;, i.e. the vital and sensitive system, &lsquo;into its normal state&rsquo; after a disturbance of the balance or harmony, which is pain, reappears in one of the special <hi rend="italic">forms</hi> of pleasure, &sect; 21, <foreign lang="greek">ἐν τῷ μανθάνειν εἰς τὸ κατὰ φύσιν καθίστασθαι</foreign>. So that learning, as a pleasure, like pleasure in general, is, according to this view, the filling up of a vacuum, the supply of a want, the satisfaction of a craving, the restoration of a balance of the system, the re-establishment of a broken harmony. This is the Platonic conception of <hi rend="italic">pleasure;</hi> not, so far as I remember, of <hi rend="italic">learning</hi> in particular. See Appendix, p. 234. Lucretius takes the same view of pleasure, de Rer. Nat. II 963 (there quoted). </p>

						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">τῆς εἰρημένης διαθέσεως</lemma>] pleasure is here properly called a <foreign lang="greek">διάθεσις</foreign>, &lsquo;a temporary and passing disposition&rsquo;, as opposed to the &lsquo;confirmed, complete, and permanent state&rsquo; which constitutes the <foreign lang="greek">ἕξις</foreign>.

						<p>If pleasure is what it has been described to be, a return from a temporary disturbance or unnatural state into a state of nature (<foreign lang="greek">φύσις</foreign> <pb n="201"/> being here understood in one of the ordinary Aristotelian significations, the <hi rend="italic">normal nature</hi>, nature in its best and completest condition), then all &lsquo;passing into a natural state&rsquo; must be pleasant, &lsquo;and especially whenever what takes place in accordance with it has reached its own proper nature&rsquo;, i.e. its acme or maximum, the highest attainable point of its development, for instance, drinking, quenching the thirst is a pleasure, learning is a pleasure, but the acme or highest point they reach is still more pleasant in both. Schrader, who suggests these examples, expresses the later of the two stages in each, by <hi rend="italic">sitim restinxisse, didicisse</hi>, which not only does not give Aristotle's meaning correctly, but also, as I think, is not true as a matter of fact. </p>

The first is physical necessity, as breath and food are necessary to life: the second class consists of things necessary as means to an end, as taking medicine to get well, to take a voyage to &AElig;gina to recover a sum of money: under this head comes <foreign lang="greek">βία</foreign> (and <foreign lang="greek">τὸ βίαιον</foreign>), an external force that controls us, <pb n="202"/> something independent of ourselves and our own will, (here the external compulsion or violence is the necessary means to the attainment of its end, control). <foreign lang="greek">βίαιον</foreign> is thus described, 1015 <hi rend="italic">a</hi> 26, <foreign lang="greek">τοῦτο δ’  ἐστι τὸ παρὰ τὴν ὁρμὴν καὶ τὴν προαίρεσιν ἐμποδίζον καὶ κωλυτικόν. τὸ γὰρ βίαιον ἀναγκαῖον λέγεται, διὸ καὶ λυπηρόν, ὥσπερ καὶ Εὔηνός φησι, πᾶν γὰρ ἀναγκαῖον πρᾶγμ̓ ἀνιαρὸν ἔφυ. καὶ ἡ βία ἀνάγκη τις, ὥσπερ καὶ Σοφοκλῆς λέγει ἀλλ̓ ἡ βία με ταῦτ̓ ἀναγκάζει ποιεῖν</foreign>&rsquo; (this is incorrectly quoted; <hi rend="italic">memoriter</hi>, as Bonitz thinks; the line runs, <foreign lang="greek">ἀλλ’  ἡ βία γὰρ ταῦτ̓ ἀναγκάζει με δρᾷν</foreign>, Electr. 256).

Similarly Plato speaks of desire as naturally associated with pleasure, Phaedrus 237 D, <foreign lang="greek">ἡ ἔμφυτος οὖσα ἐπιθυμία η&lt;&gt;δονῶν</foreign>. </p>
						<p>This leads to a distinction of desires into rational and irrational, corresponding severally to the two parts of our moral and intellectual nature, the <foreign lang="greek">λόγον ἔχον</foreign> and the <foreign lang="greek">ἄλογον</foreign>&mdash;the latter division is attributed to Plato by the author of Magna Moralia, I 1. 7, 1182 <hi rend="italic">a</hi> 23. </p>
						<p>The irrational appetites, the Platonic <foreign lang="greek">ἐπιθυμητικόν</foreign> (Republic), are those which are not accompanied or guided by reason, which act naturally or by a physical necessity, <foreign lang="greek">ὅσαι λέγονται φύσει</foreign>, (these are Plato's <foreign lang="greek">ἀναγκαῖαι ἐπιθυμίαι</foreign>; Rep.

						<p>The received text followed by Bekker and Spengel puts a full stop at <foreign lang="greek">ἐλπίζει</foreign> [p. 206, line 3]. (The latter editor has also adopted the reading of MS A^{c} <foreign lang="greek">ἀεὶ ἐν</foreign> for <foreign lang="greek">κἄν</foreign>). With this punctuation, <foreign lang="greek">κἂν τῷ μεμνημένῳἐλπίζει</foreign> must be the apodosis, and the argument runs thus: &lsquo;If pleasure consists in sensation, and <foreign lang="greek">φαντασία</foreign> is a kind of sensation, then (assuming that there <hi rend="italic">is</hi> pleasure in memory and anticipation) memory and anticipation must be always accompanied by a mental impression of what is remembered or anticipated&rsquo;&mdash;pleasure being the middle term, without which the supposed apodosis will not follow from the premisses. But this is not what Aristotle undertakes to shew; and also it assumes first what is proved in the next sentence, viz. that pleasure does accompany memory and anticipation. Surely Victorius and Vater are right in supposing the apodosis of the entire sentence, <foreign lang="greek">ἐπεὶ κ.τ.λ.</foreign> to be <foreign lang="greek">δῆλον ὅτικαὶ αἴσθησις</foreign>, which is in fact what Aristotle here wishes to establish. Substitute a colon for the full stop: retain <foreign lang="greek">κἂν</foreign> (for <foreign lang="greek">καὶ ἐν</foreign>) instead of <foreign lang="greek">ἀεὶ ἐν</foreign>; and understand the first three clauses <foreign lang="greek">ἐπεὶἐλπίζει</foreign>, as three distinct and independent propositions, the basis of the conclusion which follows; <foreign lang="greek">εἰ δὲ τοῦτο</foreign> is a repetition in sum of the foregoing, &lsquo;if all this, I say, be so&rsquo;, (<foreign lang="greek">δέ</foreign> is appropriate in a <hi rend="italic">resumption</hi> of what has been just said, note on I 1. 11); <hi rend="italic">if</hi> pleasure is a mode of sensation, <hi rend="italic">if</hi> <foreign lang="greek">φαντασία</foreign> is a feeble kind of sensation, and <hi rend="italic">if</hi> memory and hope <hi rend="italic">are</hi> attended by a <foreign lang="greek">φαντασία</foreign> or mental impression of that which is remembered or hoped (some phenomenon past or future, the former a fact, the latter an imagination), it follows that pleasure, which is sensation, accompanies the memory of the past and the anticipation of the future because <foreign lang="greek">φαντασία</foreign> <pb n="205"/> does, which is a form of sensation, <foreign lang="greek">ἐπείπερ καὶ αἴσθησις</foreign><note anchored="yes">That pleasure is attendant upon every act of sensation is stated in Eth. Nic. X 4, 1174 <hi rend="italic">b</hi> 21, <foreign lang="greek">κατὰ πασᾶν γὰρ αἴσθησίν ἐστιν ἡδονή</foreign>, and again, line 27, <foreign lang="greek">καθ’  ἑκάστην δ̓ αἴσθησιν ὅτι γίνεται ἡδονὴ δῆλον</foreign>. But this is not the same thing as the statement of the Rhetoric which <hi rend="italic">identifies</hi> the two, just as Eudemus in the 7th book of the Nic. Eth. identifies pleasure with the <foreign lang="greek">ἐνέργειαι</foreign>, of which in Aristotle's 10th book it is only the concomitant. And there is a precisely similar overstatement here of the nature of the <foreign lang="greek">φαντασία</foreign>, as compared with the description of it in the de Anima, where it is said to <hi rend="italic">be</hi> a kind of sensation, instead of closely connected with it. See the following note, on <foreign lang="greek">φαντασία</foreign>.</note>. In this case <foreign lang="greek">κἄν</foreign> is to be retained in preference to <foreign lang="greek">ἀεὶ ἐν</foreign>. The latter necessarily makes the clause that it introduces, the apodosis; <foreign lang="greek">καὶ ἐν</foreign> merely couples this with the preceding premisses. The mood <foreign lang="greek">ἀκολουθοῖ ἄν</foreign>, which might seem objectionable in the mere statement of a proposition, must be considered as a qualified statement of the fact, &lsquo;will be likely to attend&rsquo;; only so much can be affirmed. </p>
						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">φαντασία</lemma>] which is here called a &lsquo;sort of feeble sensation&rsquo;, is described otherwise in the psychology of the de Anima. It is defined <foreign lang="greek">Γ</foreign> 3, 429 <hi rend="italic">a</hi> 1, <foreign lang="greek">ἡ φαντασία ἂν εἴη κίνησις ὑπὸ τῆς αἰσθήσεως τῆς κατ’  ἐνέργειαν γιγνομένη</foreign> (for <foreign lang="greek">γιγνομένης</foreign>, Trendelenburg and Torstrik), not, therefore, a mode of sensation as here, but a motion generated by sensation in active exercise: and again 428 <hi rend="italic">a</hi> 1, <foreign lang="greek">φαντασία καθ’  ἣν λέγομεν φάντασμά τι ἡμῖν γίγνεσθαι</foreign>: &lsquo;the presentative faculty&rsquo; (Sir W. Hamilton). It is a faculty intermediate between sensation and memory, and thus becomes connected with the intellect; the seat of memory is <foreign lang="greek">τὸ πρῶτον αἰσθητικόν</foreign>, viz. the heart, where the results of sensation are all collected in a focus, and thence transmitted to the mind. The memory is defined, de memoria, c. 1, ult. 451 <hi rend="italic">a</hi> 15, <foreign lang="greek">φαντάσματος, ὡς εἰκόνος οὗ φάντασμα, ἕξις</foreign>; which represents it as a state (in the heart, or the appropriate organ) of the impression <foreign lang="greek">φάντασμα</foreign>, transferred by the faculty of <foreign lang="greek">φαντασία</foreign> from the sensation itself, which (the impression) is the representation (the <foreign lang="greek">εἰκών</foreign>) of the real object of sense, that of which it is the <foreign lang="greek">φάντασμα</foreign>. The office of the <foreign lang="greek">φαντασία</foreign> is therefore to convey the impressions of the actual objects of sense delivered to it by sensation, and to impress or print them on the organ fitted for their reception; when thus impressed or &lsquo;represented&rsquo; they become memory, and so are passed on to the intellect. To compare with what is said in the Rhetoric, of this <foreign lang="greek">φαντασία</foreign> being a sort of feeble sensation, we have in the de Anima, <foreign lang="greek">Γ</foreign> 3, 428 <hi rend="italic">b</hi> 11, what almost (not quite) justifies it, <foreign lang="greek">ἐπειδὴ... ἡ δὲ φαντασία κίνησίς τις δοκεῖ εἶναι καὶ οὐκ ἄνευ αἰσθήσεως γίγνεσθαι ἀλλ’  αἰσθανομένοις καὶ ὧν αἴσθησίς ἐστιν, ἔστι δὲ γίνεσθαι κίνησιν ὑπὸ τῆς ἐνεργείας τῆς αἰσθήσεως, καὶ ταύτην ὁμοίαν ἀνάγκη εἶναι τῇ αἰσθήσει, εἴη ἂν αὕτη ἡ κίνησις οὔτε ἄνευ αἰσθήσεως ἐνδεχομένη οὔτε μὴ αἰσθανομένοις ὑπάρχειν...καὶ εἶναι καὶ ἀληθῆ καὶ ψευδῆ</foreign>. Though thus closely allied with sensation, and dependent upon it, the <foreign lang="greek">φαντασία</foreign> is not a faculty of mere sensation, but belongs equally to the intellect, <foreign lang="greek">φαντασία ἅπασα ἢ λογιστικὴ ἢ αἰσθητική</foreign>, de Anima <foreign lang="greek">Γ</foreign> 10 ult. 433 <hi rend="italic">b</hi> 29, (being apparently intermediate between them and partaking of the nature of both); of which (intellect), when we take the whole of it, the <foreign lang="greek">διάνοια</foreign> as well as the <foreign lang="greek">νοῦς</foreign>, into account, the <foreign lang="greek">φαντασία</foreign> <pb n="206"/> actually forms a part; c. 3, 427 <hi rend="italic">b</hi> 28, <foreign lang="greek">τούτου δὲ</foreign> (<foreign lang="greek">τοῦ νοεῖν</foreign>) <foreign lang="greek">τὸ μὲν φαντασία δοκεῖ εἶναι τὸ δὲ ὑπόληψις</foreign>. &lsquo;Imaginatio inter sensuum perceptiones et mentis cogitationes media intericitur, ut imaginatio sensibus, mens imaginatione egeat.&rsquo; Trendelenburg ad de Anima III 3, 4, p. 453.

						<p>All these last are pleasures of memory, agreeable <hi rend="italic">reminiscences.</hi> The pleasures of memory are further exemplified in this, that when the love which has already arisen from the delight found in the actual presence of the beloved is retained by the memory in his absence, this is a sure sign of the commencement of a genuine and lasting passion. Bekker, ed. 3, followed by Spengel, has put <foreign lang="greek">ἐρῶσιν</foreign> in brackets: F. A. Wolf had previously objected to it. It may be retained and explained as I have translated it, but the text and the general meaning would not suffer by its omission. <foreign lang="greek">ἐρῶσιν</foreign> if retained implies that the passion is <hi rend="italic">already</hi> conceived. Gaisford, after Victorius, quotes Eth. Nic. IX 5, 1167 <hi rend="italic">a</hi> 4, <foreign lang="greek">ἔοικε δὴ</foreign> (<foreign lang="greek">ἡ εὔνοια</foreign>) <foreign lang="greek">ἀρχὴ φιλίας εἶναι, ὥσπερ τοῦ ἐρᾷν ἡ διὰ τῆς ὄψεως ἡδονή· μὴ γὰρ προησθεὶς τῇ ἰδέᾳ οὐθεὶς ἐρᾷ, ὁ δὲ χαίρων τῷ εἴδει οὐθὲν μᾶλλον ἐρᾷ ἀλλ’  ὅταν καὶ ἀπόντα ποθῇ καὶ τῆς παρουσίας ἐπιθυμῇ</foreign>. <pb n="209"/> </p>

The very absence, and the pain that it causes, and the expression of grief, have a charm in them which affords some compensation by the recollection of all that he is and does. &lsquo;Hence the appropriateness of the saying&rsquo;,&mdash;meaning especially the use of the word <foreign lang="greek">ἵμερος</foreign>, which implies eager desire, in relation to <foreign lang="greek">γόος</foreign>&mdash;&lsquo;thus spake he, and in them all aroused longing desire for wailing&rsquo;.

						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ἐριστική</lemma> here in the Rhetoric means nothing more than the practice of dialectics, arguing against an opponent, and for victory. It has, however, almost always in Plato, and not unfrequently in Aristotle, the additional connotation of captious reasoning, quibbling and sophistry. In Top. IV (de Soph.

Rom. p. 272 F, <foreign lang="greek">Ζάκορός τις...ἀπολαύων σχολῆς ἔθος εἶχεν ἐν πεττοῖς καὶ κύβοις τὰ πολλὰ διημερεύειν</foreign>. The <foreign lang="greek">πεττοί</foreign> in particular was an old and favourite game, which appears from the constant allusions to it in Greek literature. The earliest mention of it occurs in Homer, Od. <foreign lang="greek">ά</foreign> 107. The corresponding Latin game, <hi rend="italic">latrunculi</hi>, is described by Ovid, Ars Am. II 208, III 357. </p>
						<p>The same is the case with &lsquo;serious&rsquo; games (games that require study and attention, such as chess, and <foreign lang="greek">πεττεία</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">κυβεία</foreign>, according to Plato, l. c.)&mdash;the only difference between serious games and games of mere amusement, in respect of the pleasures they afford, is that the pleasure in <pb n="212"/> the one case must be <hi rend="italic">acquired</hi>, and arise from habit and cultivation, whereas others are <hi rend="italic">naturally</hi> agreeable, lit. <hi rend="italic">at once</hi> (<foreign lang="greek">εὐθύς</foreign>, from the very first); to this latter class belong hunting with dogs, and every kind of chace. </p>
						<p>Various &lsquo;kinds of chace&rsquo; are enumerated in the Politics, I 8, in the description of the &lsquo;hunting stage&rsquo;, the second, according to Aristotle, in the development of human civilization. He takes occasion from this to distinguish the several kinds of hunting. <foreign lang="greek">οἱ δ’  ἀπὸ θήρας ζῶσι, καὶ θήρας ἕτεροι ἑτέρας, οἷον οἱ μὲν ἀπὸ λῃστείας, οἱ δ̓ ἀφ̓ ἁλιείας, ὅσοι λίμνας καὶ ἕλη καὶ ποταμοὺς ἢ θάλατταν τοιαύτην</foreign> (i. e. of the same kind as the lakes, marshes and rivers, namely, fish-producing) <foreign lang="greek">προσοικοῦσιν, οἱ δ’  ἀπ̓ ὀρνίθων ἢ θηρίων ἀγρίων</foreign>, piracy, man-hunting, fishing, fowling, and hunting wild animals, hunting proper. </p>
						<p>Wherever there is rivalry or competition, there is also victory, the opportunity of shewing one's superiority. And this is what makes practice at the bar and in the law courts (where there is a perpetual struggle and contest for the victory going on between the two rival pleaders), and that of dialectics (what is avowedly and technically a contest between two opposites), pleasant occupations. </p>

						<p>This quasi-sensation, the <foreign lang="greek">φαντασία</foreign>, is again employed to explain the pleasure we derive from honour and fair fame, the favourable opinion of others. These are pleasant because every one who possesses them always acquires an impression or fancy that he must be such an one as is the good (such as <foreign lang="greek">ὁ σπουδαῖος</foreign>, to whom alone such things are really <hi rend="italic">due</hi>), and a <foreign lang="greek">φαντασία</foreign>, being a form of sensation, always carries pleasure with it, &sect; 6; and this pleasure is still greater (the <foreign lang="greek">φαντασία</foreign> becomes still more vivid, and its effect greater) when he believes that those who say so (<foreign lang="greek">ὅτι τοιοῦτός ἐστιν οἷος ὁ σπουδαῖος</foreign>) are likely to be right in what they say. Such (<foreign lang="greek">οἱ δοκοῦντες ἀληθεύειν</foreign>) are near neighbours who know a man better, and are therefore better judges, than those (friends) that live at a distance; intimates (familiar, habitual associates, <foreign lang="greek">συνήθεις</foreign>, note on I 1. 2, 10. 18), and fellow-citizens rather than strangers afar off, (who only know him by report); contemporaries rather than posterity (to whom the same reason applies); wise men rather than fools; many rather than few.

						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">τῶν ἄπωθεν</lemma>] The <hi rend="italic">fact</hi> that words (substantives, adjectives, adverbs, and pronouns, <foreign lang="greek">Διόθεν οὐρανόθεν οἰκόθεν, ἀλλόθεν παντόθεν, ἔντοσθεν ἔξωθεν πρόσωθεν ἔσωθεν, ὅθεν σέθεν ἐμέθεν</foreign>) with the old genitive termination <foreign lang="greek">-θεν</foreign>, are often substituted for the primitive forms, particularly with the definite article as <foreign lang="greek">οἱ αὐτόθεν</foreign> (see many instances of this idiom in Index to Arnold's <hi rend="italic">Thucyd.</hi> s. v.), <foreign lang="greek">οἱ ἔξωθεν, οἱ ἄνωθεν, κάτωθεν, οἰκόθεν, ἐκεῖθεν</foreign>, and such like, in phrases where the termination <hi rend="italic">seems</hi> to have entirely lost its force, has been long known and noticed: see examples in Wunder's note, <hi rend="italic">Antig.</hi> 519, and Lobeck, <hi rend="italic">Phryn.</hi> p. 128: but the explanation of this usage, so far as I know, is still wanting. It is to be found in an observation of Hermann, on Soph.

The application of this simple fact to all the cases resembling those above given solves the whole mystery of the idiom, which, as Lobeck says, <hi rend="italic">olim vel barbatos magistros obstupefecit.</hi> (Lobeck is speaking merely of the knowledge of the <hi rend="italic">fact;</hi> he himself assigns no reason.) Rhet. I 15. 16, <foreign lang="greek">οἱ δ’  ἄπωθεν</foreign>, II 6. 23, <foreign lang="greek">τοὺς ἄπωθεν</foreign>. In Eurip. Ion 585&mdash;6 (Dind.) both points of view are taken, <foreign lang="greek">οὐ ταὐτὸν εἶδος φαίνεται τῶν πραγμάτων πρόσωθεν ὄντων ἐγγύθεν θ’  ὁρωμένων</foreign>, unless, as is at least equally probable, the interpretation of <foreign lang="greek">ἐγγύθεν ὁρωμένων</foreign> be, &lsquo;seen&rsquo; not &lsquo;from a near point&rsquo; where <hi rend="italic">we</hi> are, but &lsquo;seen&rsquo;, the sight of them proceeding, from a near point, where <hi rend="italic">they</hi> are. Arist. Pol. VII (VI) 4, 1319 <hi rend="italic">a</hi> 8, gives an excellent illustration of this difference between the Greek and our point of view: Aristotle is speaking of some restrictions on the occupation of land: <foreign lang="greek">ἢ τὸ ὅλως μὴ ἐξεῖναι κεκτῆσθαι πλείω γῆν μέτρου τινὸς ἢ ἀπὸ τινὸς τόπου πρὸς τὸ ἀστὺ καὶ τὴν πόλιν</foreign>&mdash;or, as we say, &lsquo;within a certain distance <hi rend="italic">from</hi> the city&rsquo;.

This <foreign lang="greek">φαντασία</foreign> &amp;c. belongs to, and is meant to illustrate, the active liking, <foreign lang="greek">τὸ φιλεῖν ἡδύ</foreign>. Every one who likes anything always has the impression that the object of his liking has something good about it, which is the reason for his liking it, since good is the universal desire. &lsquo;And being liked or loved is to be valued, esteemed, for one's own sake and for nothing else&rsquo;. This is what may be called the &lsquo;passive&rsquo; liking, said of the recipient of the action or liking; and is opposed to the active form of liking or love in this respect; that it is an end or ultimate object in itself, whereas the other looks to some further end beyond itself, namely, some good which it seems to see in the object of its affection. It is probable that little or no distinction is here intended to be made between <foreign lang="greek">φιλεῖν</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">ἀγαπᾷν</foreign>, since it is the end and not the process that is here in question, and they seem to be used pretty nearly as synonyms.

Ethics, II. The concluding words of the seventh book of the Nic. Eth. may serve as a commentary on this topic; <foreign lang="greek">μεταβολὴ δὲ πάντων γλυκύτατον, κατὰ τὸν ποιητήν, διὰ πονηρίαν τινά·</foreign> (i. e. imperfection: we are always wanting a change, because we never are in a &lsquo;complete state&rsquo;). <foreign lang="greek">ὥσπερ γὰρ ἄνθρωπος εὐμετάβολος ὁ πονηρός, καὶ ἡ φύσις ἡ δεομένη μεταβολῆς· οὐ γὰρ ἁπλῆ οὐδ’  ἐπιεικής</foreign>. The &lsquo;poet&rsquo;, referred to here and in the Rhetoric, is Euripides, Orest. 234, <foreign lang="greek">ἦ κἀπὶ γαίας ἁρμόσαι πόδας θέλεις χρόνιον ἴχνος θείς; μεταβολὴ πάντων γλυκύ</foreign>. The &lsquo;changeableness&rsquo; of the bad man in the illustration, is deduced, I presume, from the axiom that right is one, error and wrong infinite, <foreign lang="greek">ἐσθλοὶ μὲν γὰρ ἁπλῶς παντοδαπῶς δὲ κακοί</foreign>: see the whole passage from which this apothegm is taken, Eth. Nic. II 5, ult. 1106 <hi rend="italic">b</hi> 29, <foreign lang="greek">ἔτι τὸ ἁμαρτάνειν πολλαχῶς τὸ δὲ κατορθοῦν μοναχῶς κ.τ.λ.</foreign> </p>
						<p>It is this pleasure which is felt in change that makes men and things pleasant that present themselves to us or happen &lsquo;after an interval&rsquo;; <pb n="216"/> &lsquo;because they bring a change from our present condition or circumstances, (this is a di-version or a-musement,) and at the same time that which can be used (or enjoyed) only at intervals is rare&rsquo;: but rarity makes things &lsquo;better&rsquo;, c. 7, 14, 29, 32, or gives them a preference over others in value and importance&mdash;not <hi rend="italic">necessarily</hi> however in the amount of pleasure which may be derived from them; though in many cases, such as the possession of any rare object, print, coin, gem, in a collection, it certainly does. </p>

						<p>And learning and wondering are pleasant for the most part; wonder, because in it is contained, manifested, the desire of learning; and therefore the wonderful is an object of desire (every desire is directed to some pleasure, &sect; 5) and consequently pleasant; and learning includes, implies, a settlement into our normal condition&rsquo;. <foreign lang="greek">φύσις</foreign> here stands for the true and highest nature, the normal perfect state, of anything, see Grant, on Eth. N. II 1. 3, Polit. I 2, 1252 <hi rend="italic">b</hi> 32, <foreign lang="greek">οἷον γὰρ ἕκαστόν ἐστι τῆς γενέσεως τελεσθείσης φαμὲν τὴν φύσιν εἶναι ἑκαστοῦ, ὥσπερ ἀνθρώπου, ἵππου, οἰκίας</foreign>. This highest condition of our nature is <foreign lang="greek">θεωρία</foreign>, philosophy, the contemplation of truth, which is also the highest form or ideal of happiness, Eth. Nic. X 8 and 9. A state of knowledge, to which learning leads, may therefore be regarded as a settled or complete state, and to be the &lsquo;normal condition of the intellect&rsquo;, the noblest part of the entire <foreign lang="greek">ψυχή</foreign>. A settlement into this condition must therefore by the definition, &sect; 1, be a form of pleasure. </p>
						<p>On wonder, or curiosity, as the origin of learning, of all speculative inquiry or philosophy, compare Plato, Theaet. 155 D, to whom the observation is due, <foreign lang="greek">μάλα γὰρ φιλοσόφου τοῦτο τὸ πάθος, τὸ θαυμάζειν· οὐ γὰρ ἄλλη ἀρχὴ φιλοσοφίας ἢ αὕτη, κ.τ.λ.</foreign> From Plato it is borrowed by Aristotle, Metaph.

						<p>The pleasure of conferring and receiving benefits and favours is made to arise, in the case of the reception of good, or good treatment, from the gratification of our desires which this implies, any gratification of a desire being pleasant, &sect; 5; and the other, the pleasure of <hi rend="italic">conferring</hi> favours, is due to the gratification of our love of power (Hobbes again, cf. p. 210); the power, namely, evinced in our having (<foreign lang="greek">ἔχειν</foreign>) the means of bestowing them, and of shewing our superiority (<foreign lang="greek">ὑπερέχειν</foreign>) by doing so.

						<p>The pleasure derived from the &lsquo;imitative arts&rsquo; is next traced to the same sources, the pleasures, namely, of learning and wonder. These being assumed, it follows that every work of imitation, as of painting, sculpture, poetry&mdash;especially dramatic poetry&mdash;(we must either read here with Vater <foreign lang="greek">γραφικῇ</foreign> &amp;c. in the dative, as had occurred to myself, or suppose that the &lsquo;art&rsquo; in the three cases is carelessly substituted for the &lsquo;product&rsquo; or result of the art); and especially any <hi rend="italic">exact</hi> imitation, even when the object imitated is not pleasant in itself; the pleasure lies in the <hi rend="italic">mere imitation</hi>, and arises from exercise of the intellect in drawing an inference or &lsquo;conclusion (<foreign lang="greek">συλλογισμός</foreign>) from this to that&rsquo;; which is a reasoning process, and a kind of learning. </p>
						<p>The <hi rend="italic">inference</hi> is from the copy to the original, which must have been <pb n="218"/> seen before, if any pleasure is to be derived from the imitation; and the learning arises from the observation of the two and the comparison of them whereby we acquire some knowledge of what the things really are. This explanation is found in Poet. c. 4. 5. I will quote the entire passage from the beginning of the chapter, as a complete commentary on the passage of the Rhetoric, which indeed seems to be directly taken from the other. In the Poetics, as here in the Rhetoric, the love of imitation is ultimately based upon the love of learning; &sect; 4, <foreign lang="greek">αἴτιον δὲ καὶ τούτου κ.τ.λ.</foreign> <hi rend="italic">infra.</hi> The faculty or power of imitation which attends us from our very birth, <foreign lang="greek">σύμφυτον</foreign>, and the love of imitation which accompanies it, both natural, are the two causes of poetry, &sect;&sect; 1 2, and also of the other mimetic arts. <foreign lang="greek">Ἐοίκασι δὲ γεννῆσαι μὲν ὅλως τὴν ποιητικὴν αἰτίαι δύο τινές, καὶ αὗται φυσικαί. τό τε γὰρ μιμεῖσθαι σύμφυτον τοῖς ἀνθρώποις ἐκ παίδων ἐστί, καὶ τούτῳ διαφέρουσι τῶν ἄλλων ζῴων ὅτι μιμητικώτατόν ἐστι καὶ τὰς μαθήσεις ποιεῖται διὰ μιμήσεως τὰς πρώτας, καὶ τὸ χαίρειν τοῖς μιμήμασι πάντας. σημεῖον δὲ τοῦτο τὸ συμβαῖνον ἐπὶ τῶν ἔργων· ἃ γὰρ αὐτὰ λυπηρῶς ὁρῶμεν τούτων τὰς εἰκόνας τὰς μάλιστα ἠκριβωμένας χαίρομεν θεωροῦντες, οἷον θηρίων τε μορφὰς τῶν ἀτιμοτάτων</foreign> (the lowest and most degraded) <foreign lang="greek">καὶ νεκρῶν</foreign>. (&sect; 4) <foreign lang="greek">αἴτιον δὲ καὶ τούτου ὅτι μανθάνειν οὐ μόνον τοῖς φιλοσόφοις ἥδιστον ἀλλὰ καὶ τοῖς ἄλλοις ὁμοίως· ἀλλ’  ἐπὶ βραχὺ κοινωνοῦσιν αὐτοῦ. διὰ γὰρ τοῦτο χαίρουσι τὰς εἰκόνας ὁρῶντες, ὅτι συμβαίνει θεωροῦντας μανθάνειν καὶ συλλογίζεσθαι τί ἕκαστον, οἷον ὅτι οὗτος ἐκεῖνος, ἐπεὶ ἐὰν μὴ τυγχάνῃ προεωρακὼς οὐ διὰ μίμημα ποιήσει τὴν ἡδονὴν ἀλλὰ διὰ τὴν ἀπεργασίαν</foreign> (the execution, elaboration, finish, Plat. Rep. VI 504 D) <foreign lang="greek">ἢ τὴν χροιὰν ἢ διὰ τοιαύτην τινὰ ἄλλην αἰτίαν</foreign>. In the first three chapters of this treatise it is assumed that all the fine arts, painting, sculpture, music, and poetry in all its branches&mdash;architecture, except so far as the sculpture employed in decoration is concerned, does not appear in the list&mdash;are <hi rend="italic">imitative</hi>, and derived from the love of imitation and the power of imitation characteristic of humanity; and it is upon the various modes of imitation that the division of the fine arts is founded. </p>
						<p>In the same way the pleasure which we derive from metaphors consists in tracing the resemblance&mdash;a process of learning, <foreign lang="greek">μάθησίς τις</foreign>&mdash; between the word &lsquo;transferred&rsquo; and the thing it, sometimes remotely, resembles; so that here again the natural pleasure which attends all acquisition of knowledge, <foreign lang="greek">τὸ γὰρ μανθάνειν ῥᾳδίως ἡδὺ φύσει πᾶσίν ἐστι</foreign>, is assumed as the foundation of the love of imitation. Rhet. III 10. 2. Comp. III 8. 2, <foreign lang="greek">ἀηδὲς γὰρ καὶ ἄγνωστον τὸ ἄπειρον</foreign>. III 9. 2, 11. 9. And in Probl. XIX 5, the same principle is applied to music: <foreign lang="greek">διὰ τί ἥδιον ἀκούουσιν ᾀδόντων ὅσα ἂν προεπιστάμενοι τυγχάνωσι τῶν μελῶν ἢ ὧν μὴ ἐπίστανται;...... ἢ ὅτι ἡδὺ τὸ μανθάνειν; τούτου δὲ αἴτιον ὅτι τὸ μὲν λαμβάνειν τὴν ἐπιστήμην, τὸ δὲ χρῆσθαι καὶ ἀναγνωρίζειν ἐστίν</foreign>. </p>
						<p>Twining in his note on Poet. IV 4 (note 22, p. 186 seq.) in describing and illustrating this doctrine of Aristotle, remarks that &lsquo;he does not see how any <hi rend="italic">information</hi> can be said to be acquired by the spectator&rsquo; (or listener) from the mere <hi rend="italic">identification</hi> of two objects, the inference that &lsquo;this is that&rsquo;. And this remark is true if this were all that Aristotle means by his doctrine. The mere identification of an object compared with one already known conveys no <hi rend="italic">new</hi> knowledge, which is essential to <pb n="219"/> the notion of <hi rend="italic">learning.</hi> But what seems to be Aristotle's real meaning is (as I have expressed it above) that by the comparison of the representation with the original, whether it be a picture, or a trait of character in a tragedy, or a metaphor, you <hi rend="italic">learn</hi> something <hi rend="italic">new</hi> in this respect; that the representation, in proportion to its accuracy and finish (the number of <hi rend="italic">details</hi> introduced), enables you to <hi rend="italic">discover</hi> or <hi rend="italic">observe</hi> by the comparison something new in the object which you had never observed before: and this is the &lsquo;inference&rsquo; from the resemblance, which the <foreign lang="greek">συλλογισμός</foreign>, here and in the Poetics, is intended to express. On the love of imitation, and the pleasure derived from the imitation of objects in themselves disagreeable, Schrader quotes de Part. Anim. I 5, <hi rend="italic">b</hi> 45, <hi rend="italic">a</hi> 5. [<foreign lang="greek">καὶ γὰρ ἂν εἴη ἄτοπον εἰ τὰς μὲν εἰκόνας αὐτῶν θεωροῦντες χαίρομεν ὅτι τὴν δημιουργήσασαν τέχνην συνθεωροῦμεν, οἷον τὴν γραφικὴν ἢ τὴν πλαστικήν, αὐτῶν δὲ τῶν φύσει συνεστώτων μὴ μᾶλλον ἀγαπῷμεν τὴν θεωρίαν, δυνάμενοί γε τὰς αἰτίας καθορᾶν. διὸ δεῖ μὴ δυσχεραίνειν παιδικῶς τὴν περὶ τῶν ἀτιμοτέρων ζῴων ἐπίσκεψιν</foreign>.] </p>

The compensation principle, the debtor and creditor account between the two parties, belongs to justice, and has nothing to do with this natural affection, <foreign lang="greek">φιλία. δόξειε δ’  ἂν φυσικώτερον εἶναι τὸ αἴτιον, καὶ οὐχ ὅμοιον τῷ περὶ τοὺς δανείσαντας</foreign>, 1167 <hi rend="italic">b</hi> 29: and then follows the true explanation, <foreign lang="greek">ὅπερ καὶ ἐπὶ τῶν τεχνιτῶν συμβέβηκεν· πᾶς γὰρ τὸ οἰκεῖον ἔργον ἀγαπᾷ μᾶλλον ἢ ἀγαπηθείη ἂν ὑπὸ τοῦ ἔργου ἐμψύχου γενομένου. μάλιστα δ’  ἴσως τοῦτο περὶ τοὺς ποιητὰς συμβαίνει· ὑπεραγαπῶσι γὰρ οὗτοι τὰ οἰκεῖα ποιήματα, στέργοντες ὥσπερ τέκνα</foreign>. </p>
						<p>It is this love which men feel for what is specially their own in word <pb n="222"/> or work that is the foundation of their liking for flattery, for the love of others, and for honour, the external tokens of respect&mdash;all of which are recognitions of their merit in word or deed in some shape or other, and evidence of respect, admiration, and regard; from the flatterer a mere pretence, with the others a reality. It is also the explanation of the parental affection, children being in a special and peculiar sense a man's own work. </p>
						<p>And this accounts also for the pleasure which we find in supplying a defect, or bringing anything to a state of perfection (see on &sect; 22), &lsquo;because <hi rend="italic">now</hi> (by this time, not before, <foreign lang="greek">ἤδη</foreign>) the work becomes our own&rsquo;: the <hi rend="italic">perfection</hi> of it is due to ourselves, and we get the credit of the whole. Victorius remarks upon this, that the difference between this form of pleasure and that which is expressed in the same words in &sect; 22, lies in the difference of the source of the pleasure and the motive of the action in either case. In the former the motive is benevolent, and the pleasure is that of doing good to others; here the motive is selfish, and the pleasure that of gratifying oneself. </p>

						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ἐπεὶ τὸ ἄρχειν ἥδιστον</lemma>] &lsquo;ut res plana certaque ponitur&rsquo;. Victorius. However, it may most readily be deduced from the innate love of power, already indicated in &sect;&sect; 14, 22, <hi rend="italic">q. v.</hi> To this natural impulse or emotion is traced the pleasure that is derived from &lsquo;wisdom&rsquo;, or the reputation of it&mdash;this is not the same as the pleasure of learning or acquiring knowledge, but that of possessing and exercising it, or the influence which the reputation of it carries with it&mdash;Now &lsquo;wisdom&rsquo; may be understood in two senses; &lsquo;practical wisdom&rsquo;, <foreign lang="greek">φρόνησις, τὸ φρονεῖν</foreign>, which is pleasant to possess and exercise because it implies power, in the shape of influence over the actions of others; and &lsquo;speculative wisdom&rsquo;, <foreign lang="greek">σοφία</foreign>, which gratifies our love of wonder, &sect; 21, because it brings with it the knowledge of all sorts of things that are interesting and curious (and therefore objects of wonder). One would have supposed that the love of taxing, censuring, or finding fault with our neighbours and friends, <foreign lang="greek">ἐπιτιμᾷν</foreign>, is <hi rend="italic">directly</hi> traceable to the pleasure of exercising power so frequently noticed before. Here however an intermediate step is introduced between the feeling and its real origin. This is the love of honour. Censuring and finding fault implies an advantageous contrast between ourselves and those whom we thus &lsquo;tax&rsquo;, a superiority in judgment or virtue, which gives us the right to <pb n="223"/> find fault; and the honour we all love is reflected upon ourselves by the contrast. But the pleasure lies ultimately not in the honour itself, but in the superiority that respect and the outward signs of it indicate. </p>
						<p>MS A^{c} here adds <foreign lang="greek">καὶ τὸ ἄρχειν</foreign> after <foreign lang="greek">ἡδὺ εἶναι</foreign>, adopted by Spengel. It would mean of course the general exercise of authority, an extension of the special <foreign lang="greek">ἐπιτιμᾷν</foreign>, and analogous to it, as manifested in various modes of punishment or correction by word and deed. And herein would lie the distinction. The private citizen can only find fault (viz. with his tongue); the ruler can inflict actual penalties, personal or pecuniary. </p>

						<p>There is pleasure again in &lsquo;dwelling upon&rsquo;, lingering in (passing one's time in, <foreign lang="greek">διατρίβειν</foreign>) any pursuit or occupation in which one is &lsquo;at one's very best&rsquo;. <foreign lang="greek">διατρίβειν</foreign> is by a similar metaphor applied to dwelling on, brooding over, nursing, the prospect of vengeance, II 2. 2. This same topic is also applied to &lsquo;good&rsquo;, I 6. 29; the difference being in the &lsquo;ends&rsquo; or motives severally proposed, which stimulate the action in each; in the one it is success, a form of good; in the other, pleasure; the skill or degree of excellence shewn in the exercise of any faculty, bodily or mental, is the same in both. To dwell on that in which our superiority is shewn is of course pleasant, by the preceding rule. Problem XVIII 6, quoted by Gaisford, raises the question suggested by this topic. The solution which corresponds to the explanation here given, is the second: <foreign lang="greek">ἢ ὅτι ἐν οἷς οἴεται ἕκαστος κρατιστεύειν ταῦτα προαιρεῖται, ὃ δὲ αἱρεῖται καὶ ἐπὶ τοῦτ’  ἐπείξεται</foreign> (here follows the quotation from Euripides; and it is added,) <foreign lang="greek">ὅτι δ’  ἄν τινες ἐξ ἀρχῆς ἕλωνται, κἀν οἷς ἂν συνεθισθῶσιν, οὐδὲ κρίνειν δύνανται τὰ βελτίω· διέφθαρται γὰρ ἡ διάνοια διὰ φαύλας προαιρέσεις</foreign>: that is, men in these cases choose a lower kind of pursuit instead of a higher, in consequence of a depravation of judgment arising from the familiarity created by constant exercise of those practices in which their special skill lies. </p>

						<p>This fragment of Euripides' Antiope (Fr. XX Dind., XXVII Wagner) is quoted also in Plato's Gorgias 484 E, &amp;c., with one or two trifling variations.

						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">εἰρήσθω</lemma>] This is the first instance in the Rhetoric of the use of this most familiar Aristotelian form of expression (a verb in the third person of the imperative passive), which in some of his works occurs sometimes at the end of nearly every chapter. It expresses the completeness and sufficiency of any action or process, that a thing has been completely gone through and finished, and that that is sufficient, and no more need be said or done about it. Thus <foreign lang="greek">εἰρήσθω</foreign>, &lsquo;let so much <hi rend="italic">have been said</hi> upon the subject&rsquo;, means, let it suffice to have said so much, let this be considered sufficient, and the subject closed; and let us now &lsquo;have done with it&rsquo;, and go on to something else. It is not peculiar to Aristotle, though very much more common in him than in other writers. It occurs <pb n="225"/> for instance in Xenophon, Mem. IV 2. 19, <foreign lang="greek">ὅμως δὲ εἰρήσθω μοι</foreign>, &lsquo;be satisfied with my saying so much&rsquo;, let it suffice to have said so much: Plato, Phileb. 57 C, <foreign lang="greek">εἰρήσθω</foreign>, &lsquo;let it be said once for all&rsquo;, and no more about it. Ib. 62 E, <foreign lang="greek">μεθείσθων</foreign>, and Stallbaum's note on Phaedr. 278 B, <foreign lang="greek">πεπαίσθω</foreign>, &lsquo;enough of this joking&rsquo;, Ib. 250 C, <foreign lang="greek">κεχαρίσθω</foreign>, Theaet. 197 D, <foreign lang="greek">πεποιήσθω</foreign>, Euthyd. 278 D, <foreign lang="greek">πεπαίσθω ὑμῖν</foreign>, Rep. VIII 553 A, 562 A, IX 588 D, <foreign lang="greek">πεπλάσθω</foreign>. Thucyd. I 71, <foreign lang="greek">ὡρίσθω</foreign>, &lsquo;let this definition suffice&rsquo;. Ar. Eth. Nic. I 1 ult. <foreign lang="greek">πεφροιμιάσθω</foreign>, &lsquo;let so much suffice by way of preface&rsquo;; Top. A 8, 103 <hi rend="italic">b</hi> 1, and 13, 105 <hi rend="italic">a</hi> 21, <foreign lang="greek">διωρίσθω</foreign>: <hi rend="italic">et passim.</hi> </p>
						<p>This notion of a completed, perfected, concluded, fixed and permanent, and sufficient action, belongs to the perfect tense in general, and appears, not only in the imperative of the passive, but also in the indicative, perfect and future (the <hi rend="italic">paulo post futurum</hi>, on which see Matth. <hi rend="italic">Gr. Gr.</hi> &sect; 498). Of the indicative, instances are, Soph. Trach. 586, <foreign lang="greek">μεμηχάνηται τοὔργον</foreign>, Philoct. 1280, <foreign lang="greek">πέπαυμαι</foreign>, Eur. Hippol. 1457, <foreign lang="greek">κεκαρτέρηται τἀμά</foreign>, my powers of endurance are exhausted, the play is played out, all my endurance and sufferings are over, and this is the end: compare <foreign lang="greek">πεπόνθασι γάρ</foreign>, Rhet. II 8. 2; Aesch. Eum. 680, and Aesch. S. c. T. 1050, <foreign lang="greek">διατετίμηται</foreign> (Paley's notes on both passages). Fragm. Phryx (Fr. Aesch. 263), <foreign lang="greek">διαπεφρούρηται βίος</foreign>. Eur. Orest. 1203, and Phoen. 1019, <foreign lang="greek">εἴρηται λόγος</foreign>. Plat. Phileb. 62 D, <foreign lang="greek">μεθεῖνται</foreign>. Ar. Rhet. I 14 ult. II 5 ult. <foreign lang="greek">καὶ περὶ μὲν φοβερῶν καὶ θαρραλέων εἴρηται</foreign>, &lsquo;so much for&rsquo;, where the perf. ind. pass. in summing up at the end of the chapter, plainly differs only in form from the ordinary imperative. <hi rend="italic">Troia fuit. Fuit Ilium.</hi> </p>
						<p>Of the <hi rend="italic">paulo post futurum</hi> a good instance occurs Theaet. 180 A, in the humorous description of the Heraclitean philosophers, &lsquo;and if you look for an explanation of the meaning of the meaning of this, <foreign lang="greek">ἑτέρῳ πεπλήξει καινῶς μετωνομασμένῳ</foreign>, you will be instantly shot with (<hi rend="italic">lit.</hi> another phraselet, <foreign lang="greek">ῥηματίῳ</foreign>) another brand new word coined for the occasion&rsquo;, i. e. you will have been shot already, as it were; almost before you know where you are. </p>
						<p>The observation on this use of the tense in Jelf's <hi rend="italic">Gr. Gr.</hi> &sect; 399, obs. 1, is quite inadequate, and not quite correct: Matthiae, <hi rend="italic">Gr. Gr.</hi> &sect; 500, p. 841, is somewhat more satisfactory. </p>

						<p>First of all, the &lsquo;possibility&rsquo; of effecting it must always be taken into account by any one who contemplates the perpetration of a wrong: and not only the <hi rend="italic">general</hi> possibility, as whether so and so is possible to a human being (physical or absolute possibility), but a <hi rend="italic">special</hi> possibility to <pb n="226"/> themselves, <foreign lang="greek">καὶ ἑαυτοῖς δυνατόν</foreign>; in other words, the <hi rend="italic">moral</hi> possibility, when the act is done in such a way or under such circumstances as shall render it worth their while; such that the prejudice or injury sustained by the action or its consequences shall not outweigh the prospective benefit; an act done in spite of these considerations may be regarded as morally &lsquo;impossible&rsquo;. </p>

						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ἐν τοῖς ὕστερον</lemma>] The subject of &lsquo;general probability and improbability&rsquo; shall be considered hereafter, that is, in II 19, where the <foreign lang="greek">δυνατόν</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">ἀδύνατον</foreign> (one of the four <foreign lang="greek">κοινοὶ τόποι</foreign>) are analysed. This is expressed by the <foreign lang="greek">κοινὰ γὰρ ταῦτα πάντων τῶν λόγων</foreign> of the parenthesis: &lsquo;because they <hi rend="italic">are</hi> common to all kinds of speeches&rsquo;, (viz. the three kinds of Rhetoric, which is here taken as the basis of their <foreign lang="greek">κοινότης</foreign>, elsewhere it is their opposition to the <foreign lang="greek">εἴδη</foreign>, see Introd. on <foreign lang="greek">τόποι</foreign>, p. 128), &lsquo;<hi rend="italic">therefore</hi> they shall be considered hereafter&rsquo;, viz. with the rest in II 19.

						<p>The first class of persons that rely on this kind of possibility, in the sense of a possible exemption from punishment if they do wrong, are able speakers and men of action&mdash;the one capable of defending themselves against attack with their tongues by plausible argument, the other of carrying through the business or transaction in the best and completest way, so as to secure all possible advantage; and men already practised in many forensic contests&mdash;and so with acquired experience of the resources available for defence against an accuser in a court of justice; and men with many friends, having an extensive or influential connexion, or well befriended,&mdash;these will be well helped; and the wealthy&mdash;who can buy off an accuser or antagonist, and corrupt the judges. </p>

						<p>Again, the possibility is increased, the attempt becomes easier, if they are friends either of the objects of the wrong, those whom they propose to injure, or of the judges who would have to try the case if brought before them: for friends are off their guard (<hi rend="italic">lit.</hi> unguarded), and thereby particularly exposed to injury and wrong, and moreover are inclined to come to terms or to be reconciled without &lsquo;prosecuting&rsquo; the case, or bringing it before a court of justice; and judges are ready to oblige their friends, and either let them off altogether, or inflict a very slight penalty (so fair and upright were the Athenian dicasts). </p>
						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">οἱ...φίλοι ἀφύλακτοι κ.τ.λ.</lemma>] This sounds very atrocious, and certainly has a highly immoral appearance on the face of it.

Hence Thucydides applies it, III 15, to want of strength of will, or of inclination, <foreign lang="greek">ἀῤῥωστία τοῦ στρατεύειν</foreign>; and VII 47, to weakness of mind; the mental prostration or despondency which prevailed amongst the Athenian troops before Syracuse: and again in VIII 83, to Tissaphernes' weakness of will or inclination, as shewn in his &lsquo;remissness&rsquo; or &lsquo;disinclination&rsquo; to supply pay to the crews of the Peloponnesian vessels; which Arnold well expresses by &lsquo;he was sick of it&rsquo;. In Plat. Rep. II 359 B it represents nothing more than the defect or weakness of a faculty. In Xenophon the three words usually denote some form of disease or sickness: Demosth. Ol.

In Plat. Phileb. 16 A, it has a nearly similar sense, <foreign lang="greek">εἴ τις τρόπος ἔστιν καὶ μηχανή</foreign>. Lastly, confining <foreign lang="greek">διάθεσις</foreign> to the same subject, he translates it <hi rend="italic">vendere</hi>, as we say to <hi rend="italic">dispose of</hi> a thing; adding, <foreign lang="greek">διάθεσιν</foreign> <hi rend="italic">enim hic alienationem valere arbitror</hi>, and quoting, in support of the interpretation, Plut. Solon, p. 91 E, <foreign lang="greek">τῶν δὲ γενομένων διάθεσιν πρὸς ξένους ἐλαίου μόνον ἔδωκεν· ἄλλα δὲ ἐξάγειν ἐκώλυσεν</foreign>. Demosth. Olynth.

						<p>It seems to me preferable to extend the meaning, as in the other cases, beyond the mere &lsquo;disposal&rsquo; of stolen goods, to <hi rend="italic">any</hi> disposition or habit of mind, which is at all events the usual meaning of <foreign lang="greek">διάθεσις</foreign>. And there is this further reason for rejecting Victorius' limitation of the topic, that if it is adopted no difference whatsoever is left between <foreign lang="greek">κρύψις</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">τόπος</foreign> here and afterwards in &sect;&sect; 33, 34. </p>

						<p>&lsquo;And the reverse; where the (legal) crime tends to any kind of praise (is directed to, as its meed or reward; i. e. where what is a crime in <hi rend="italic">one</hi> point of view, is likely to meet with <hi rend="italic">praise</hi> in another), as, for instance, if the crime was accompanied by vengeance for father or mother, as it was in Zeno's case; whilst the penalties are all directed against a man's purse or person, as fine, imprisonment, banishment, or anything else of the same kind (not affecting his character or reputation): for both circumstances and both dispositions may be motives to wrong acts, only not in the same persons and the same characters&rsquo;. </p>
						<p>Men of different characters are influenced by different motives in the commission of crime. Some care more for honour and glory and reputation than for their money and personal ease and comfort, and these, like Zeno, will be ready to commit what may be construed as a crime and render them liable to punishment, provided it be attended with something which leads to praise: the others, who value their personal wellbeing more than their good name, will be induced rather to do wrong acts which lead to substantial gain, and affect only their reputation. The one are virtuous, though they err; the others, sordid, mean, and vicious. </p>
						<p>Of Zeno's case, here referred to, nothing is known, and we are reduced to conjecture. Of the two best known of this name, Zeno of Citium, the founder of the Stoic sect, whose death is placed in B. C. 263 (Clint. <hi rend="italic">Fast. Hell.</hi>), would, if alive, have been too young when Aristotle wrote the Rhetoric to have attracted public attention: it is just possible that the other, Zeno the logician, of Elea, Parmenides' follower, may be the person <pb n="232"/> here meant. Of this Zeno we learn from Plutarch, Diogenes Laertius, and Diodorus (see the reff. in Brandis' Art. in Smith's <hi rend="italic">Dict. Biogr.</hi>) that he joined in an attempt to rid his native country of her tyrant: and if the attempt was successful (of which we are not informed) and the tyrant slain, Zeno may <hi rend="italic">possibly</hi> have mixed personal considerations with his public and patriotic motives, just as Harmodius and Aristogeiton did, as Aristotle tells us in the Politics (VIII (V) 10), in their attack upon the Athenian tyrant. Only it seems unlikely that if this were the true explanation of the allusion that Aristotle would have spoken of tyrannicide as an <foreign lang="greek">ἀδίκημα</foreign>, a &lsquo;wrong&rsquo;, either legal or moral: and besides this, the act itself, as well as the attendant circumstance, would have been regarded as praiseworthy. </p>

See also Stallbaum's note on Gorgias 521 B, who quotes Olympiodorus (on the passage of Plato), <foreign lang="greek">ἡ παροιμία αὕτη ἐκ τοῦ Τηλέφου ἐστὶν Εὐριπίδου, ἐκεῖ γάρ κ.τ.λ.</foreign> Whatever may be the origin of this proverb, it certainly was not <hi rend="italic">derived</hi> from Euripides' play: for Harpocration expressly says that it is to be found in Strattis (the Comic poet) and Simonides <foreign lang="greek">ἐν ἰάμβοις</foreign>.

						<p>The above explanations seem to be founded upon the <hi rend="italic">helpless condition</hi> of the Mysian people under some special circumstances which deprived them of their ordinary means of self-defence.

This imputation of cowardice or weakness is directly conveyed by Aristotle in the passage before us. This brings the two proverbs together as the expression of the same features of national character. This will furnish a sufficient explanation of Gorg. 521 B, <foreign lang="greek">εἰ σοι Μυσόν γε ἥδιον καλεῖν</foreign>, and we need not have recourse with Stallbaum and Heindorf (ad loc. &sect; 162) to the <foreign lang="greek">Μυσῶν λείαν</foreign> to interpret it.

Callippus was an Athenian, friend and companion of Dion during his stay at Athens, and the partner of his expedition to Sicily for the liberation of his native country. By his conduct and services he had ingratiated himself with Dion's mercenaries, whom he incited to murder their general, and thereby made himself master of Syracuse. Before this, he had spread calumnious reports about Dion and excited the citizens against him. Dion being informed of this took no precautions for his own safety; partly in scorn of the attempt, and partly because he was unwilling to preserve his own power and life at the expense of the destruction of his friends: the scheme accordingly took effect, and Dion was shortly after put to death. Aristotle says upon this that Callippus justified the act by arguing that as Dion had now knowledge of his designs, and his own life <pb n="242"/> was in danger, this anticipation of the other, was a mere measure of precaution or retaliation, and no crime at all. This suspicion of Callippus is the ground of his <hi rend="italic">complaint</hi> and the occasion of the <hi rend="italic">previous difference</hi>, or sundering of their apparent friendship.

That this is a sort of justification of such an act appears in the conduct attributed to &AElig;nesidemus towards Gelo: the latter (tyrant of Syracuse) had anticipated him (the tyrant of Leontini) in reducing and enslaving some state that was neighbour of both: Aenesidemus sends a present to Gelo of eggs, cakes, and sweetmeats, the ordinary prize of the game of <foreign lang="greek">κότταβος</foreign>, as a prize, in acknowledgment of his superior foresight, quickness and dexterity, shewn in his &lsquo;anticipation&rsquo; of himself, <foreign lang="greek">ὅτι ἔφθασεν</foreign>, admitting at the same time that he had had an eye to it himself. This shows that Aenesidemus thought it &lsquo;hardly a crime&rsquo;, <foreign lang="greek">ἐγγὺς τοῦ μὴ ἀδικεῖν</foreign>, a justifiable act; and also illustrates the extreme liability to aggression and wrong involved in the position of this &lsquo;neighbouring state&rsquo;, which would have been wronged in any case by some one else, <foreign lang="greek">ὑπ’  ἄλλων μέλλοντας</foreign>, at any rate, even if Gelo (who here represents the <foreign lang="greek">αὐτοί</foreign>, the man who takes the initiative) had not done it himself. </p>

In Pindar his name occurs three times, but only as the father of Thero, Ol. II 46, III 9, and of him and Xenocrates, Isthm. II 41. To reconcile Herodotus' statement about him with that of Aristotle here, we may perhaps suppose that Aenesidemus had made himself master of Agrigentum, on the throne of which he was succeeded by his son Thero, before the period to which this story belongs. Aristotle's narrative certainly represents him as a sovereign prince, and not as a mere mercenary in another's service.

This topic may be further illustrated by Bassanio's appeal to the judge, <hi rend="italic">Merchant of Venice</hi>, Act IV. Sc. 1, line 209, <hi rend="italic">And I beseech you, Wrest once the law to your authority: To do a great right do a little wrong, And curb this cruel devil of his will.</hi> </p>

						<p>Victorius observes that we here enter upon a new division of the chapter. The analysis has been hitherto confined to <hi rend="italic">persons</hi> prone to wrong and liable to wrong: it is now applied to certain classes of <hi rend="italic">things</hi> or circumstances which increase the liability to wrong. These are kinds of <foreign lang="greek">ἀδικήματα</foreign>. It is in fact a transition to the subject of the next chapter. Such are offences of very common occurrence; men are tempted to commit such because they think they shall meet with indulgence: people have become so familiar with the offence by constant association (<foreign lang="greek">συνηθείᾳ</foreign>) that it has lost its repulsive character; and also they may argue that if &lsquo;all or many&rsquo; are guilty of it, it must be a human infirmity, and being a <hi rend="italic">natural</hi> defect is hardly to be called a vice. <pb n="244"/> </p>

						<p>Crimes and the products of them that are easy to conceal, especially in the case of stealing, which is here most prominent in the author's thoughts. Such are things that are soon consumed, as eatables, or things that can be easily changed (in their appearance, without losing their value; so that they shall not be recognized, and the theft escape detection), in respect of their shape (as plate and coin by melting), or colour (cloth or silk by dyeing), or mixture (as liquids of all kinds). Victorius refers to Cic. de Fin. V 25. 74, of the Stoics, <hi rend="italic">Atque ut reliqui fures earum rerum quas ceperunt signa commutant, sic illi ut sententiis nostris</hi> (sc. Academicorum) <hi rend="italic">pro suis uterentur nomina tanquam rerum notas mutaverunt.</hi> There is about the same amount of resemblance in this topic to that of &sect; 8, as we found in &sect; 28 (<hi rend="italic">q. v.</hi>) to that of &sect; 14; the circumstance is nearly the same, the application different. </p>

						<p>The chapter concludes with a summary enumeration of its contents. &lsquo;So now of the characters and dispositions that incline men to crime, the several kinds of those crimes, the characters that invite crime, and the motives that incite to crime, we have given a tolerably complete (<foreign lang="greek">σχεδόν</foreign>) account&rsquo;, or analysis. </p>

					<p>A connected sketch of the contents of the following chapter, a particular account of <foreign lang="greek">ἐπιείκεια</foreign> or equity, and of the relations of the different kinds of &lsquo;law&rsquo;, will be found in the Introduction, p. 187&mdash;193, and on p. 239 (Appendix E to chap.

					<p>It analyses and classifies actions right and wrong, first from the <hi rend="italic">strictly legal</hi>, and secondly from the <hi rend="italic">equitable</hi> or moral point of view. Equity is the principle of merciful consideration, that indulgent view of men's actions which makes allowance for human infirmities, looks rather to the intention than the act, and thus mitigates or corrects (<foreign lang="greek">ἐπανορθοῖ</foreign>) the strict rigour of the &lsquo;written law&rsquo;. </p>

						<p>&lsquo;In distinguishing or analysing wrong and right acts, let us commence with the following consideration&rsquo; (or, let us take the following for our starting-point).

						<p>&lsquo;I distinguish therefore two kinds of law, the special and the universal; and by special, I mean that which is determined in each people or nation (separately or individually) by themselves, (<hi rend="italic">lit.</hi> that which has for each class of people or nation its definition directed or referred to themselves,) by their own peculiar habits, customs, feelings, opinions, form of government, and this either unwritten or written&rsquo; (see <pb n="246"/> in explanation of this, Introd. Appendix E p. 242&mdash;244); &lsquo;and by universal law, the &ldquo;law of Nature&rdquo;.&rsquo; For there is, as all are instinctively convinced, a natural and universal notion of right and wrong, quite independent of any mutual communication (association, intercourse), or compact, such as Sophocles' Antigone evidently alludes to, when she says that it is just, (right), though forbidden, (by the <hi rend="italic">positive</hi> law of Creon's enactment) to bury Polynices, implying (<foreign lang="greek">ὡς</foreign>, on the supposition that) that this is naturally right. </p>

In illustration of the doctrine alluded to in the lines quoted, Karsten cites Diogenes Laertius, de Pythag. VIII 13, <hi rend="italic">qui dicit, eum vetare</hi> <foreign lang="greek">ἅπτεσθαι τῶν ζῴων, κοινὸν δίκαιον ἡμῖν ἐχόντων τῆς ψυχῆς</foreign>; and Sextus Empiricus adv. Math.

The verse cited by Karsten in support of his interpretation of <foreign lang="greek">αὐγῆς</foreign> seems insufficient for its purpose; the word there seems to have no other meaning than its ordinary one, &lsquo;sunbeam or sunlight&rsquo;; I doubt if <foreign lang="greek">αὐγή</foreign> could stand for &lsquo;heaven&rsquo;; and perhaps it may be better to accept Bekker's reading. </p>

						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">πρὸς οὓς δὲ διώρισται, διχῶς διώρισται</lemma>, Vulg.&mdash;<foreign lang="greek">δίχα ὥρισται</foreign> A^{c}, adopted by Bekker and Spengel [ed. 1867], omitting the first <foreign lang="greek">διώρισται</foreign>: in <hi rend="italic">Rhetores Graeci</hi> [1853] he reads [<foreign lang="greek">διώρισται] διχῶς διώρισται</foreign>, in conformity with &sect; 1. (I do not myself see why the first <foreign lang="greek">διώρισται</foreign> need be omitted without manuscript authority.) &lsquo;In respect of the persons to whom it is referred, this division of law is twofold, for the right and wrong, justice and injustice, in acts, are referred to (severally determined by, divided in relation to) either the public, society in general, the whole community (against whom the offence is supposed to be directed), or an individual member of it. And therefore just and unjust acts are divided into two classes, according as they are directed against a single and definite individual, or the community at large. Adultery and assault are injuries or wrongs to the indi<pb n="248"/> viduals, refusal to serve, or desertion, is a wrong to the entire community or nation&rsquo;. This is the basis of the distinction in Attic jurisprudence between the <foreign lang="greek">δίκη</foreign>, the private civil action or suit of man against man, and the <foreign lang="greek">γραφή</foreign>, or public, criminal prosecution; since the latter is a state offence, common to the whole community, a public prosecution may be conducted by <foreign lang="greek">ὁ βουλόμενος</foreign>, &lsquo;any one that pleases&rsquo;, provided, that is, he be a qualified Athenian citizen. See further on this subject, in Introd. I 13, p. 187, and Meier u. Sch&ouml;mann, <hi rend="italic">Der Attische Process</hi>, Bk. III. &sect; 2. Buttmann ad Dem. Med. &sect; 9. </p>
						<p>Accordingly <foreign lang="greek">ὁ τύπτων</foreign> is liable to a <foreign lang="greek">δίκη αἰκίας; ὁ μὴ στρατευόμενος</foreign>, one that either declines to serve altogether, and so fails in his duty to society and his country, or a deserter, to a <foreign lang="greek">γραφὴ ἀστρατείας</foreign> or <foreign lang="greek">λειποταξίου. μοιχεία</foreign> is here included with <foreign lang="greek">αἰκία</foreign> in the class of wrongs that are the subject of a <foreign lang="greek">δίκη</foreign> or <foreign lang="greek">δίκη ἰδία</foreign>; under the ordinary classification it exposed the offender to a <foreign lang="greek">γραφή</foreign>, a criminal prosecution, which, as it could be carried on by the husband or one of the near relations, might also properly be called <foreign lang="greek">ἰδία</foreign>. Meier u. Sch&ouml;mann, u. s., p. 163&mdash;4, 327 seq. In this case the state, as well as the husband, considered itself aggrieved as the guardian of public morals. In illustration of this twofold aspect of a crime, Victorius quotes Cic. in Verrem, V (III) 69, 161, <hi rend="italic">quibus in rebus. non solum filio, Verres, sed etiam reipublicae fecisti iniuriam: susceperas enim liberos non solum tibi sed etiam patriae.</hi> </p>

						<p>&lsquo;After this division, or classification, of wrong acts, some of which are directed against the entire community, and the others against one or more <hi rend="italic">individuals</hi>, let us first repeat our definition of <foreign lang="greek">τὸ ἀδικεῖσθαι</foreign>, that we may know what being treated unjustly, or suffering wrong, is, and then proceed to the rest&rsquo;. </p>
						<p>The introduction of <foreign lang="greek">ἄλλους</foreign> here leads to a new distinction: a civil action between parties in their private capacity may be brought either against one or several, as when an action is brought against a club or commercial company or the partners in a firm: in either case the offence which is the subject of it is private and particular, and directed against individuals, and both of them are distinguished from state offences. </p>
						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ἀναλαβόντες</lemma>] to repeat or resume (take up again) seems to be a reference to I 10. 3, where <foreign lang="greek">ἀδικεῖν</foreign>, the exact opposite of <foreign lang="greek">ἀδικεῖσθυι</foreign>, was defined, <pb n="249"/> and the latter can readily be inferred from the former. This may be called a resumption, or, in a sense, a repetition of the preceding definition, or at all events of the same subject; and this seems to be confirmed by the reference, in the next sentence, to this very definition. On the entire question of the voluntary character of <foreign lang="greek">ἀδίκημα</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">ἀδικία</foreign> see Eth. Nic. V 11 (Bekk.): and that of vice in general is discussed in the same work, III 7 (Bekk.). The conclusion in the two chapters of the Ethics is that which is here assumed to be the fact. </p>

						<p>&lsquo;To be wronged then is to be unjustly treated by a voluntary agent, for to do wrong has been previously defined to be voluntary&rsquo;, I 10. 3. And since &lsquo;doing&rsquo; and &lsquo;suffering&rsquo;, action and passion, are opposites, and opposites fall under the same <foreign lang="greek">γένος</foreign>, we may infer at once that if doing wrong is voluntary, suffering wrong is voluntary too&mdash;not in the patient of course, but in the agent.

						<p>The distinction of the <foreign lang="greek">ἐπίγραμμα</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">περὶ ο τὸ ἐπίγραμμα</foreign> I have already indicated. The one is the <foreign lang="greek">στάσις ὁρική</foreign>, the <hi rend="italic">name or title</hi> by which the act should be designated, which determines the court that it shall be tried in, and is represented in all the examples given except the case of trespass: the other is the <hi rend="italic">description given of the act</hi>, as may be seen in the instance that illustrates it, the <hi rend="italic">trespass</hi> (the <hi rend="italic">name</hi>) is acknowledged, but the detailed account described it as a trespass upon the <hi rend="italic">public</hi> land, which is denied. This, if it corresponds to any of the <foreign lang="greek">στάσεις</foreign> when they were regularly classified (on which see Introd. p. 397 seq. in Appendix E to Book III), must be the <foreign lang="greek">στάσις</foreign> of quality, <foreign lang="greek">ποιότης</foreign>, <hi rend="italic">quale:</hi> but it seems certain that in Aristotle's time they had not yet been systematised and arranged under constant technical names. At all events, in this passage in the two last cases it seems that no very clear distinction is made out; or apparently intended, as appears from the mixing up together of the examples of both. Quint. III 6.49, where Aristotle's division of <foreign lang="greek">στάσεις</foreign> is noticed, must be referred, not to this passage, but to Rhet. III 16.6, and 17. 1. </p>

						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ἐπεργάσασθαι</lemma>] Donaldson, <hi rend="italic">New Cratylus</hi> &sect; 174, has introduced this passage amongst his examples of a large family of verbs compounded with <foreign lang="greek">ἐπί</foreign>, in which the preposition corresponds to the Latin (and English) <hi rend="italic">inter</hi> (in composition), implying <hi rend="italic">reciprocity</hi>, or mutual right or association, as <foreign lang="greek">ἐπικοινωνία</foreign>, <hi rend="italic">inter</hi>-communion, <foreign lang="greek">ἐπιγαμία</foreign>, the right of <hi rend="italic">inter</hi>-marriage, Rhet. I 14. 5. It is quite true that <foreign lang="greek">ἐπεργασία</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">ἐπεργάζεσθαι</foreign> (see the examples in Donaldson, p. 296, and the Lexicons) are both used in this sense <pb n="252"/> for the right of inter-cultivation of land, just like <foreign lang="greek">ἐπινομία</foreign> the right of mutual pasturage, as on a border territory. But here <foreign lang="greek">ἐπεργάσασθαι</foreign> must mean to encroach or trespass, otherwise it is no offence: and so the word is used by Aeschines, Ctesiph. &sect; 113, of the Locrians of Amphissa who &lsquo;encroached upon&rsquo; the sacred soil of Crissa, by cultivating, Thucyd. I 139, and elsewhere; as well as <foreign lang="greek">ἐπινομία</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">ἐπινέμειν</foreign>, for a similar trespass on the pasturage of some one else. The primary sense must be no doubt that of reciprocal right or occupation, the interchange of cultivation. Perhaps the notion of going backwards and forwards over a border to cultivate land may have suggested the notion of trespassing, by extending the original signification to cases where there was no such right existing, or only in the trespasser's imagination. </p>

This however was <hi rend="italic">not</hi> &lsquo;said&rsquo; precisely as it is here; <hi rend="italic">there</hi>, laws were divided into universal and special, and then the special subdivided into written (or positive law) and unwritten: and we now learn that the universal law is also unwritten, and that the special branch of the unwritten law, which must now be distinguished from the other, is to be found in that spirit of fairness and mercy and consideration, which consists in an inclination to relax the unnecessary rigour of the written code arising from its own imperfections, and at the same time to make due allowance for human errors and infirmities: all which is contained in the principles of equity, the unwritten law which prescribes such a course of conduct in matters of doubt. I have observed in the Introduction p. 244 that we are probably to extend this subordinate kind of <foreign lang="greek">ἄγραφοι νόμοι</foreign> so as to include all the prevailing feelings and opinions as to propriety and right and wrong in general which prevail in each <hi rend="italic">special</hi> state (and are therefore a kind of <foreign lang="greek">ἴδιος νόμος</foreign>, distinguished from the universal): of which indeed the views and feelings represented by equity form a very considerable part. </p>
					</div3>
					<div3 id="b1c13s12" type="section" n="12">
						<p>The two kinds of unwritten law are, <hi rend="italic">first</hi> the universal law, the precepts of which suggest higher considerations and higher duties than mere legal obligations to pursue virtue and avoid vice (this is what is meant by the &lsquo;excess, or higher degree, of virtue and vice&rsquo; above the legal standard, expressed in <foreign lang="greek">καθ’  ὑπερβολὴν ἀρετῆς καὶ κακίας</foreign>, <hi rend="italic">quod eximiam virtutem aut vitium inde continet</hi>, Victorius), obedience to which law is rewarded by praise and honour and gifts (the two kinds of rewards; the &lsquo;gifts&rsquo; in this case being conferred of course not for their value as a pecuniary compensation, but in so far as they are signs of moral approbation) and the breach or violation of it punished by (not fine or imprisonment or any personal penalty, as the violation of a <hi rend="italic">legal</hi> enactment, but by) censure, reproach, dishonour (not deprivation of civil rights, which is a <hi rend="italic">legal</hi> penalty): of such precepts examples are, gratitude to benefactors, the return or repayment of obligations (differing from the <hi rend="italic">feeling</hi> of gratitude), <pb n="255"/> the inclination and readiness to aid and defend one's friends, and such like. It is remarkable that amongst the precepts of the universal law which we are all bound to obey Aristotle should have here omitted the duty of interring and paying honour to the dead, so strikingly exemplified by the appeal of Antigone against Creon's tyrannous proclamation in the play to which he himself had just called our attention (comp. Eur. Suppl. 16&mdash;19, 526, 538), and still more so perhaps in the trial of the eight generals after Arginusae. </p>
						<p>The <hi rend="italic">second</hi> kind of unwritten law is that which belongs to law special, and is what is omitted by (i. e. intended to supply the deficiencies of) the written law. </p>
						<p>Some of these universal principles of the popular morality are occasionally mentioned by the poets and other non-scientific writers: they are the most general rules of conduct which every one everywhere is supposed to recognise and obey. A short list of the most fundamental of them is given in the Rhet. ad Alex. c. I (2). 6, 7, which almost coincides with Aristotle's in the Rhetoric, <foreign lang="greek">δίκαιον μὲν ουν ἐστὶ τὸ τῶν ἁπάντων ἢ τὸ τῶν πλείστων ἔθος ἄγραφον, διορίζον τὰ καλὰ καὶ τὰ αἰσχρά. τοῦτο δ’  ἐστὶ τὸ γονέας τιμᾷν καὶ φίλους εὖ ποιεῖν καὶ τοῖς εὐεργέταις χάριν ἀποδιδόναι· ταῦτα γὰρ καὶ τὰ τούτοις ὅμοια οὐ προστάττουσι τοῖς ἀνθρώποις οἱ γεγραμμένοι νόμοι ποιεῖν, ἀλλ̓ εὐθὺς ἀγράφῳ καὶ κοινῷ νόμῳ νομίζεται</foreign>.

Memor. IV 4. 19&mdash;24, where the same are mentioned with one or two additions. On the unwritten law in general, see Plato, Legg. VII 793 A, B, C; he says <hi rend="italic">inter alia</hi>, <foreign lang="greek">οὓς πατρίους νόμους ἐπονομάζουσιν, δεσμοὶ οὗτοι πάσης εἰσὶ πολιτείας μεταξὺ πάντων ὄντες τῶν ἐν γράμμασι τεθέντων τε καὶ κειμένων καὶ τῶν ἔτι τεθησομένων, ἀτεχνῶς οἷον πάτρια καὶ παντάπασιν ἀρχαῖα νόμιμα, ἃ καλῶς μὲν τεθέντα καὶ ἐθισθέντα πάσῃ σωτηρίᾳ περικαλύψαντα ἔχει πρὸς τοὺς γραφέντας νόμους</foreign>, and he finally classes with the unwritten law the <foreign lang="greek">ἔθη καὶ ἐπιδεύματα</foreign>, Aristotle's second class of <foreign lang="greek">ἄγραφοι νόμοι</foreign>, as I have mentioned in p. 243 of the Introduction. </p>

						<p>&lsquo;This is done sometimes unintentionally, sometimes intentionally, on the part of the legislators, unintentionally when the omission escapes their notice, intentionally when they find it impossible to define or determine every thing (to provide by their definitions or determinations for all possible cases in detail), and are therefore obliged to lay down the rule as absolute (to pronounce universally), though it is not so in fact, but only true and fair for the most part&rsquo;; and so fail to provide for exceptional cases.

In Magna Moralia, II 1, the author, in treating of <foreign lang="greek">ἐπιείκεια</foreign>, says, <foreign lang="greek">ἃ γὰρ ὁ νομοθέτης ἐξαδυνατεῖ καθ’  ἕκαστα ἀκριβῶς διορίζειν, ἀλλὰ καθόλου λέγει, ὁ ἐν τούτοις παραχωρῶν, καὶ ταῦθ̓ αἱρούμενος ἃ ὁ νομοθέτης ἐβούλετο μὲν τῷ καθ̓ ἕκαστα διορίσαι, οὐκ ἠδυνήθη δέ, ὁ τοιοῦτος ἐπιεικής</foreign>, and concludes, <foreign lang="greek">τῶν μὲν γὰρ φύσει καὶ ὡς ἀληθῶς ὄντων δικαίων οὐκ ἐλαττοῦται, ἀλλὰ τῶν κατὰ νόμον, ἃ ὁ νομοθέτης ἐξαδυνατῶν ἀπέλιπεν</foreign>. On the defects of the written law, see also Rhet. I 1. 7. </p>
						<p>And not only is the legislator unable to provide for all exceptional cases to general rules, but also the infinity of particular circumstances which distinguish human actions and crimes precludes the possibility of his enumerating in detail all those varieties which in justice should have different degrees of punishment apportioned to them; as for instance, in enacting the prohibition of &lsquo;wounding with an iron instrument&rsquo;, to define the size and the kind of instrument in every case; for life is too short, and would fail a man in the attempt to reckon them all up in detail (on this case, which is given also by Quintilian, VII 6. 8, see Introd. p. 191). </p>

						<p>If then it be thus impossible to determine all these particular and exceptional cases, and yet there is a necessity for legislation, the law <hi rend="italic">must</hi> be expressed in general terms; so that if a man wearing an iron <pb n="257"/> ring lift his hand (to threaten) or strike another, by the <hi rend="italic">written</hi> law (the <hi rend="italic">letter</hi> of the law) he is liable (to the penalty), and has committed a crime, but in truth and in fact he is not guilty of a crime, and herein (<foreign lang="greek">τοῦτο</foreign>, in this fair interpretation of the act) lies equity&rsquo;. </p>

III 2, on involuntary ignorance) and mere misfortunes, <hi rend="italic">accidental</hi>, which should be carefully distinguished from actual crimes, and not visited with equal penalties: the latter of the two, accidental misfortunes, are such acts as are sudden and unexpected, or beyond calculation, and do not spring from a vicious habit or evil intention; errors are such as are not accidental, in the sense of unexpected and beyond calculation, and yet do not proceed from vice (in the same sense as before); but crimes are acts that are not without calculation (i.e. deliberate), and are prompted by a vicious habit or inclination, because all wrong acts that are due to desire, proceed from this depraved will and moral judgment&rsquo;. This is the usual classification of the degrees of criminality in actions; for acts, of which the mischievous consequences are purely accidental, and therefore altogether beyond our own control, and for mischievous acts committed under some mistake as to the particular circumstances of the case (not of general moral principles, for which we <hi rend="italic">are</hi> responsible), as when a man is killed with a gun that was not known to be loaded, we are <hi rend="italic">not</hi> responsible: what makes us responsible for an act is not only the harm or injury that is its consequence, but the deliberate intention or purpose with which it was done (and in all cases where the wrong was prompted by desire, this is sure to be an evil one, <foreign lang="greek">τὰ γὰρ δἰ ἐπιθυμίαν ἀπὸ πονηρίας</foreign>) and full knowledge of all the circumstances of the case. In the treatment of this subject in Eth. Nic. V 10, a fourth degree is introduced between the error and the crime. <pb n="258"/> This is the case of a wrong act, as a homicide, done in a fit of passion <foreign lang="greek">ὁ θυμῷ ποιῶν, ὁ ὀργίσας</foreign>: this being done by a spontaneous impulse, and not after deliberation with malice prepense (<foreign lang="greek">οὐκ ἐκ προνοίας</foreign>), is only an <foreign lang="greek">ἀδίκημα</foreign>, a wrong no doubt, and a thing which ought not to have been done, but not punishable like the deliberate act; a homicide not a murder. Compare the treatment of this topic in Rhet. ad Alex. 4 (5). 9&mdash;11. It seems to have been one of the stock topics of the rhetorical books. The degrees of criminality are there, as here, only three. </p>

					<p>This chapter, a continuation of the preceding, contains the application of the &lsquo;common topic&rsquo; of degree, &lsquo;greater and less&rsquo;, to the offences or crimes which formed the subject of the other. </p>
					<div3 id="b1c14s1" type="section" n="1">
						<p>&lsquo;The magnitude of a <hi rend="italic">wrong</hi> varies with the degree of the <hi rend="italic">injustice</hi> that prompts it&rsquo;. There is here the same distinction taken between <foreign lang="greek">ἀδίκημα</foreign>, a wrong done&mdash;an abstract wrong, regarded independently of the motive or intention&mdash;and the confirmed habit (the bad <foreign lang="greek">ἕξις</foreign>), depraved will and disposition implied in <foreign lang="greek">ἀδικία</foreign>. The deliberate purpose, <foreign lang="greek">προαίρεσις</foreign>, is the measure of moral worth, and distinguishes virtue from vice, Eth. Nic. V 10, 1135 <hi rend="italic">b</hi> 20, <foreign lang="greek">ὅταν δὲ εἰδὼς μὲν μὴ προβουλεύσας δὲ</foreign> (<foreign lang="greek">πράττῃ τις</foreign>), <foreign lang="greek">ἀδίκημα, οἷον ὅσα τε διὰ θυμὸν καὶ ἄλλα πάθη, ὅσα ἀναγκαῖα ἢ φυσικά, συμβαίνει τοῖς ἀνθρώποις· ταῦτα γὰρ βλάπτοντες καὶ ἁμαρτάνοντες ἀδικοῦσι μέν, καὶ ἀδικήματά ἐστιν, οὐ μέντοι πω ἄδικοι διὰ ταῦτα οὐδὲ πονηροί· οὐ γὰρ διὰ μοχθηρίαν ἡ βλάβη· ὅταν δ’  ἐκ προαιρέσεως, ἄδικος καὶ μοχθηρός</foreign>. </p>
						<p>&lsquo;And therefore (sometimes) the smallest things are greatest&rsquo;, acts apparently most trifling are sometimes indicative of the worst intentions and dispositions, &lsquo;as is exemplified in Callistratus' charge against Melanopus, that he cheated the temple-builders of three consecrated half-obols&rsquo;. Such a charge subjected the offender to a <foreign lang="greek">γραφὴ ἱερῶν χρημάτων</foreign>, Dem. de Fals. Leg. &sect; 335 [= p. 435 &sect; 293]. The exact nature of the offence imputed to Melanopus cannot be ascertained: it was probably some fraud (possibly an error construed as a crime,) in the settlement of accounts between himself and the persons charged with the building or restoration of a temple, the <foreign lang="greek">ναοποιοί</foreign>. </p>
						<p>The word <foreign lang="greek">ναοποιοί</foreign> appears to be an <foreign lang="greek">ἅπαξ λεγόμενον</foreign>. Stephens, <hi rend="italic">Thesaurus</hi> s. v., gives no other example. On the same analogy are formed <foreign lang="greek">τειχοποιός, μηχανοποιός, ἀγαλματοποιός</foreign>. The office is <hi rend="italic">described</hi> in Pol. VII (VI) 8, 1322 <hi rend="italic">b</hi> 19, <foreign lang="greek">οἷον ἱερεῖς καὶ ἐπιμεληταὶ τῶν περὶ τὰ ἱερὰ τοῦ σώζεσθαί τε τὰ ὑπάρχοντα καὶ ἀνορθοῦσθαι τὰ πίπτοντα τῶν οἰκοδομημάτων καὶ τῶν ἄλλων ὅσα τέτακται πρὸς τοὺς θεούς</foreign>. The word <foreign lang="greek">ἱεροποιοί</foreign>, which follows immediately, in line 24, is referred by Stahr (erroneously however) to this office of curator of sacred buildings, where he translates it &lsquo;<hi rend="italic">tempel-baumeister</hi>&rsquo;. </p>
						<p>The magnitude of the vice is argued in this case from the trifling amount of the profit; if a man would commit so great a sin as sacrilege for three halfpence, how great must be the depravity of his character and intentions. Melanopus and Callistratus, as Victorius notes, are mentioned together as ambassadors to Thebes by Xenoph., Hellen. VI 2 and 3; and by Plutarch, Vit. Demosth. (p. 851 F), represented as political rivals and opponents. On Callistratus, see note on I 7. 13. </p>
						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">παρελογίσατο</lemma>] This verb has two different applications in conformity with the <hi rend="italic">double</hi> sense of <foreign lang="greek">λογίζεσθαι</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">λογισμός</foreign>; the two senses, though closely connected and often identified, are at all events distinguishable; <pb n="261"/> (1) &lsquo;reasoning&rsquo; and (2) &lsquo;calculation&rsquo;; the <foreign lang="greek">παρά</foreign>, which conveys the imputation of <hi rend="italic">fraud</hi> (<foreign lang="greek">παρά</foreign>, amiss, awry, <hi rend="italic">wrong</hi>), being common to both. Here (as in Dem. c. Aphob. <foreign lang="greek">ά</foreign>, p. 822. 25, where it stands for simple &lsquo;misreckoning&rsquo;, and Isocr. Panath. &sect; 243, for &lsquo;cheating&rsquo;, &lsquo;<hi rend="italic">fraudulent</hi> miscalculation&rsquo; in accounts) it has the latter sense. Elsewhere, and <hi rend="italic">usually</hi>, (at all events in Aristotle, as Rhet. I 9. 29, II 23. 3, 25. 10 <hi rend="italic">bis</hi>, III 12. 4, <hi rend="italic">et passim</hi>,) it denotes &lsquo;wrong, fallacious, false, <hi rend="italic">reasoning</hi>&rsquo;, a &lsquo;fallacy&rsquo; in argument. Lastly <foreign lang="greek">ἱερά</foreign> means &lsquo;consecrated to sacred uses; devoted to the service of <hi rend="italic">the gods</hi> or <hi rend="italic">religion</hi>&rsquo;. </p>
						<p>&lsquo;In the case of justice, the opposite is true&rsquo;. That is, the magnitude or strength of the just and virtuous disposition, inclination, resolution, is shewn, not now in the trifling character of the temptation or motive by which it is led astray, but in the greatness of the temptation which it withstands. &lsquo;Ut qui ingentem vim auri, apud se nullo teste depositam, cum infitiari impune possit, reddidit, iustior sit necesse est quam si idem in exigua pecunia fecit.&rsquo; Victorius. Injustice varies inversely with the magnitude of the profit or advantage to be derived from it, the less the temptation the greater the sin; justice directly, the greater the profit and the consequent temptation to do wrong, the higher the virtue in foregoing it: as, the greater the deposit, the greater the justice in restoring it. </p>
						<p>&lsquo;The reason of this&rsquo; (<foreign lang="greek">ταῦτα</foreign> is <foreign lang="greek">τὸ τὰ ἐλάχιστα μέγιστα εἶναι</foreign>) &lsquo;is, that (the greater crime) is virtually latent (in the less); for one who could steal (<hi rend="italic">lit.</hi> stole) three half-obols consecrated to religious uses would be capable of any other iniquity whatsoever&rsquo;. The <foreign lang="greek">δύναμις</foreign>, the indefinite latent capacity of vice, is tacitly opposed to the <foreign lang="greek">ἐνέργεια</foreign>, any possible enormity, to which it may, or may not, be developed. If a man will commit a crime which may be interpreted as sacrilege for such a trifle as three half-obols, he is plainly &lsquo;capable&rsquo; of sacrilege in any degree of atrocity, where the profit and temptation are greater. </p>
						<p>On the subject of <foreign lang="greek">δύναμις</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">ἐνέργεια</foreign>, physical, moral, and metaphysical, the fundamental and all-pervading antithesis of the Aristotelian Philosophy, a commentary on Rhetoric is not the place to enter. It is explained by Trendelenburg, <hi rend="italic">Comm. on de Anima</hi>, II 1, <hi rend="italic">Elem. Log. Arist.</hi> &sect; 6, p. 61. <foreign lang="greek">δύναμις</foreign> is treated in Metaph. <foreign lang="greek">Θ</foreign> 1&mdash;5, and <foreign lang="greek">ἐνέργεια</foreign>, ib. 6&mdash;9, on which consult Bonitz's <hi rend="italic">Commentary.</hi> Grant, <hi rend="italic">Essays on Ethics</hi>, Essay IV, pp. 181&mdash;201, 1st [or 2nd] ed., gives a full and clear account of the relation between them, and the doctrine in general, especially in its application to Moral Philosophy. Aristotle himself nowhere gives a complete and intelligible description of this antithesis and its bearings, but assumes the knowledge of it in all his writings. </p>
						<p>&lsquo;Now sometimes the degree of crime, the comparative criminality, may be determined in this way; in other cases it is decided, or estimated, by the (actual amount of the) harm or injury done&rsquo;. <foreign lang="greek">ἐκ</foreign> &lsquo;from&rsquo;, means <pb n="262"/> that the decision or estimate of the amount of criminality <hi rend="italic">proceeds</hi> or <hi rend="italic">is derived from</hi> the comparison of the injury or consequences resulting from the two acts. </p>
					</div3>
					<div3 id="b1c14s2" type="section" n="2">
						<p>&lsquo;And when there is no punishment (in use) equal or adequate (to the offence), but any one (that exists or can be devised) is too slight for it&rsquo;; supply <foreign lang="greek">ἀδίκημα μεῖζόν ἐστι</foreign>. </p>
						<p>&lsquo;And where the mischief done is incurable: for it is hard (or grievous), or indeed impossible&rsquo;. To fill up the sense either repeat <foreign lang="greek">ἰᾶσθαι</foreign>, &lsquo;to find any adequate remedy or compensation&rsquo;; or, from <foreign lang="greek">οὗ μὴ ἴση τιμωρία</foreign>, &lsquo;to devise any adequate punishment&rsquo;. Otherwise it may be supposed (though it is unnecessary) that Aristotle wrote <foreign lang="greek">ἀδύνατον</foreign>, having <foreign lang="greek">ἀμήχανον</foreign> or some similar adjective in his mind, meaning &lsquo;a helpless, hopeless, irremediable&rsquo; case. </p>
						<p>&lsquo;And again crimes for which no legal redress is to be obtained by the injured party: for such a wrong is incurable: because &lsquo;justice&rsquo; (trial and sentence) and punishment are so many <hi rend="italic">remedies</hi>&rsquo;. On this doctrine of punishment, and the difference between <foreign lang="greek">κόλασις</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">τιμωρία</foreign>, see above I 10. 17, and Introd. p. 232. Cf. Ar. Eth. Nic. II 2, 1104 <hi rend="italic">b</hi> 16, <foreign lang="greek">μηνύουσι δὲ καὶ αἱ κολάσεις γινόμεναι διὰ τούτων· ἰατρεῖαι γάρ τινές εἰσιν, αἱ δὲ ἰατρεῖαι διὰ τῶν ἐναντίων πεφύκασι γίνεσθαι</foreign>. </p>
						<p>&lsquo;And if (in consequence of the wrong done) the sufferer and the victim of the wrong inflicted some heavy punishment on himself; for the perpetrator of the act deserves a still severer punishment (than that which he thus unintentionally brought upon his victim): as Sophocles, in pleading the cause of Euctemon&mdash;after he had killed himself in consequence of the outrage he had sustained&mdash;said that he would not lay the penalty at a less amount than the sufferer had estimated it at for himself&rsquo;, i. e. Euctemon by his suicide had virtually fixed the penalty of the offence at death. </p>

						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">δίκαιος κολασθῆναι</lemma>] On this idiomatic usage of <foreign lang="greek">δίκαιος</foreign>, and similar constructions&mdash;in which the adjective, instead of being expressed impersonally in the neuter, as <foreign lang="greek">δίκαιόν ἐστι</foreign>, is attracted as it were to the subject of the sentence&mdash;especially with <foreign lang="greek">δῆλος</foreign> and its compounds, <foreign lang="greek">φανερός, γελοῖος</foreign>, and such like, see Matth. <hi rend="italic">Gr. Gr.</hi> &sect; 297, comp. 549. 5. It is to be observed that the case of <foreign lang="greek">δίκαιος</foreign> is peculiar; this takes the infinitive, whereas all the rest are construed with the participle.

						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">Σοφοκλῆς</lemma>] Not the poet, but a statesman and orator advanced in life at the close of the Peloponnesian war. He was one of the ten <foreign lang="greek">πρόβουλοι</foreign>, Rhet. III 18. 6, appointed by the Athenians, after the Sicilian disaster in 413 B.C., to devise measures for the public safety, Thuc. VIII I, Grote's <hi rend="italic">Hist. Gr.</hi> Pt. II, ch. 61, Vol. VII, p. 499, and note: and afterwards one of the thirty tyrants, Xen. Hellen. II 3. 2. This Sophocles is doubtless the same who is again mentioned, Rhet. III 15. 3. He is there described as an old man, which agrees with the statement of Thucydides, u. s., that the <foreign lang="greek">πρόβουλοι</foreign> were an <foreign lang="greek">ἀρχὴ πρεσβυτέρων ἀνδρῶν</foreign>; and the &lsquo;charge&rsquo; brought against him (Rhet. l. c.) was probably connected with his conduct as a member of &lsquo;the thirty&rsquo;. </p>
						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">τιμήσειν, ἐτίμησεν</lemma>] In all causes civil as well as criminal which could be brought before an Athenian law-court, one point to be considered in the judgment was the <foreign lang="greek">τίμημα</foreign> or estimate, assessment, either of the kind or amount of the penalty in criminal prosecutions, or of the damages in civil actions. This gives rise to the division of all legal processes into <foreign lang="greek">ἀγῶνες ἀτίμητοι</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">τιμητοί</foreign>. In the former of these the penalty and damages are already fixed by law or by previous private arrangement (C. R. Kennedy), and are therefore &lsquo;unassessable&rsquo; by the judges; in the <foreign lang="greek">τιμητοὶ ἀγῶνες</foreign> of all kinds, the amount of the damages or penalty to be awarded is at the discretion of the judges, who <foreign lang="greek">τιμῶσιν</foreign>, estimate, assess, or fix the amount. This is the explanation of Harpocration, and Ulpian, followed by Meier &amp; Sch&ouml;mann, <hi rend="italic">Attischer Process</hi>, p. 171 note, B&ouml;ckh <hi rend="italic">Publ. Econ.</hi> Bk. III, c. 11 (p. 371 Engl. Transl.), and Hermann <hi rend="italic">Pol. Antiq.</hi> &sect; 143. 7&mdash;12. Suidas, and other ancient writers, invert this distinction, and make <foreign lang="greek">τιμητοὶ ἀγῶνες</foreign> the cases in which the penalty is already fixed, and <foreign lang="greek">ἀτίμητοι</foreign> those in which it is open to adjudication. See Meier &amp; Sch&ouml;mann, u. s., p. 171 note. </p>
						<p>On the whole subject see Meier &amp; Sch&ouml;mann u. s. et seq. and Mr C. R. Kennedy's article in Smith's <hi rend="italic">Dict. Antiq.</hi> p. 970 (1st ed.) [p. 1131, 2nd ed. and cf. note on Dem. <hi rend="italic">Select Private Orations</hi>, Part II, Or. 55 &sect; 18. S.] </p>
						<p>The accuser in a criminal process, where the penalty was not already fixed by law, himself in the first instance assessed its amount, which the judges confirmed or not as they thought proper. The first was called <foreign lang="greek">τιμᾶσθαι</foreign>, the second <foreign lang="greek">τιμᾶν</foreign>, in accordance with the usual distinction of the active and middle voice, as marking by their contrasted significations the functions of the judge and the parties in the case, <foreign lang="greek">δικάζειν</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">δικάζεσθαι, κρίνειν</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">κρίνεσθαι</foreign>, &amp;c.; the one administering justice and deciding the question, whilst the others &lsquo;get this done for them&rsquo; by the intervention of another. Aristotle has here neglected this ordinary distinction, for reasons best known to himself. As far as the phrase <foreign lang="greek">ὁ παθὼν ἐτίμησεν</foreign> <pb n="264"/> is concerned, the reason might be, that the accuser is supposed to represent the estimate by the deceased of his own wrongs as of equal authority with a judicial decision: but this will not apply to <foreign lang="greek">τιμήσειν</foreign>, Sophocles' own estimate. At the same time as <foreign lang="greek">τιμᾶν</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">τίμημα</foreign> may denote an &lsquo;estimate&rsquo; in general, the use of the verb here must be regarded rather as a departure from ordinary usage, than as a solecism, or violation of the laws of the language. </p>
						<p>On the <foreign lang="greek">συνήγοροι</foreign>, see Schneider's note on Pol. VI 5. 10, vol. II, p. 391, and <hi rend="italic">addenda</hi>, pp. 502&mdash;4. <foreign lang="greek">συνηγορῶν</foreign> here is not technical: there is no reason to suppose that it denotes one of the public <foreign lang="greek">συνήγοροι</foreign>, appointed by the state. </p>
						<p>Lastly, the entire topic, <foreign lang="greek">καὶ εἰ ὁ παθώνἐτίμησεν</foreign>, is thus illustrated by Schrader: &lsquo;Sexti Tarquinii flagitium ideo maius est, quod illius foeditate inducta Lucretia sibi ipsi vim intulit. (This is suggested by Victorius.) Et Appii Claudii decemviri sceleratum de L. Virginii filia iudicium eo sceleratius est, quoniam pater illo commotus filiam interfecit (Liv. III 48).&rsquo; </p>
					</div3>
					<div3 id="b1c14s4" type="section" n="4">
						<p>&lsquo;And any crime that is unique, or the first of its class (that has been committed), or has been seldom paralleled&rsquo;. These three cases of especial prominence have been already applied to acts as topics of praise, I. 9. 38. See in illustration the references there given. </p>
						<p>&lsquo;And the frequent commission of the same offence magnifies it&rsquo;: because this shews the depraved <hi rend="italic">habit</hi>, or confirmed state, the <foreign lang="greek">ἕξις</foreign> which constitutes vice. &lsquo;Nec enim is casu aut affectu, sed habitu et pravitate animi, delinquit.&rsquo; Schrader. </p>
						<p>&lsquo;And any crime for which any checks and preventives or penalties have been sought and found (invented or discovered), as, for instance, at Argos a penalty is incurred by any one on whose account a law has been enacted (i.e. one of the <foreign lang="greek">&lt;&gt;ωλυτικοί</foreign>, or (if I may coin a word for the occasion)  <foreign lang="greek">ζημιωτικοί, νόμοι</foreign>), or on whose account the prison was built&rsquo;: supply <foreign lang="greek">ἐζημιώθησαν</foreign>. This same topic has been already employed in the opposite sense, to heighten the praise due to an action, c. 9 &sect; 38. Schrader quotes in illustration Lysias, Or. XXII &sect; 16 (<foreign lang="greek">κατὰ τῶν σιτοπώλων</foreign>), <foreign lang="greek">οὕτω δὲ πάλαι περὶ τῆς τούτων πανουργίας καὶ κακονοίας ἡ πόλις ἔγνωκεν, ὥστ’  ἐπὶ μὲν τοῖς ἄλλοις ὠνίοις ἅπασι τοὺς ἀγορανόμους φύλακας κατεστήσατε, ἐπὶ δὲ ταύτῃ μόνῃ τῇ τέχνῃ χωρὶς σιτοφύλακας ἀποκληροῦτε</foreign>; the appointment of a special board of officers for the control of the corn-market signalizes the special rascality of the dealers. </p>
					</div3>
					<div3 id="b1c14s5" type="section" n="5">
						<p>&lsquo;And the more brutal the crime is, the worse&rsquo;; that is, the nearer approach it makes to the conduct and instincts of a mere animal or brute, who is incapable of virtue and self-control; and the more cruel, savage, &lsquo;inhuman&rsquo; it is, more degraded below the level of humanity. </p>
						<p>There are three degrees in the scale of natures, moral and intellectual, (1) the beast, (2) the man, and (3) the god. Thus, Pol. I 2, 1253 <hi rend="italic">a</hi> 27, it is <pb n="265"/> said of a man that is incapable of society, or is in want of nothing, being all-sufficient to himself, that he is <foreign lang="greek">ἢ θηρίον ἢ θεός</foreign>: in respect of this complete independence he is either below or above all the various wants, instincts, affections, desires, aims, and aspirations that characterize humanity. Precisely the same view appears in the little disquisition on <foreign lang="greek">θηριότης</foreign> at the opening of Book VII of the Nicom. Ethics, except that here the distinction between the three natures is made to rest solely upon intellectual and moral virtue: this is human, whereas the beast and the god are alike incapable of it, the beast, from the defects already stated, being below the human standard, the gods above it. </p>
						<p>On this superiority of the gods to the practice of moral or human virtue and their entire independence of it, see Eth. Nic. X 8. A fine fragment of Cicero's lost dialogue <hi rend="italic">de Philosophia sive Hortensius</hi>, quoted by Augustine, <hi rend="italic">de Trinitate</hi> XIV c. 9, is manifestly borrowed, not translated, from this passage of Aristotle. It is printed in Nobbe's edition of Cicero, p. 1171, fragm. 35. </p>
						<p>Here therefore &lsquo;brutality&rsquo; consists in the absence of all capacity for virtue, moral and intellectual, and is consequently opposed to <foreign lang="greek">τὴν ὑπὲρ ἡμᾶς ἀρετήν, ἡρωικήν τινα καὶ θείαν</foreign>. This brutal nature, like the divine, is extremely rate amongst mankind. (This statement is qualified in Pol. III 11, 1281 <hi rend="italic">b</hi> 19, <foreign lang="greek">καίτοι τί διαφέρουσιν ἔνιοι τῶν θηρίων ὡς ἔπος εἰπεῖν; ἀλλὰ περί τι πλῆθος οὐδὲν εἶναι ἀληθὲς κωλύει τὸ λεχθέν</foreign>). It is found chiefly in &lsquo;barbarians&rsquo;. &lsquo;Barbarous&rsquo; and &lsquo;barbarity&rsquo; in fact express pretty nearly the same notion of character.) Again, the absence of all moderation in the indulgence of our desires and emotions and general want of selfcontrol is characteristic of the &lsquo;brutal&rsquo; nature; lb. c. 6, 1148 <hi rend="italic">b</hi> 34, <foreign lang="greek">τὸ μὲν οὖν ἔχειν ἕκαστα τούτων ἔξω τῶν ὅρων ἐστὶ τῆς κακίας, καθάπερ καὶ ἡ θηριότης</foreign>. And again, 1149 <hi rend="italic">a</hi> 4, <foreign lang="greek">πᾶσα ὑπερβάλλουσα καὶ ἀφροσύνη καὶ δειλία καὶ ἀκολασία καὶ χαλεπότης αἱ μὲν θηριώδεις αἱ δὲ νοσηματώδεις εἰσιν</foreign>. And these are then illustrated, <foreign lang="greek">ὁ μὲν γὰρ φύσει τοιοῦτος οἷος δεδιέναι πάντα, κἂν ψοφήσῃ μῦς, θηριώδη δειλίαν δειλός·...καὶ τῶν ἀφρόνων οἱ μὲν ἐκ φύσεως ἀλόγιστοι καὶ μόνον αἰσθήσει ζῶντες θηριώδεις</foreign>. (<foreign lang="greek">αἴσθησις</foreign> is the characteristic of &lsquo;animal life&rsquo; in general; that which distinguishes <hi rend="italic">animals</hi> from <hi rend="italic">plants.</hi> de Anima.) Brutal &lsquo;tastes&rsquo; or instincts are illustrated a little earlier in the same chapter, 1048 <hi rend="italic">b</hi> 20 seq. Brutal (or animal) pleasures are those which we have in common with the lower animals, the pleasures of feeling and taste; in the over-indulgence of which, this form of bestiality lies, III 13, 1118 <hi rend="italic">a</hi> 23&mdash;<hi rend="italic">b</hi> 4. Gaisford refers to Magna Moralia II 5 init., <foreign lang="greek">ἔστι δὲ ἡ θηριότης ὑπερβάλλουσά τις κακία· ὅταν γάρ τινα παντελῶς ἴδωμεν φαῦλον οὐδ’  ἄνθρωπόν φαμεν εἶναι ἀλλὰ θηρίον, ὡς οὖσάν τινα κακίαν θηριότητα. ἡ δ̓ ἀντικειμένη ἀρετὴ ταύτῃ ἐστὶν ἀνώνυμος, ἔστι δὲ ἡ τοιαύτη ὑπὲρ ἄνθρωπον οὖσα, οἷον ἡρωική τις καὶ θεία</foreign>: expressions directly taken from the passages of Eth. N. VII just quoted. Finally, the instinctive <foreign lang="greek">ὀρέξεις</foreign> (<foreign lang="greek">θυμός</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">ἐπιθυμία</foreign>) belong to this animal part of our nature, and are therefore not always under our control; Pol. III 16, 1267 <hi rend="italic">a</hi> 28; where the divine part of our nature, the controlling, regulating, intelligent <foreign lang="greek">νοῦς</foreign>, is contrasted with the lower instincts of the brute elements of our nature, the emotional and appetitive. <pb n="266"/> </p>
						<p>&lsquo;And when it arises from or is due to malice aforethought&rsquo;. <foreign lang="greek">προνοία</foreign> is the &lsquo;forethought&rsquo;, the <hi rend="italic">deliberate</hi> vicious <hi rend="italic">purpose</hi> which constitutes &lsquo;malice prepense&rsquo;, aggravates a wrong act in proportion to its intensity and the length of time during which the evil intent has been nursed; and converts an act otherwise innocent into a crime. The <foreign lang="greek">προνοία</foreign> is that which distinguishes murder from homicide. It is in fact the moral <foreign lang="greek">προαίρεσις</foreign>, distinctive of vice and virtue, of which an account has been already given in the first note on this chapter. See the passage of Eth. Nic. V 10, there quoted. Comp. Rhet. I 13. 10. There <foreign lang="greek">ἐκ προνοίας</foreign> is identified with the (in Ethics) more ordinary <foreign lang="greek">ἐκ προαιρέσεως. ὅταν δὲ ἐκ προαιρέσεως</foreign> (<foreign lang="greek">ἡ βλάβη</foreign>) <foreign lang="greek">ἄδικος καὶ μοχθηρός. διὸ καλῶς τὰ ἐκ θυμοῦ</foreign> (actions which are done in a state of violent excitement, under the impulse of overpowering passion, are considered as involuntary, and exempted from the penalty of crimes) <foreign lang="greek">οὐκ ἐκ προνοίας κρίνεται</foreign>. The case quoted by Schrader from Magna Moralia I 17, of a woman who had caused the death of her lover by a love-potion which she had sent him only with the view of inflaming his passion, and was consequently acquitted by the court of Areopagus on the charge of murder, because the act was done without deliberate malevolent intent, is a case of <foreign lang="greek">ἁμάρτημα</foreign> (one of those in which the wrong done does not amount to a crime), in which the mischief is done without due knowledge of the circumstances of the case. In Demosth. c. Aristocr. p. 634, there is a similar distinction between two kinds of <foreign lang="greek">ἀνδροφονία</foreign>: in one sense the name is applied <foreign lang="greek">ἐπ’  ἀκουσίῳ φόνῳ</foreign>, and to acts of this kind &lsquo;a wise and humane law&rsquo;, <foreign lang="greek">νόμος ἀνθρωπίνως καὶ καλῶς κείμενος</foreign>, does not apply the name of murder; from this are immediately afterwards distinguished <foreign lang="greek">οἱ ἐκ προνοίας</foreign> (<foreign lang="greek">φονεύσαντες</foreign>). Aeschines c. Ctesiph. &sect; 212, <foreign lang="greek">εἴληφε τραύματος ἐκ προνοίας γραφὰς γραφόμενος</foreign>. Dinarch. c. Demosth. &sect; 6, <foreign lang="greek">τῶν ἐκ προνοίας φόνων</foreign>. Compare Cic. de Off. I 8, sub fin. <hi rend="italic">Sed in omni iniustitia permultum interest utrum perturbatione aliqua animi, quae plerumque brevis est et ad tempus, an consulto et cogitata fiat iniuria. Leviora enim sunt quae repentino aliquo motu accidunt quam ea quae meditata ac praeparata inferuntur.</hi> </p>
						<p>&lsquo;And any act, or wrong done, which inspires the hearers rather with terror than compassion&rsquo;. An act which tends to consequences which inspire terror, the stronger emotion, in those who may be exposed to the like treatment, must plainly be more striking in its character and important in its social effects, more noxious and prejudicial, and worse in general, than one which excites mere pity or sympathy with the sufferer, without raising alarm on account of what may follow to oneself. That which excites terror must be terrible; formidable and dangerous to the individual or society. An atrocious crime makes men tremble, and fear expels pity; the stronger emotion overpowers the weaker. Comp. Rhet. II 8. 5 and 12, &lsquo;Amasis shed no tears when he saw his son led away to <pb n="267"/> death, but wept when his friends asked an alms&rsquo;: <foreign lang="greek">τοῦτο μὲν γὰρ ἐλεεινόν, ἐκεῖνο δὲ δεινόν· τὸ γὰρ δεινὸν ἕτερον τοῦ ἐλεεινοῦ καὶ ἐκκρουστικὸν τοῦ ἐλέου καὶ πολλάκις τῷ ἐναντίῳ χρήσιμον</foreign>. Victorius quotes Cic. Tusc. Qu. III 27, <hi rend="italic">Constabat eos qui concidentem vulneribus Gn. Pompeium vidissent, quum in illo ipso acerbissimo miserrimoque spectaculo sibi timerent quod se classe hostium circumfusos viderent, nihil tum aliud egisse nisi ut remiges hortarentur, et ut salutem adipiscerentur fuga: posteaquam Tyrum venissent tum afflictari lamentarique coepisse.</hi> </p>
						<p>&lsquo;And the rhetorical artifices or exaggerations&rsquo; (such as <foreign lang="greek">αὐξήσεις, δεινώσεις</foreign>, rhetorical tricks for giving extra importance and interest to a subject; or for magnifying, exaggerating, intensifying the atrocity, enormity, of a crime), &lsquo;for instance, that the accused (whose crime you desire to magnify) has subverted many principles (or obligations) of justice at once, or transgressed them; for instance, oaths, the right hand (pledge of faith, <foreign lang="greek">καὶ δεξιαὶ ᾗς ἐπέπιθμεν</foreign>, Il. B 341), &lsquo;all confidence or good faith, all the laws of intermarriage, and the rest; for this is an excess of many crimes over the one which has really been committed&rsquo;; or &lsquo;a multiplication of one crime into many&rsquo;. </p>
						<p>The exaggeration of this rhetorical fallacy lies in the enumeration, and apparent accumulation, of offences by division of the single offence into its parts, or the repetition&mdash;as in the instance&mdash;of the same offence under different names, which seems thus to swell its bulk and magnify its enormity. This is the reverse application of the same rhetorical artifice of exaggeration as has been already referred to in I 7. 31 (see note), the methods of <foreign lang="greek">διαίρεσις εἰς τὰ μέρη, συντιθέναι</foreign>, and <foreign lang="greek">ἐποικοδομεῖν</foreign> applied to the &lsquo;amplification&rsquo; of good things; the object and use of them being stated in nearly the same words, <foreign lang="greek">πλειόνων γὰρ ὑπερέχειν φαίνεται</foreign>. </p>
						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ἀναιρεῖν</lemma>, &lsquo;to take up, so as to remove, annul, or destroy&rsquo;; here <hi rend="italic">tollere, subvertere.</hi> The simple verb, as well as the phrase <foreign lang="greek">ἀναιρεῖν ἐκ μέσου</foreign>&mdash; comp. Lat. <hi rend="italic">de medio, e medio tollere</hi> (Cic., Liv.) is common in Demosth., Aesch. and the Orators, and occurs occasionally in other writers, as Plato and Xenophon, with words like <foreign lang="greek">νόμους, τὸ δίκαιον, διαθήκην, ὑποθέσεις</foreign> (Plato), or <foreign lang="greek">πόλιν, πολιτείαν, ὀλιγαρχίας</foreign> (Xenoph.). </p>
						<p>Gaisford illustrates the various forms of pledges or guarantees here mentioned by a corresponding passage in Arist. Acharn. 306, <foreign lang="greek">πῶς δ’  ἔτ̓ ἂν καλῶς λέγοις ἄν, εἴπερ ἐσπείσω γ̓ ἅπαξ οἷσιν οὔτε βωμὸς οὔτε πίστις οὔθ̓ ὅρκος μένει</foreign>. </p>

						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">καὶ τὸ ἐνταῦθα</lemma> (<foreign lang="greek">ἀδικεῖν</foreign>) <foreign lang="greek">οὗ κ.τ.λ.</foreign>] &lsquo;and to commit a crime in the very place where offenders are punished&rsquo; is an aggravation of the criminality; &lsquo;which is the case with perjurers or false witnesses: for where would a man <hi rend="italic">not</hi> commit a crime if he is ready to do it even in the very court of justice?&rsquo; This is the <hi rend="italic">argumentum a fortiori;</hi> the rule, <hi rend="italic">omne</hi> <pb n="268"/> <hi rend="italic">maius continet in se minus.</hi> &lsquo;Hinc P.

(Victorius has forgotten the still more striking <hi rend="italic">Etiam in senatum venit</hi>, &amp;c. of the first speech against Catiline, &sect; 2.) The sanctity of the place converts theft into sacrilege. The atrocity of the murder of &lsquo;Zacharias the son of Barachias&rsquo; was heightened by the circumstance of its occurrence &lsquo;between the temple and the altar&rsquo; (Matth. xxiii. 35). </p>
						<p>&lsquo;Another aggravation of an offence is, where it is attended by disgrace (to the victim); and this in proportion to its amount (<foreign lang="greek">μάλιστα</foreign>)&rsquo;. This, together with the wantonness, the unprovoked character of the aggression, is what converts a mere assault, <foreign lang="greek">αἰκία</foreign>, into an act of <foreign lang="greek">ὕβρις</foreign>, a wanton outrage. See Rhet. II 2. 5, definition of <foreign lang="greek">ὕβρις</foreign>, and I 13. 10; also note on I 12. 26, p. 239. The wound inflicted on a man's pride and sense of dignity, the injury to his feelings and honour, constitute a great aggravation of the offence. <foreign lang="greek">ὕβρις</foreign> is, <foreign lang="greek">τὸ βλάπτειν καὶ λυπεῖν ἐφ’  οἷς αἰσχύνη ἐστὶ τῷ πάσχοντι κ.τ.λ.</foreign> In II 6. 2, <foreign lang="greek">αἰσχύνη</foreign> is defined, <foreign lang="greek">λύπη τις ἢ ταραχὴ περὶ τὰ εἰς ἀδοξίαν φαινόμενα φέρειν τῶν κακῶν ἢ παρόντων ἢ γεγονότων η μελλόντων...ἐπὶ τοῖς τοιούτοις τῶν κακῶν ὅσα αἰσχρὰ δοκεῖ εἶναι ἢ αὐτῷ ἢ ὧν φροντίζει</foreign>. </p>
						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">καὶ εἰ τοῦτον</lemma> (<foreign lang="greek">ἠδίκηκέ τις</foreign>)] &lsquo;and another is, when the victim of his wrong has been his benefactor; for his offence is thereby multiplied; in that he not only <hi rend="italic">does</hi> what is wrong (positive wrong, a sin of commission), but also fails, omits, to do what is right (negative wrong, a sin of omission). The last explanatory clause is thus illustrated by Victorius from Cicero's criticism of the third Stoic Paradox, &sect; 25 <foreign lang="greek">ὅτι ἴσα τὰ ἁμαρτήματα καὶ τὰ κατορθώματα</foreign>. <hi rend="italic">Illud tamen interest quod in servo necando, si adsit iniuria, semel peccatur; in patris vita violanda multa peccantur; violatur is qui procreavit; is qui aluit: is qui erudivit; is qui in sede ac domo atque in republica collocavit: multitudine peccatorum praestat</hi> (<foreign lang="greek">ὑπερέχει</foreign>), <hi rend="italic">eoque poena maiore dignus est.</hi> </p>

(Any external force destroys the voluntary character of an act, and therefore its virtue. And if this voluntary obedience to the unwritten law implies a more virtuous disposition than that which is enforced by the positive enactments which have power to compel it, then the <hi rend="italic">opposite</hi> is true, an act of disobedience to the unwritten law is a worse offence, and a sign of a more vicious disposition, <pb n="269"/> than the violation of the other.) &lsquo;Now the written laws are compulsory, the unwritten are not&rsquo;. </p>

					<p>The general sense and connexion of the contents of this chapter upon the <foreign lang="greek">ἄτεχνοι πίστεις</foreign> of the practice of Rhetoric, those adjuncts of proof and external supports of the case, which consist in the various kinds of evidence which can be adduced by the pleader in confirmation of his statements and arguments, have been already given in the Introduction to this Commentary, pp. 193&mdash;207, to which I now refer and which I need not here repeat. They are called &lsquo;unartistic&rsquo; or &lsquo;inartificial&rsquo; because they are not due to the artist's inventive skill, but are supplied to him from the outside, as it were, of his art; and all that he has to do is to use them to the best advantage. Rhet. I 2. 2. It is this distinction of two kinds of proof or modes of persuasion which explains the application of the term <hi rend="italic">inventio</hi> by the Latin rhetoricians to that part of the art to which Aristotle first gave the name of <foreign lang="greek">ἔντεχνοι πίστεις</foreign>, and the title of one of Cicero's rhetorical treatises, the <hi rend="italic">de Inventione.</hi> The author himself, l. c., applies the term <foreign lang="greek">εὑρεῖν</foreign> to the <foreign lang="greek">ἔντεχνοι πίστεις</foreign>. </p>

						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">εἰπεῖν μοι</lemma>] This, and the following line of Solon's elegy, is quoted, with two variations from Aristotle's version, by Proclus ad Tim. 20 E, </p>
						<p/>
						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">εἰπέμεναι Κριτίῃ ξανθότριχι πατρὸς ἀκούειν· οὐ γὰρ ἁμαρτινόῳ πείσεται ἡγεμόνι</lemma>, </p>
						<p>the father of Critias being Solon's brother, Dropides. These verses, which were probably intended by the author as a compliment to the father, are misconstrued by the malicious Cleophon into a reflection on the son, whose recklessness and licentiousness had brought upon him his father's displeasure: the authority of Solon is appealed to to shew that the grandson inherited his grandfather's vices. Whether <foreign lang="greek">πυῤῥότριχι</foreign> is another malicious perversion of Cleophon, on the hypothesis that red hair implies a licentious disposition, or depravity in general&mdash;as seems to have been the opinion of the Normans, who had the proverb, <hi rend="italic">entre poil roux et f&eacute;lonie s'entreportent grant compagnie</hi>, (Wace, <hi rend="italic">Roman de Rou</hi>, quoted by Sir F. Palgrave, <hi rend="italic">Hist. of Norm.</hi> II 721)&mdash;or Aristotle, quoting from memory, has <hi rend="italic">mis</hi>quoted, <hi rend="italic">more suo</hi>, cannot now be ascertained. At all events it is unlikely that <hi rend="italic">Solon</hi> intended any such imputation on Critias' character, whatever may have been the case with Cleophon; for <pb n="277"/> Critias is evidently considered as a boy or very young man from the tone of the address or message, and Victorius shews from Theocr. Id. VIII. 3, <foreign lang="greek">ἄμφω τώγ’  ἤτην πυῤῥοτρίχω, ἄμφω ἀνάβω</foreign>, that red hair in a boy in the eyes of the Greeks was a beauty and not a deformity. It seems to me that Solon wrote <foreign lang="greek">ξανθότριχι</foreign>, as Proclus gives it, and that the other reading is due either to Cleophon's malice if we interpret it <hi rend="italic">in deterius</hi>, or to Aristotle's want of memory, if we take it as synonymous with <foreign lang="greek">ξανθότριχι</foreign>. The evidence of Critias' <foreign lang="greek">ἀσέλγεια</foreign> derived from the verses is plainly a false inference of Cleophon and not really contained in the original: the statement in Plat. Charm. 157 E, that Solon wrote Elegies in praise of &lsquo;the house of Critias&rsquo;, and spoke of its members as &lsquo;distinguished by personal beauty and virtue and all other so-called happiness&rsquo;, is altogether against any such supposition. Victorius, who regards the inference drawn by Cleophon as justified by the language of the verses, endeavours to reconcile this with the eulogistic character of the elegy, by the remark that Critias may have been an exception to the general good character of his family. Bergk, <hi rend="italic">Poet. Lyr. Gr.</hi> p. 331, follows Proclus' version. The other variation, <foreign lang="greek">εἰπεῖν μοι</foreign>, and <foreign lang="greek">εἰπέμεναι</foreign>, may be either another slip of Aristotle's memory, or <foreign lang="greek">εἰπεῖν μοι</foreign> a mere false reading of <foreign lang="greek">εἰπέμεναι</foreign>, the one being very easily mistaken for the other. </p>
						<p>Lastly, <foreign lang="greek">μοί</foreign>, if it were retained, would be a good example of the <hi rend="italic">dativus ethicus</hi> corresponding in Greek to the familiar use of &lsquo;me&rsquo; in the earlier English writers: as Shakespeare, Rob me the treasury; He smiled me in the face (Dame Quickly of Falstaff); See how this river comes me cranking in (Hotspur).

						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">κατασκευάζειν</lemma>] is a technical term of dialectics, denoting the constructive process and object of argumentation or syllogism, viz. to establish some <hi rend="italic">positive</hi> conclusion, to maintain or confirm a thesis; and opposed to <foreign lang="greek">ἀνασκευάζειν</foreign>, which represents the &lsquo;subversive&rsquo;, &lsquo;destructive&rsquo; (<foreign lang="greek">ἀνασκευάζειν</foreign> &lsquo;to undo&rsquo;, comp. <foreign lang="greek">λύειν</foreign> &lsquo;to break up, or dissolve a thing into its elements&rsquo;), &lsquo;refutative&rsquo; syllogism or reasoning which proves a negative. On these terms see further in Introd. p. 268, and note (on p. 267) on the same page. </p>
						<p>&lsquo;Now in regard of establishing their credit or discrediting them, the treatment of this in no respect differs from that of the witnesses; for according to the character of those whose names are attached to, subscribed to, (inscribed <hi rend="italic">upon</hi>, as <foreign lang="greek">ἐπίγραμμα</foreign>, the <hi rend="italic">title</hi> of a crime or a legal prosecution, I 13. 9,) the document, or contract, or who have it in their keeping, the measure (degree) of credit or trustworthiness of the contract is determined (<hi rend="italic">lit.</hi> by them are the contracts made trustworthy)&rsquo;. <pb n="282"/> </p>
						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">τούτοις πισταί</lemma>] is a somewhat irregular expression, meaning <foreign lang="greek">τοσούτῳ πιστοτέραι εἰσὶν αἱ συνθῆκαι</foreign> or <foreign lang="greek">τοιαῦται καὶ αἱ συνθῆκαι τῷ πισταὶ εἶναι</foreign>. </p>
						<p>The degree of integrity of those who have the document in their custody is a measure of the probability of its having been tampered with or not. </p>
						<p>&lsquo;The existence of the contract being admitted, if the document be our own (&sect; 26), we must <hi rend="italic">magnify</hi> it (cry it up; <hi rend="italic">increase</hi>, exaggerate, its value and importance); for the contract (we may say) is a law, special and partial; and it is not the contracts that give authority, or validity, to the law, but the laws to the contracts which are made in conformity with them (legally)&rsquo;. Either of these arguments may be urged to shew that a covenant has the sanction of law, and shares its authority. &lsquo;And, speaking generally, the law itself is a kind of contract, and therefore any one who violates (disobeys) the provisions (understand <foreign lang="greek">συνθήκῃ</foreign> after <foreign lang="greek">ἀπιστεῖ</foreign>) of a contract or makes away with it, is in fact subverting, doing away with, the laws&rsquo;. This doctrine has already been stated in other words, c. 13. 2, <foreign lang="greek">νόμον...ἴδιον μὲν τὸν ἑκάστοις ὡρισμένον πρὸς αὑτούς</foreign>. This is therefore the positive, written, local or national law, varying in different societies, and enacted by each of them severally for mutual convenience, under an implied contract to observe and maintain them. </p>
						<p>Analogous to this view of law as a contract is the theory, in Politics, of the <hi rend="italic">Social Contract</hi>, which has been maintained by Locke, Rousseau, and many others. This view of the origin of the social organization and of government, is founded upon the natural freedom and equality of men; and assumes a common agreement amongst the members of a state to live and act together for purposes of self-defence and mutual advantage in obedience to laws and an executive authority which the theory supposes to have emanated originally from themselves, and to be invalid without their consent. Similar to this are the &lsquo;laws of war&rsquo;, which give the conqueror certain rights over the conquered, amongst them that of enslaving, and result from a sort of international compact, or universal agreement.

There can be no doubt that the latter is right, and that the words <hi rend="italic">do</hi> express Aristotle's opinion upon the use of <pb n="286"/> torture, by asserting the truth and right of the arguments directed <hi rend="italic">against</hi> the use of it.

						<p>On the passage which in MS A^{c} concludes this section, and is printed in the note of the Oxford reprint of Bekker's 1st ed., see in Introd. p. 201, and the note. It is omitted by Bekker. Spengel, <hi rend="italic">On the Rhetoric</hi>, in <hi rend="italic">Bav. Trans.</hi> 1851, p. 51, thinks that it is an extract from some other treatise on Rhetoric, introduced by the transcribers. The last sentence at all events must be corrupt, being as it stands devoid of meaning and connexion with the preceding. Brandis in his tract in Schneidewin's <hi rend="italic">Philologus</hi>, IV i. p. 43, informs us that his Anonymous Annotator found the passage in the MSS that he used, though he thinks that Victorius was right in rejecting it as an interpolation. Victorius, a man whose judgment is to be relied on, writes thus. &lsquo;Delevi autem quia adulterinos putavi; aut enim ex alio scriptore artis haec pars sumta est (<hi rend="italic">so Spengel</hi>), aut Scholion olim fuit quod importune post in contextum verborum Aristotelis translatum sit;...Qui accurate quae supra a philosopho iam tradita erant perpendit ipsius haec non esse manifesto intelligit; cuncta enim ille quae ad quaestiones pertinentia dicere voluerat iam explicaverat; sententia vero quae his viribus exponitur superioribus continetur; vox etiam iuncta illic est quae sermonem Aristotelis non redolet, viz. <foreign lang="greek">λιθόδερμος</foreign> (<hi rend="italic">this applies still more strongly to</hi> <foreign lang="greek">καταθαῤῥεῖν</foreign>); et omnis denique haec locutio, e. c. <foreign lang="greek">ταῖς ψυχαῖς ὄντες δυνατοί</foreign>, locutionis Aristotelicae dissimilis videtur&rsquo;. </p>

						<p>On oaths, see the corresponding chapter of Quintilian, V 6. Rhet. ad Alex. c. 17 (18). A full explanation of the connexion and general meaning of this and the following sections to the end of the Chapter will be found in the Introd. pp. 202&mdash;205, to which the reader is referred; so <pb n="287"/> that we may confine ourselves here as before to the <hi rend="italic">details</hi> that require notice. One puzzling circumstance which pervades this Chapter, tending to confusion, and adding to the difficulties arising from the extreme brevity of the expression (&lsquo;<hi rend="italic">brevis esse laborat obscurus fit</hi>&rsquo;, is especially true of Aristotle here, as indeed in most of his writings,) it may be worth while to draw attention to; and that is, that throughout it both plaintiff and defendant are made to argue in the <hi rend="italic">third</hi> person; to avoid this, <hi rend="italic">you</hi> may may be substituted for Aristotle's <hi rend="italic">he</hi> to designate the person who is in immediate possession of the argument, whichever side of the case he may be at the time maintaining. </p>

						<p>The case is: you refuse to tender the oath to the adverse party because it is of no use; he is so little embarrassed by scruples of conscience that he will take the oath and keep the money, so that you gain nothing by your motion. <foreign lang="greek">τούς δε</foreign> &lsquo;but the judges, <hi rend="italic">you</hi> think, if he do <hi rend="italic">not</hi> swear, will decide against him&rsquo;. </p>
						<p>Another reason, or topic, for refusing to tender the oath is, that &lsquo;this form of risk&rsquo;, the risk that one runs by leaving the matter to, by throwing oneself upon, the judges (<foreign lang="greek">ὁ κίνδυνος οὗτος ὁ ἐν τοῖς δικασταῖς</foreign>), is to be preferred (<foreign lang="greek">κρείττων</foreign>), viz. to the risk incurred of losing your suit by tendering oath to the adversary, who will probably perjure himself: you therefore refer your case to the decision of the judges, because you can trust them, but not the other. </p>

					<div3 id="b1c15s29" type="section" n="29">
						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ἀντὶ χρημάτων</lemma>] is, setting a pecuniary value upon the oath (estimating it <hi rend="italic">against</hi> money, at so much money value), which is degrading to the dignity and sanctity of the oath, and <hi rend="italic">therefore</hi> it is that you refuse to take it, and not from any baser motive. </p>
						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">κατωμόσατο] κατομνύναι</lemma> (<foreign lang="greek">ὅρκον</foreign>) occurs in Arist. Ran. 305, 306, appa<pb n="288"/> rently as a mere synonym of the simple verb, <foreign lang="greek">Δ. καἶθις κατόμοσον. Ξ. νὴ Δί̓; Δ. ὄμοσον. Ξ. νὴ Δία</foreign>. With <foreign lang="greek">ὅρκον</foreign> and a second accus. of the thing sworn by, Eur. Hel. 835, <foreign lang="greek">ἀλλ’  ἁγνὸν ὅρκον σὸν κάρα κατώμοσα</foreign>. The middle voice is found again in Herod. VI 65, but in a different sense &lsquo;to swear against&rsquo;, with a genitive following. Here, and in the two other cases quoted above, the <foreign lang="greek">κατά</foreign> seems to have an intensive force, expressing the &lsquo;binding force&rsquo; of an oath. This sense of <foreign lang="greek">κατά</foreign> comes from the original, physical, notion of &lsquo;keeping <hi rend="italic">down</hi>&rsquo;. </p>
						<p>For the interpretation of this obscure topic, see Introd. p. 203. The obscurity is a little heightened by Bekker's punctuation, and may be very slightly cleared up by reading <foreign lang="greek">μὴ ὀμόσας δ’  οὔ</foreign> (with colon instead of full stop) and at the end of the next clause <foreign lang="greek">τὸ μή</foreign>. (with full stop instead of colon). There is a considerably closer connexion between the two clauses which he separates by a full stop, than there is between the two which are divided only by a colon. </p>
						<p>The intention of the topic is to shew the purity and disinterestedness of the speaker's motives in refusing to take the oath. </p>
						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">καὶ τὸ τοῦ Ξενοφάνους</lemma>] Xenophanes of Colophon, the founder of the Eleatic school of Philosophy (Plat. Soph. 242 D, <foreign lang="greek">τὸ δὲ παῤ ἡμῖν Ἐλεατικὸν ε&lt;&gt;θνος, ἀπὸ Ξενοφάνους...ἀρξάμενον</foreign>)&mdash;of which Parmenides his follower was the most distinguished representative, who converted the theological conception of universal being, represented by Xenophanes as God, into the metaphysical conception of the Universe as One,  <foreign lang="greek">ἓν τὸ ὄν</foreign>&mdash; appears to have conveyed his philosophical doctrines in hexameter verse, an example subsequently followed by Parmenides and Empedocles. He also wrote elegies and iambics, the latter directed against Homer and Hesiod, whose manner of speaking about the Gods he disapproved, Diog. Laert. IX 2. 18. The verse quoted <hi rend="italic">here</hi> is a trochaic tetrameter; on which Mullach remarks, <hi rend="italic">Fragm. Phil. Gr.</hi> Xenoph. Fr. 25, p. 106, note, &lsquo;cuius versiculi hiatus in voce <foreign lang="greek">αὕτη</foreign> caesurae excusationem habet, prima autem syllaba in <foreign lang="greek">ἀσεβεῖ</foreign> producitur ad aliorum nominum velut <foreign lang="greek">ἀθάνατος</foreign> similitudinem&rsquo;. So Karsten, <hi rend="italic">Xenophanes</hi>, p. 79. The work which contained this verse is unknown. Mullach and Karsten agree in the opinion that this verse is all that belongs to Xenophanes in Aristotle's reference; the succeeding illustration is his own. All that is repeated in the converse of Xenophanes' maxim, &sect; 30, is what is contained in the verse itself. I have no doubt they are right. On Xenophanes and his philosophy, besides the two works already referred to, which contain collections of the surviving fragments, see the histories of Greek Philosophy, by Brandis, Zeller, Ritter, Butler, with Dr Thompson's notes and the rest; also Grote's Plato, Vol. I. pp. 16&mdash;19. <pb n="289"/> </p>
						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ἀλλ’  ὁμοία καὶ εἰ</lemma>] In this illustration of Xenophanes' dictum, the parallel case proposed by Aristotle, the strong man is the unscrupulous or godless man, who is ready to swear anything, true or false; he has the same advantage over the scrupulous, godfearing man, in a challenge to swear, as the strong man would have over the weak in a challenge to fight. </p>

All the moralists without exception admit that the essence of a lie resides not in the words, but in the intention and moral purpose; and the verse when properly interpreted asserts no more than this. <pb n="291"/> See Paley's note. It seems to me that the Hippolytus in its second and altered form, as we now have it, is, with the exception of the one fatal blot of Phaedra's false charge which brings about the death of the hero, one of the most moral and high-toned, as it certainly is one of the very best, of the extant tragedies of Euripides. </p>

					<p>In the following chapter we have a very brief account of the second kind of rhetorical proof, viz. the ethical, the <foreign lang="greek">ἦθος ἐν τῷ λέγοντι</foreign>.

As supplementary and auxiliary to the direct logical arguments this indirect ethical mode of persuasion is indispensable to the success of the speech. People are hardly likely to be convinced by a speaker who sets them against him. </p>
					<p>On the order of the subjects of the work in general, and the connexion of the contents of this Chapter, I refer as before to the Introduction [p. 245]. </p>
					<div3 id="b2c1s1" type="section" n="1">
						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ἐκ τίνων...ταῦτ’  ἐστίν</lemma>] This is a confusion of two constructions: the grammar requires either <foreign lang="greek">ἐκ τίνων εἴρηται</foreign> (or something similar), or else <foreign lang="greek">ἐξ ὧν ταῦτ’  ἐστί</foreign>. The <foreign lang="greek">ποῖαι</foreign> in the second clause shews that the first of the two was the one predominant in the writer's mind, which is carelessly varied at the end. </p>
						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">δόξαι καὶ προτάσεις</lemma>] These two are in fact the same. The current popular opinions are converted by the artist into premisses of rhetorical enthymemes. They are united again, c. 18 &sect; 2, comp. Topic. A 10, 104 <hi rend="italic">a</hi> 12, <foreign lang="greek">εἰσὶ δὲ προτάσεις διαλεκτικαὶ καὶ τὰ τοῖς ἐνδόξοις ὅμοια...καὶ ὅσαι δόξαι κατὰ τέχνας εἰσὶ τὰς εὑρημένας</foreign>. And c. 14, init. <foreign lang="greek">τὰς μὲν προτάσεις ἐκλεκτέον...καὶ ὅσαι δόξαι κατὰ τέχνας εἰσίν</foreign>. </p>
						<p>&lsquo;Now the sources from which we must derive our arguments in <pb n="2"/> exhorting and dissuading, in panegyric and censure, in accusation and defence, and the sort of opinions and premisses that are serviceable for (rhetorical) proof in them, are these: for these are the materials and sources of our enthymemes, specially, so to say, in each kind of speeches&rsquo;; i.e. using a special treatment according to the kind of speech on which we are engaged. If the text is right here, <foreign lang="greek">ἑς περὶ ἕκαστον εἰπεῖν ἰδίᾳ τὸ γένος τῶν λόγων</foreign>&mdash;Bekker retains it unaltered, and Spengel<note anchored="yes">In his treatise on the Rhetoric in <hi rend="italic">Trans.

						<p>&lsquo;For the assumption of a certain character by the speaker himself, and the supposition (of the audience) that he is disposed in a particular way (has certain feelings towards themselves), makes a great difference in respect of the persuasive effect of the speech, first and foremost in counselling or deliberation, and next in legal proceedings (<foreign lang="greek">ἦθος</foreign>); and besides this, whether they (the audience) are <hi rend="italic">themselves</hi> in some particular disposition (feeling, frame of mind) (towards him) (<foreign lang="greek">πάθος</foreign>)&rsquo;. </p>

The two which will be most serviceable to the public speaker are desire (<foreign lang="greek">ἐπιθυμία</foreign>) and hope (<foreign lang="greek">ἐλπίς</foreign>): those who are under the excitement of such feelings will be more likely to assent to the course of policy proposed, and so ensure the success of the speaker who recommends. It is singular however that neither of these is found in the list of <foreign lang="greek">πάθη</foreign> which follows: <foreign lang="greek">ἐπιθυμία</foreign> occurs amongst them in Eth. Nic.

In the same way <foreign lang="greek">εὔνοια</foreign>, in the three &lsquo;ethical&rsquo; virtues to be exhibited in the speech, is included in <foreign lang="greek">φιλία</foreign>. </p>

Eth., the former from the end of Book IV., where it appears with <foreign lang="greek">νέμεσις</foreign> as an appendage to the list of virtues; it is found likewise in the Rhet. II 6, under the name <foreign lang="greek">αἰσχύνη. ἐπιθυμία</foreign> is absent in the Rhetoric), <foreign lang="greek">ὅλως οἷς ἕπεται ὡς ἐπὶ τὸ πολὺ</foreign> (this is a modification of Aristotle's statement) <foreign lang="greek">ἡ αἰσθητικὴ</foreign> (this also is an addition) <foreign lang="greek">ἡδονὴ ἢ λύπη καθ’  αὑτά</foreign>. In Magn. Mor. A 7, 8, there is a summary account, borrowed directly from Aristotle, of the three elementary divisions of man's moral nature, <foreign lang="greek">πάθη δυνάμεις ἕξεις</foreign>. Of the first we find, <foreign lang="greek">πάθη μὲν οὖν ἐστὶν ὀργὴ φόβος μῖσος πόθος ζῆλος ἔλεος, τὰ τοιαῦτα, οἷς εἴωθε παρακολουθεῖν λύπη καὶ ἡδονή</foreign>, 1186 <hi rend="italic">a</hi> 12, which is afterwards thus modified, c. 8, 1186 <hi rend="italic">a</hi> 34, <foreign lang="greek">τὰ δὲ πάθη ἤτοι λῦπαί εἰσιν ἢ ἡδοναί, ἢ οὐκ ἄνευ λύπης ἢ ἡδονῆς</foreign>. These <foreign lang="greek">πάθη</foreign> proper are therefore distinguished from other <foreign lang="greek">πάθη</foreign>, feelings or affections of like nature, such as the appetites, hunger and thirst (which are also attended by pleasure and pain), not by pleasure and pain in general, as seems to be implied in the above statements, but by the particular kinds of pleasures and pains that severally accompany them; bodily in the one case, mental and moral in the other. So that the appetites belong to the body or material, the &lsquo;emotions&rsquo;, as they are now called, to the mind and the moral, immaterial, part of man; and feeling (the general term) and emotion (the special term) are thus distinguished: all emotions are feelings, all feelings are not emotions. </p>

						<p>For rhetorical purposes we must divide the examination of each <foreign lang="greek">πάθος</foreign> into three parts; the nature of them, what the disposition is in one who feels the emotion; the ordinary objects, against whom the emotion is directed (as the ordinary objects of anger); and the ordinary conditions, the occasions and circumstances which give rise to them.

						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ὄρεξις μετὰ λύπησμὴ προσήκοντος</lemma>] This definition of anger occurs likewise in the Topics, <foreign lang="greek">Θ</foreign> 156 <hi rend="italic">a</hi> 30, <foreign lang="greek">ἡ ὀργὴ ὄρεξις εἶναι τιμωρίας διὰ φαινομένην ὀλιγωρίαν</foreign>, as an average specimen of a <hi rend="italic">dialectical</hi> definition; whence no doubt it was imported into the Rhetoric. Another definition similar to this is again spoken of as popular and dialectical, and opposed to a true &lsquo;physical&rsquo; definition, de Anima 1, 403 <hi rend="italic">a</hi> 29, <foreign lang="greek">διαφερόντως δ’  ἂν ὁρίσαιντο φυσικός τε καὶ διαλεκτικὸς ἕκαστον αὐτῶν, οἷον ὀργὴ τί ἐστίν· ὁ μὲν γὰρ ὄρεξιν ἀντιλυπήσεως ἤ τι τοιοῦτον, ὁ δὲ ζέσιν τοῦ περὶ καρδίαν αἵματος καὶ θερμοῦ</foreign>; the latter is the &lsquo;appropriate&rsquo; form of definition. And Plutarch, de Virt. Mor. p. 442 B, speaks of <foreign lang="greek">ὄρεξις ἀντιλυπήσεως</foreign> in terms which seem to imply that Aristotle had himself employed as his own definition. This, says Seneca, de Ira, I 3. 3, very nearly corresponded with his own, (<hi rend="italic">cupiditas iniuriae ulciscendae</hi> I 2. 4,) <hi rend="italic">ait enim</hi> (Arist.) <hi rend="italic">iram esse cupiditatem doloris reponendi;</hi> which appears to be a translation of <foreign lang="greek">ὄρεξις ἀντιλυπήσεως</foreign>. A passage of the Eth. Nic. VII 7, 1149 <hi rend="italic">a</hi> 30, will illustrate some points of the definition of the Rhetoric. <foreign lang="greek">ὁ θυμὸς διὰ θερμότητα καὶ ταχυτῆτα...ὁρμᾷ πρὸς τὴν τιμωρίαν. ὁ μὲν γὰρ λόγος ἢ ἡ φαντασία ὅτι ὕβρις ἢ ὀλιγωρία ἐδήλωσεν, ὃ δ’  ὥσπερ συλλογισάμενος ὅτι δεῖ τῷ τοιούτῳ πολεμεῖν χαλεπαίνει δὴ εὐθύς· ἡ δ̓ ἐπιθυμία, ἐὰν μόνον εἴπῃ ὅτι ἡδὺ ὁ λόγος ἢ ἡ αἴσθησις, ὁρμᾷ πρὸς τὴν ἀπόλαυσιν</foreign>. Here two elements of anger are distinguished.

Victorius quotes the Stoic definition of anger, <foreign lang="greek">τιμωρίας ἐπιθυμία τοῦ δοκοῦντος ἠδικηκέναι οὐ προσηκόντως</foreign>, which is derived probably from this of Aristotle. <pb n="9"/> </p>
						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ὄρεξις</lemma> as a general term denotes a class of <foreign lang="greek">ὀρέξεις</foreign>, instinctive and impulsive faculties of the soul or immaterial part, intellectual as well as moral, the ultimate origin of all action in the human subject. Sir W. Hamilton, <hi rend="italic">Lect. on Metaph.</hi> I p. 185, laments the want of any corresponding word in modern psychology, and proposes to supply it by the term &lsquo;conative&rsquo; faculties. The <foreign lang="greek">ὄρεξις</foreign>, so far as it is described at all, is noticed in de Anima II 3, sub init., and afterwards more at length in III 9 and 10; compare also Eth. N. VI 2. The first of these passages enumerates the ascending stages or forms of life which characterise and distinguish the ascending orders of plants and animals. The first, <foreign lang="greek">τὸ θρεπτικόν</foreign>, the life or principle of growth and nutrition, is the lowest form, and is characteristic of plants, which have no other. The second stage in the development of life is <foreign lang="greek">τὸ αἰσθητικόν</foreign>, with which <foreign lang="greek">τὸ ὀρεκτικόν</foreign>, the ultimate origin of motion in the living animal, is inseparably connected; (sensation implies impulse) both of them being instinctive and both together constituting animal as distinguished from plant. But the lowest animals have no power of motion; consequently the next stage in the upward course is <foreign lang="greek">τὸ κινητικόν</foreign>, local motion, or locomotion in space, <foreign lang="greek">κατὰ τόπον</foreign>. The last, which is peculiar to humanity, is <foreign lang="greek">τὸ διανοητικόν</foreign>, the intellectual element, divided into <foreign lang="greek">νοῦς</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">διάνοια</foreign>. The <foreign lang="greek">ὀρεκτικόν</foreign> is here divided, 414 <hi rend="italic">b</hi> 2, into three classes of faculties, <foreign lang="greek">ἐπιθυμία</foreign> (the appetites, or sensual desires)<note anchored="yes">This reference of <foreign lang="greek">ἐπιθυμία</foreign> to the class of <foreign lang="greek">ὀρέξεις</foreign> indicates, as Plutarch, de Virt. Mor. c. 3 (ap. Heitz, <hi rend="italic">Verlor. Schrift. Arist.</hi> p. 171), has pointed out, a change in the Aristotelian psychology, from the Platonic tripartite division of the human nature, intellectual and moral, which he originally held&mdash;<foreign lang="greek">ὡς δῆλόν ἐστιν ἐξ ὧν ἔγραψεν</foreign>, i. e. in the lost dialogue <foreign lang="greek">περὶ ο͂ικαιοσύνης</foreign>, according to Heitz: the <foreign lang="greek">θυμοειδές</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">ἐπιθυμητικόν</foreign> are actually distinguished, Topic. B 7, 113 <hi rend="italic">a</hi> 36&mdash;<hi rend="italic">b</hi> 3, and <foreign lang="greek">Δ</foreign> 5, 126 <hi rend="italic">a</hi> 8&mdash;13, where we have the three, <foreign lang="greek">τὸ ἐπιθυμητικόν, τὸ θυμοειο͂ές, τὸ λογιστικόν</foreign> (in both passages <foreign lang="greek">τὸ θυμοειδές</foreign> is assigned <hi rend="italic">as the seat of</hi> <foreign lang="greek">ὀργή</foreign>); and the division is certainly implied in Polit. IV (VII) 7, 1327 <hi rend="italic">b</hi> 36, seq., where the author is criticising the Republic to the views expressed in the de Anima, in which the Platonic division is criticised, condemned, and rejected. Plutarch, l. c., p. 442 B, after the statement above quoted, continues, <foreign lang="greek">ὕστερον δὲ τὸ μὲν θυμοειδὲς τῷ ἐπιθυμητικῷ προσένειμεν, ὡς ἐπιθυμίαν τινὰ τὸν θυμὸν ὄντα καὶ ὄρεξιν ἀντιλυπήσεως</foreign>.</note>, <foreign lang="greek">θυμός</foreign> (the passions, anger, love, hatred, and all the more violent and impetuous emotions, the angry passions especially&mdash;the word is as old as Homer, a relic of antiquity, and as a psychological term very vague and indistinct), and lastly <foreign lang="greek">βούλησις</foreign>, which seems here to include &lsquo;will&rsquo; as well as &lsquo;wish&rsquo;. The will is more directly implied, though never disengaged and distinctly expressed, in the <foreign lang="greek">προαίρεσις</foreign> the moral faculty of deliberate purpose: this consists of an intellectual, and also of an impulsive element, the spontaneous origin of moral action which it is the office of the intellectual part to direct aright; the <foreign lang="greek">προαίρεσις</foreign> accordingly is <foreign lang="greek">ὄρεξις βουλευτική</foreign>, Eth. N. VI 2, 1139 <hi rend="italic">a</hi> 24, or again, <foreign lang="greek">ὀρεκτικος νους ἤ ὄρεξις διανοητική</foreign>, ib. <hi rend="italic">b</hi> 4. These two elements in combination, (the <foreign lang="greek">προαίρεσις</foreign>), are the <foreign lang="greek">ἀρχὴ πράξεως</foreign>, ib. <hi rend="italic">a</hi> 32, of which the <foreign lang="greek">ὄρεξις</foreign> (and so de Anima III 9. 2, 3, <foreign lang="greek">ἓν δὴ τὸ κινοῦν, τὸ ὀρεκτικόν</foreign>,) is the <pb n="10"/> original moving agent: and this, though not expressly so called, is in fact the will. In de Anima III cc. 9, 10, are repeated the statements of II 3, with the addition of further details. Of the three component elements of <foreign lang="greek">ὄρεξις</foreign>, the second, <foreign lang="greek">θυμός</foreign>, is omitted: and the five stages of life of the former passage still remaining five, the intellectual is now divided into two, <foreign lang="greek">τὸ νοητικόν</foreign>, and <foreign lang="greek">τὸ βουλευτικόν</foreign> (the speculative and practical reason), and the <foreign lang="greek">κινητικὸν κατὰ τόπον</foreign> has disappeared. How this division of the <foreign lang="greek">ψυχή</foreign>, soul or life, is to be reconciled with that of the Ethics II 4, into <foreign lang="greek">πάθη δυνάμεις ἕξεις</foreign>, Aristotle has not told us, and no one I believe has yet discovered.

It is because anger is an impulse towards this punishment or vengeance <hi rend="italic">that can be seen</hi>, and accompanied with pain until this impulse is quieted by satisfaction, that we are told in I 11. 9, &lsquo;that no one is angry with one who appears to be beyond the reach of his vengeance, or with those who are very far superior to him in power&rsquo;. </p>

						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ὀλιγωρίαν</lemma>] &lsquo;slight esteem or regard&rsquo;, &lsquo;slight&rsquo;. The cause of anger is stated so nearly in the same terms in Rhet. ad Alex. 34 (35). 11, <foreign lang="greek">ὀργὴν δέ</foreign> (<foreign lang="greek">ἐμποιήσομεν</foreign>), <foreign lang="greek">ἐὰν ἐπιδεικνύωμεν παρὰ τὸ προσῆκον ὠλιγωρημένους ἢ ἠδικημένους, ἢ τῶν φίλων ἐκείνων, ἢ αὐτοὺς ἢ ὧν κηδόμενοι τυγχάνουσιν αὐτοί</foreign>, that one might almost suppose that the two explanations are derived from some common source, perhaps a definition of anger current in the earlier treatises on Rhetoric, Thrasymachus' <foreign lang="greek">ἔλεοι</foreign> (Rhet. III 1. 7, Plat. Phaedr. 267 C), and the like. </p>
						<p>A valuable commentary on this explanation of the cause of anger, the coincidence between the two being manifestly accidental, is to be found in Prof. Bain's work on <hi rend="italic">The Emotions and the Will</hi>, p. 166, ch. ix. &sect; 3, on the &lsquo;irascible emotion&rsquo;. &ldquo;These two facts both pertain,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;to the nature of true anger, the discomposure of mind from the circumstance of <pb n="11"/> another man's intention in working evil against us, and the cure of this discomposure by the submission or suffering of the agent.&rdquo; I will only add one remark upon this interesting subject; that when Aristotle assigns <foreign lang="greek">ὀλιγωρία</foreign>, the contempt and indifference to our feelings and sense of personal dignity implied in the notion of &lsquo;slight&rsquo;, as the main cause of the emotion of anger, he is thinking only of the angry passion as excited against a fellow man. Yet we are angry with a dog that bites, or a cat that scratches us<note anchored="yes">On the manner in which anger vents itself upon all sorts of objects indiscriminately, see Plut. de cohibenda ira, p. 455 D, <foreign lang="greek">θυμῷ δ’  ἄθικτον οὐδὲν οὐδ̓ ἀνεπιχείρητον· ἀλλ̓ ὀργιζόμεθα καὶ πολεμίοις καὶ φίλοις καὶ τέκνοις καὶ γονεῦσι, καὶ θεοῖς νὴ Δία, καὶ θηρίοις, καὶ ἀψύχοις σκεύεσι</foreign>, which is further illustrated by some examples.</note>, and here there cannot in all cases be any sense of undeserved contempt or indifference to provoke the angry feeling; though perhaps sometimes it may be increased by such an act of aggression, if the animal happen to be a pet or favourite, in which case we may extend (by analogy) human feelings to the brute, comparing him unconsciously with a <hi rend="italic">friend</hi> who has injured us, and forgetting the intellectual and moral differences of the two, which aggravate the offence in the <hi rend="italic">human</hi> subject. Seneca denies the capacity of anger to all but man: de Ira, I 3. 4, <hi rend="italic">dicendum est feras ira carere et omnia praeter hominem.</hi> </p>
						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">τῶν εἰς αὐτὸν</lemma> (&lsquo;him&rsquo; i. e. <foreign lang="greek">αὑτόν</foreign>, &lsquo;himself&rsquo;) <foreign lang="greek">ἢ τῶν αὐτοῦ</foreign>] This phrase, which is unusually elliptical&mdash;even for Aristotle&mdash;must it seems be thus filled up and explained. <foreign lang="greek">τῶν εἰς αὐτόν</foreign> means <foreign lang="greek">τῶν ἀδικηθέντων</foreign> or simply <foreign lang="greek">πραχθέντων εἰς αὐτόν</foreign>, &lsquo;offences or acts committed against oneself&rsquo;, and <foreign lang="greek">ὀλιγωρίαν τῶν</foreign> is, &lsquo;slight or contemptuous indifference <hi rend="italic">of</hi>, i. e. shewn in, evidenced by, offences &amp;c.&rsquo;: in supplying the ellipse in the other part of the phrase, <foreign lang="greek">ἢ τῶν αὐτοῦ</foreign>, we are guided by a similar expression, c. 8 &sect; 7, <foreign lang="greek">συμβεβηκότα ἢ αὑτῷ</foreign> (so the MSS here) <foreign lang="greek">ἢ τῶν αὑτοῦ, ἢ ἐλπίσαι γενέσθαι ἢ αὑτῷ ἢ τῶν αὑτοῦ</foreign>; in both of them the indef. pronoun is omitted, <foreign lang="greek">ἤ τινα τῶν αὐτοῦ</foreign> in c. 2. 1, and <foreign lang="greek">τινί</foreign> in the two other places. </p>
						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">τοῦ ὀλιγωρεῖν μὴ προσήκοντος</lemma><note anchored="yes" n="2">This appears likewise in the Stoic definition quoted above. I believe it has not hitherto been noticed that the four terms usually employed in Greek to express the notion of duty or obligation may be distinguished as implying four different sources of obligation, and represent appeals to four different principles by which our actions are guided. The four are <foreign lang="greek">προσήκει, δεῖ, χρή, πρέπει</foreign>. The first, <foreign lang="greek">τὸ προσῆκον</foreign>, expresses a natural connexion or relationship, and hence a law of <hi rend="italic">nature</hi>, the prescriptions of <foreign lang="greek">φύσις</foreign>; as <foreign lang="greek">οἱ προσήκοντες</foreign> are our <hi rend="italic">natural relations.</hi> This, therefore, is the form of obligation that nature imposes upon us, or natural propriety. The second, <foreign lang="greek">δεῖ</foreign>, is of course connected with <foreign lang="greek">δεῖν</foreign>, &lsquo;to bind&rsquo;, and <foreign lang="greek">δεσμός</foreign>, and denotes the &lsquo;binding nature of an ob-<hi rend="italic">ligation</hi>&rsquo;, which is equally suggested by the Lat. ob<hi rend="italic">ligatio.</hi> <foreign lang="greek">τὸ δέον</foreign> is therefore the <hi rend="italic">moral bond</hi>, the <hi rend="italic">binding</hi> engagement, by which we are <hi rend="italic">bound</hi> to do what is right. The third, <foreign lang="greek">χρή, τὸ χρεών</foreign>, appeals to the principle of utility or expediency, <foreign lang="greek">χρῆσθαι, χρεία</foreign>, by which human conduct is directed as a principle of action, and accordingly expresses the obligation of a man's duty to himself, and the necessary regard for his own interest which the law of self-preservation requires. Besides these, we have <foreign lang="greek">πρέπει, τὸ πρέπον</foreign>; <hi rend="italic">decorum, quod decet</hi>, Cic. de Off. 1. 27, <hi rend="italic">quod</hi> aptum <hi rend="italic">est in omni vita;</hi> the befitting, the becoming; which represents the general notion of <hi rend="italic">fitness</hi> or <hi rend="italic">propriety:</hi> that principle of <foreign lang="greek">ἁρμονία</foreign> or <foreign lang="greek">κοσμιότης</foreign> (and the <foreign lang="greek">κόσμος</foreign>), of harmony and adaptation, which Dr Clarke selected as the basis of all morality, and styled &lsquo;the fitness of things&rsquo;. Our English words <hi rend="italic">ought</hi> and <hi rend="italic">duty</hi>, expressive of moral obligation in general, are both of them borrowed from the notion of &lsquo;a debt,&rsquo; which is &lsquo;owed&rsquo; in the one case, and &lsquo;due&rsquo; from us in the other, to our neighbour; comp. <foreign lang="greek">ὀφείλειν, ὤφελον</foreign>. &ldquo;Owe no man any thing, but to love one another.&rdquo;</note>, the last term of the definition, adds to <pb n="12"/> the offence at the slight which provokes anger the consciousness or feeling that the slight is something which is not our <hi rend="italic">due:</hi> by a slight the sense of personal dignity is offended: we know that we do not deserve it, and are the more enraged. This is a necessary qualification&mdash;a <foreign lang="greek">συμβεβηκὸς καθ’  αὑτό</foreign>, and therefore added to the <hi rend="italic">definition</hi>&mdash;because there may be cases in which an insult or injury arouses no angry feeling, when the person insulted is very far inferior in rank and condition to the offender or of a very abject and submissive temper, or if the power of the aggressor is so great and imposing, that the injured person is terrified and daunted instead of angry, II 3. 10. So at least Aristotle: but I am more inclined to agree with Seneca on this point, who to a supposed objection to his definition, <hi rend="italic">cupiditas ulciscendi</hi>, replies thus, de Ira, I 3. 2, <hi rend="italic">Primum diximus cupiditatem esse poenae exigendae, non facultatem: concupiscunt autem komines et quae non possunt. Deinde nemo tam humilis est, qui poenam vel summi hominis sperare non possit: ad nocendum potentes sumus.</hi> And anger is apt to be blind and unreasonable. This is an answer to I 11. 9, already referred to. </p>
						<p>The definition therefore of anger in full, is as follows: &lsquo;an impulsive desire, accompanied by pain (and also pleasure, as is afterwards added), of vengeance (punishment of, and compensation for, an offence) visible or evident (in its result), due to a manifest (and unmistakeable) slight (consisting, or shewn) in (insults, indignities, wrongs) directed against ourselves, or (any) of our friends, when (we feel that) the slight is undeserved&rsquo;; or literally, &lsquo;is not naturally and properly belonging to us&rsquo;, not our <hi rend="italic">due</hi>, in consideration of our rank and importance or of our personal merits and qualifications. </p>
						<p>Bacon's Essay, <hi rend="italic">Of Anger</hi>, has one point at least in common with Aristotle's delineation of it. &ldquo;The causes and motives of anger are chiefly three. First to be too sensible of <hi rend="italic">hurt;</hi> for no man is angry that feels not himself hurt... The next is, the apprehension and construction of the injury offered to be, in the circumstances thereof, full of <hi rend="italic">contempt:</hi> for contempt is that which putteth an edge upon anger, as much or more than the hurt itself.&rdquo; &ldquo;For raising and appeasing anger in another; it is done chiefly by choosing of times, when men are forwardest and worst disposed, to incense them. Again, by gathering all that you can find out to aggravate the contempt.&rdquo; </p>
					</div3>
					<div3 id="b2c2s2" type="section" n="2">
						<p>Anger is directed against the individual, not the <hi rend="italic">genus</hi> or <hi rend="italic">species</hi> (comp. c. 3. 16): that is, it is excited by a definite, concrete, single individual, and by a distinct provocation, not by a mere mental abstraction, or a whole class of objects. This is one of the characteristics which distinguish it from <foreign lang="greek">μῖσος</foreign> or <foreign lang="greek">ἔχθρα</foreign>; <hi rend="italic">infra</hi> c. 4, <foreign lang="greek">καὶ ὴ̔ μὲν ὀργὴ ἀεὶ περὶ τὰ καθ̓</foreign> <pb n="13"/> <foreign lang="greek">ἕκαστα, οἷον Καλλίᾳ ἢ Σωκράτει, τὸ δὲ μῖσος καὶ πρὸς τὰ γένῃ τὸν γὰρ κλέπτην μισεῖ καὶ τὸν συκοφάντην ἅπας</foreign>. [For <foreign lang="greek">Κλέωνι</foreign>, see III 5. 2.] Add to these, national antipathies, family feuds, class prejudices, religious and political enmities, the <hi rend="italic">odium theologicum</hi>, &amp;c. On the ordinary <hi rend="italic">objects</hi> of anger, Prof. Bain says, <hi rend="italic">Emotions and Will</hi>, p. 163, &ldquo;The <hi rend="italic">objects</hi> of irascible feeling are chiefly persons; but inanimate things may occasionally cause an imperfect form of it to arise.&rdquo; Aristotle omits this. Mr Bain, more correctly than Aristotle, includes under the same head, &lsquo;the irascible emotion&rsquo;, hatred, revenge, antipathy and resentment, or righteous indignation (<foreign lang="greek">νέμεσις</foreign>) with anger, as mere varieties of the same <foreign lang="greek">πάθος</foreign> or emotion. </p>
						<p>Again, it is provoked by any injury (or insult) committed or intended, <foreign lang="greek">ἢ πεποίηκέ τις ἢ ἤμελλεν</foreign>, either against ourselves, or any of our relations, friends, dependants, anyone in whose welfare we are interested. </p>
						<p>&lsquo;Thirdly, (as we gather from the terms of the definition, <foreign lang="greek">ὄρεξις τιμωρίας</foreign>,) every angry emotion is accompanied by a feeling of pleasure, that, namely (<foreign lang="greek">τὴν</foreign> Bekk. <foreign lang="greek">τῆς</foreign> A^{c}), which arises from the hope of vengeance upon, or of punishing (both are included in <foreign lang="greek">τιμωρία</foreign>), (the person who has offended us)&rsquo;. First of all revenge is in itself pleasant: <foreign lang="greek">καὶ τὸ τιμωρεῖσθαι ἡδύ· οὗ γὰρ τὸ μὴ τυγχάνειν λυπηρὸν τὸ τυγχάνειν ἡδύ· οἱ δ’  ὀργιζόμενοι λυποῦνται ἀνυπερβλήτως μὴ τιμωρούμενοι, ἐλπίζοντες δὲ χαίρουσιν</foreign>. Comp. Eth. Nic. IV 11, 1126 <hi rend="italic">a</hi> 2, <foreign lang="greek">ἡ γὰρ τιμωρία παύει τῆς ὀργῆς, ἡδονὴν ἀντὶ τῆς λύπης ἐμποιοῦσα. τούτου δὲ μὴ γενομένου τὸ βάρος ἔχουσιν</foreign>. &lsquo;For it is pleasant to think that we shall attain to the object of our desire&rsquo;, (the pleasure of hope or anticipation, I 11. 6, 7,) &lsquo;and no one ever aims at what is evidently impossible for himself (to attain), and the angry man's desire always aims at what he (believes to be) possible for <hi rend="italic">himself</hi>&rsquo;. He always supposes that he <hi rend="italic">shall</hi> obtain the object of his desire, the punishment of the offender, and <hi rend="italic">therefore</hi> even in his anger he feels pleasure in the prospective satisfaction. The first of the two following lines of Homer, Il. <foreign lang="greek">Σ</foreign> 109, has been already quoted in illustration of the same topic, the pleasure of anger in the prospect of revenge, I 11. 9. In the passage quoted above from Seneca, de Ira, I 3. 2, what is here said, <foreign lang="greek">οὐδεὶς τῶν φαινομένων ἀδυνάτων ἐφίεται αὑτῷ</foreign>, may seem at first sight to be contradicted. The two statements are however different: Seneca says that a man may <hi rend="italic">wish</hi> for what is quite beyond his reach; Aristotle says that he never <hi rend="italic">aims at it</hi>, never uses any exertion to attain to that which he knows to be <pb n="14"/> <hi rend="italic">un</hi>attainable: which is equally true. No one ever deliberates about things which are not under his own control. (For a list of such things see Eth. Nic. III 5, sub init.) </p>
						<p>But this anticipation of the <hi rend="italic">future</hi> is not the only source of the pleasure which we feel in an angry mood: &lsquo;it as accompanied by yet another pleasure, the <hi rend="italic">present</hi> pleasure of dwelling in the mind on the prospective vengeance: it is the fancy that then arises (presents itself) that produces the pleasure in us, just like that of dreams&rsquo;. On the pleasures of the <foreign lang="greek">φαντασία</foreign>, and the <foreign lang="greek">φαντασία</foreign> itself, see again I 11. 6, 7, and the notes there. </p>
						<p>Schrader refers to an excellent illustration of this pleasure of dwelling on the prospect of vengeance, in Terent. Adelph. III 2. 12, seq. beginning, <hi rend="italic">me miserum, vix sum compos animi, ita ardeo iracundia</hi><note anchored="yes">See also &lsquo;on the pleasure of irascible emotion,&rsquo; Bain, <hi rend="italic">Emotions and Will</hi>, c. ix. &sect; 4. Mr Bain acknowledges, though he regards it as anomalous, the painful fact that pleasure at the sight of suffering inflicted, especially under circumstances of violent excitement when the passions are already inflamed, as at the sack of a captured town, is in reality a phenomenon of human nature. Other examples of this are the notoriously cruel habits of children in their treatment of animals, and in their ordinary sports; the pleasure found in gladiatorial combats, bull fights, bear baiting, cock and quail fights, and all the other cruel exhibitions which have <hi rend="italic">amused</hi> the most civilized as well as barbarous spectators. He traces this to three sources, of which the principal is the love of power. I will venture to add three more possible elements of the emotion, which may contribute, without superseding the others, to the production of it. First, the sense of contrast between the suffering which we are witnessing in another and our own present immunity: this is the principle implied in Lucretius' <hi rend="italic">Suave mari magno</hi>, and is illustrated in I 11. 8, of this work. Secondly, it may be partly traced to curiosity&mdash;the pleasure of learning, as Aristotle calls it&mdash;and the stimulus of surprise or wonder which we feel at any exciting spectacle; another source of pleasure mentioned by Aristotle in the same chapter. And thirdly, <hi rend="italic">perhaps</hi>, a distorted and perverted sympathy (this is an ordinary source of pleasure), which gives us an <hi rend="italic">independent interest</hi> in the sufferings of any creature whose feelings, and consequent liability to suffering, we share&mdash;that is, of all <hi rend="italic">animated</hi> beings; with inanimate objects there can be no sympathy.</note>. </p>

					<div3 id="b2c2s3" type="section" n="3">
						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ἐπεὶ δ̓</lemma>] has either no apodosis at all&mdash;which is highly probable in itself, and seems to be Bekker's view, who retains the full stop at <foreign lang="greek">ὑπολαμβάνομεν</foreign>: or else we may suppose with Vater that the apodosis is <foreign lang="greek">τρία δ’  ἐστίν</foreign>...; in which case <foreign lang="greek">δὲ</foreign> may be added to the examples of the apodotic <foreign lang="greek">δὲ</foreign> in note on I 1. 11, or omitted with MSS Q, Y^{b}, Z^{b}. According to Vater's view the connexion will be, that whereas <foreign lang="greek">ὀλιγωρία</foreign> is an expression of contempt for somebody or something supposed to be worthless, whether it be so or not in reality, there are accordingly three kinds of <foreign lang="greek">ὀλιγωρία</foreign> each expressing contempt, but in three different forms, or modes of manifestation. To the three kinds of <foreign lang="greek">ὀλιγωρία</foreign> here distinguished <foreign lang="greek">ἀναι-</foreign> <pb n="15"/> <foreign lang="greek">σχυντία</foreign> is added in c. 6 &sect; 2. In Dem. de F. L. &sect; 228 it follows <foreign lang="greek">ἀναιδεία</foreign> as its ordinary companion (compare Shilleto's note). </p>
						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ἐνέργεια δόξης</lemma>] represents the opinion, hitherto dormant or latent, as roused into active exercise as a realised capacity, a <foreign lang="greek">δύναμις</foreign> become an <foreign lang="greek">ἐνέργεια</foreign>. The mere opinion of the worthlessness of so and so, has now become developed into <foreign lang="greek">ὀλιγωρία</foreign>, and assumed the form of an active or <hi rend="italic">actual</hi> expression of the contempt by the outward token of &lsquo;slight regard&rsquo;. </p>
						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ὀλιγωρία</lemma> therefore shews &lsquo;indifference&rsquo;, as to something that we do not care for at all, or regard as something so contemptible, so devoid of all positive character, that it is not worth forming an opinion about: what is positively good or bad is always worthy of &lsquo;earnest attention&rsquo;, or &lsquo;serious anxiety.&rsquo; On <foreign lang="greek">σπουδή</foreign> &lsquo;earnest&rsquo;, as opposed to <foreign lang="greek">παιδιά</foreign> &lsquo;sport&rsquo; (Plat. Phaedr. 276 D, compared with E, Rep. X 602 B, alibi), and on <foreign lang="greek">σπουδαῖος</foreign> &lsquo;serious&rsquo;, &lsquo;earnest&rsquo;, &lsquo;of solid worth or value&rsquo;, opposed to <foreign lang="greek">φαῦλος</foreign> &lsquo;light&rsquo;, &lsquo;trifling&rsquo;, &lsquo;frivolous&rsquo;, &lsquo;unsubstantial&rsquo;, &lsquo;worthless&rsquo;, and hence <hi rend="italic">morally</hi> &lsquo;good&rsquo; and &lsquo;bad&rsquo;, see note on I 5. 8. </p>
						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">καὶ τὰ συντείνοντα</lemma>] &lsquo;as well as everything that has that tendency&rsquo;; viz. to good and bad. &lsquo;There are three kinds of slight, or contemptuous indifference, contempt, spite and wanton outrage&rsquo;. First, &lsquo;contempt involves <foreign lang="greek">ὀλιγωρία</foreign>; because people <hi rend="italic">despise</hi> men and things that they regard as <hi rend="italic">worthless</hi>, and <foreign lang="greek">ὀλιγωρία</foreign>, slight esteem, contemptuous indifference, is directed to the same objects&rsquo;, whence it appears that they have a common element, and that <foreign lang="greek">καταφρόνησις</foreign> is <foreign lang="greek">ὀλιγωρία τις</foreign>, a <hi rend="italic">kind</hi> of slight. </p>
					</div3>
					<div3 id="b2c2s4" type="section" n="4">
						<p>A second kind of <foreign lang="greek">ὀλιγωρία</foreign> is <foreign lang="greek">ἐπηρεασμός</foreign>, spiteful opposition to, <hi rend="italic">wanton</hi> interference with, the plans and wishes (<foreign lang="greek">ταις βουλήσεσι</foreign>) of others, in order to thwart them, where you gain no advantage to yourself by doing so; where the motive is the mere malicious pleasure of disconcerting some one, and thereby shewing your power over them: which is the root of the wanton love of mischief inherent in human nature: comp. &sect; 6. &lsquo;This is an inclination to <hi rend="italic">thwart</hi> or interfere with the wishes of another, not for any advantage that you expect to derive from it yourself, but merely for the mischievous satisfaction of depriving him of it. The slight regard therefore is shewn in the wantonness of the offence; for it is plain that there is no intention (<hi rend="italic">lit.</hi> supposition) of injury in a slight&mdash; that would imply fear, not merely indifference&mdash;nor of doing him any service, none at least worth speaking of&rsquo; (<foreign lang="greek">ὀλιγωρία</foreign> excludes the notion of good as well as bad, it is mere indifference; &sect; 3, <foreign lang="greek">καὶ γὰρ τὰ κακὰ καὶ τἀγαθὰ ἄξια οἰόμεθα σπουδῆς εἶναι κ.τ.λ.</foreign>); &lsquo;for <hi rend="italic">this</hi> (doing him service) would imply care for him, solicitude for his welfare, and <hi rend="italic">that</hi> again <pb n="16"/> friendship,&rsquo; <hi rend="italic">lit.</hi> &lsquo;for (in that case) he would have shewn that he cared for him, and therefore (so that <foreign lang="greek">ὥστε</foreign>. it would follow) that he was his friend&rsquo;. The argument of <foreign lang="greek">ἐπεὶ οὖνφίλος εἶναι</foreign> is this. The <hi rend="italic">wantonness</hi> of the mischief which is the effect of <foreign lang="greek">ἐπηρεασμός</foreign>, (spiteful interference with your neighbour's inclinations,) shews that <foreign lang="greek">ὀλιγωρία</foreign> enters into it in this, that it must proceed from a contemptuous indifference as to the person and character of the victim; for the very wantonness of the act, that it is done for mere amusement, and without any prospect of advantage, shews the slight regard that the perpetrator has for the sufferer; that he neither fears him as he must have done if he wished to hurt or injure him by thwarting his schemes, nor esteems and respects him as a friend, as would necessarily be the case if he intended to interfere with and oppose his plans and inclinations for the other's benefit: and therefore the indifference that he does manifest must be indicative of contempt. </p>
						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ἐπηρεασμός</lemma>] appears to be almost a <foreign lang="greek">ἅπαξ λεγόμενον</foreign>; only two examples are given in Steph. Lex., one from Diodorus and the other from Pollux&mdash;no great authorities. [It is also found <hi rend="italic">infra</hi> c. 4 &sect; 30.] The usual form of it in the ordinary language is <foreign lang="greek">ἐπήρεια</foreign>, which occurs in much the same sense; as also <foreign lang="greek">ἐπηρεάζειν</foreign> frequently in Demosthenes, and less frequently elsewhere, as in Xenophon and the Comic Poets. Thucyd. I 26 is a good instance as a commentary upon Aristotle's text, and illustrative of his interpretation: of the Corcyreans, during their war with the Corinthians, it is said that after the surrender of their colony Epidamnus to the Corinthians, they took this to heart, and despatched a force of 25 ships, to demand amongst other things the restitution of the Epidamnian exiles; and this they did <foreign lang="greek">κατ’  ἐπήρειαν</foreign>, &lsquo;they bade them <hi rend="italic">out of mere spite and wantonness</hi>&rsquo; without any prospect of benefit to themselves, merely for the purpose of annoying the others. Comp. <foreign lang="greek">ἐπηρεάζειν</foreign>, Dem. c. Mid. p. 519, of Midias' vexatious annoyance, <foreign lang="greek">ἐπήρεια</foreign> ib. p. 522 ult. where it is distinguished from <foreign lang="greek">ὕβρις</foreign>, the wanton outrage on the sacred <hi rend="italic">person</hi> of the choragus. See also de Cor. p. 229, lines 8, 14 in both of which it is applied to spiteful, wantonly offensive <hi rend="italic">language;</hi> whereas in Aristotle it is <foreign lang="greek">ἐμποδισμὸς ταῖς βουλήσεσιν</foreign>, and in Plut. Reip. Ger. Praec. p. 816 C, it is applied to <hi rend="italic">acts</hi> of this character, <foreign lang="greek">ἢ πράξεσιν ἐχούσαις φιλοτιμίαν ἐπηρεάζων</foreign>; as in Ar. Pol.

In Plut. Coriol. 334 D, <foreign lang="greek">οὐκ ἐπὶ κέρδεσιν ἀλλὰ δἰ ὕβριν καὶ περιφρόνησιν τοῖς πένησιν ἐπηρεάζων</foreign>, which marks the wanton character of the acts of oppression. These passages from Plutarch with some others from the same author are to be found in Wyttenbach's note on Plutarch, p. 135 D. He renders it <hi rend="italic">vexantes, infestantes, per invidiam et contumeliam.</hi> The only other instance that I will refer to, occurs in Herod.

But by comparing the word as here used with its use and explanation in other authors, we see that the sense of <hi rend="italic">the threat</hi> is only <pb n="17"/> implied, and that the prominent and characteristic signification is, as elsewhere, &lsquo;insult or spite them by telling them the fate that will overtake them&rsquo;. </p>
						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ὥστε φίλος εἶναι</lemma>] is an instance of a not unfrequent attraction of a substantive or adjective, ordinarily in the accusative, within a grammatical bracket, as it were, to the subject of the verb without it&mdash;here <foreign lang="greek">ἐφρόντιζε</foreign>&mdash;and hence expressed in the nominative.

						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ὕβρις</lemma>] which corresponds with the preceding in some points, while it differs in others, is &lsquo;an injury or annoyance inflicted, involving disgrace to the sufferer; for no <hi rend="italic">benefit</hi> that is expected to accrue to the aggressor except the mere fact of its having been done, in other words the <hi rend="italic">pleasure</hi> of doing it: for <hi rend="italic">retaliation</hi> is not wanton outrage but vengeance or punishment&rsquo;. This is the <hi rend="italic">locus classicus</hi> for the explanation of <foreign lang="greek">ὕβρις</foreign>, so important in the Orators and the Athenian law. See note on I 12. 26, where it is examined from this point of view. The outraged personal dignity, the wounded honour, which gives its special sting to an act of <foreign lang="greek">ὕβρις</foreign>, and distinguishes it from a mere assault, <foreign lang="greek">αἰκία</foreign>, is noted in the text by the phrase <foreign lang="greek">ἐφ’  οἷς αἰσχύνη ἐστὶ τῷ πάσχοντι</foreign>, and the rest of the definition describes the &lsquo;wantonness&rsquo; of the aggression, which <foreign lang="greek">ὕβρις</foreign> has in common with <foreign lang="greek">ἐπηρεασμός</foreign>, and in which the <foreign lang="greek">ὀλιγωρία</foreign> is shewn. Compare I 13. 10, where the two same characteristics of <foreign lang="greek">ὕβρις</foreign> reappear; <foreign lang="greek">οὐ γὰρ εἰ ἐπάταξε πάντως ὕβρισεν, ἀλλ’  εἰ ἕνεκά του, οἷον τοῦ ἀτιμάσαι ἐκεῖνον ἢ αὐτὸς ἡσθῆναι. ὕβρις</foreign> therefore is wanton outrage, an insult or injury which disgraces and humiliates its victim, and is prompted by no motive but the mere momentary gratification of humiliating another and therein indulging the love and the sense of power. Some illustrations of acts of <foreign lang="greek">ὕβρις</foreign> are to be found in Polit. VIII (V), 10, 1311 <hi rend="italic">a</hi> 33. Personal outrage, <foreign lang="greek">ἐπὶ τὸ σῶμα</foreign>, is one of the causes of conspiracy and revolution. <foreign lang="greek">τῆς δ’  ὕβρεως οὔσης πολυμεροῦς, ἕκαστον αὐτῶν αἴτιον γίνεται τῆς ὀργῆς· τῶν δ̓ ὀργιζομένων σχεδὸν οἱ πλεῖστοι τιμωρίας χάριν ἐπιτίθενται, ἀλλ̓ οὐχ ὑπεροχῆς, οἷον κ.τ.λ.</foreign> and then follows a number of examples. It is plain however from a comparison of this with what immediately follows in the Rhet. &sect; 6, where <foreign lang="greek">ὕβρις</foreign> is traced to the love of <foreign lang="greek">ὑπεροχή</foreign>, that the <foreign lang="greek">ὕβρις</foreign> here spoken of is confined to insults or outrages of a particular kind, offered to the <hi rend="italic">person</hi>, <foreign lang="greek">εἰς τὸ σῶμα</foreign>. <pb n="18"/> </p>

This character and tendency of youth is also expressed in one of the two opposite senses of the derivatives <foreign lang="greek">νεανίας, νεανιεύεσθαι, νεανικός</foreign>. The two last convey, in different contexts, the two sides of the youthful character, and the good and bad qualities by which it is specially distinguished. On the one hand, they represent the gallant, spirited, vigorous, impetuous, nature of youth (<foreign lang="greek">εὖ καὶ γενναίως, ἅτε νέος ὤν</foreign>, Plat. Soph. 239 B), on the other the petulousness, wantonness, insolence, which sometimes characterises it&mdash;<hi rend="italic">protervus, ferox, superbus</hi>, Ast, <hi rend="italic">Lex. Plat.</hi> s. v. <foreign lang="greek">νεανικός</foreign>. Both senses are abundantly illustrated in Plato. I will only quote Soph. 239 D, <foreign lang="greek">τί τις τῷ νεανίᾳ</foreign> (this audacious, impertinent, youngster) <foreign lang="greek">πρὸς τὸ ἐρωτώμενον ἀποκρινεῖται</foreign>. See Heindorf ad loc. who refers to Eur. Suppl. 580, Arist. Vesp. 1333, and interprets the word &lsquo;de homine feroci insolentique&rsquo;; and <foreign lang="greek">νεανιεύεσθαι</foreign>, as exemplified in Lysias&rsquo; speech (Phaedr. 235 A), which &lsquo;ran riot&rsquo;, &lsquo;passed all bounds of moderation&rsquo; in the endeavour to shew, &amp;c.; and (according to Callicles, Gorg. 482 C) in that of Socrates, who had been talking like a mob-orator, &lsquo;running riot, luxuriating in language full of exaggeration, extravagance.&rsquo; So that &lsquo;to play the youth, act like a young man&rsquo;, sometimes means rash and arrogant, wanton, insolent, overbearing, extravagant, licentious conduct. The examples of both these words in Demosthenes display a leaning towards the more favourable view of the youthful character. &mdash;Plat.

And again &sect; 4, like the <foreign lang="greek">νέοι, ἀδικήματα ἀδικοῦσιν οὐ κακουργικὰ ἀλλὰ τὰ μὲν ὑβριστικὰ τὰ δὲ ἀκρατευτικά</foreign>. In applying the doctrine of the &lsquo;mean&rsquo; to the various orders of population, with the view of determining the best form of government, Aristotle makes the following remark, Polit. VI (IV) 11, 1295 <hi rend="italic">b</hi> 6, all excess and defect is injurious; <foreign lang="greek">ὑπέρκαλον δὲ ἢ ὑπερίσχυρον ἢ ὑπερευγενῆ ἢ ὑπερπλούσιον, ἢ τἀναντία τούτοις, ὑπέρπτωχον ἢ ὑπερασθενῆ καὶ σφόδρα ἄτιμον, χαλεπὸν τῷ λόγῳ ἀκολουθεῖν. γίγνονται γὰρ οἱ μὲν ὑβρισταὶ καὶ μεγαλοπόνηροι μᾶλλον, οἱ δὲ κακοῦργοι καὶ μικροπόνηροι λίαν· τῶν δ’  ἀδικημά-</foreign> <pb n="19"/> <foreign lang="greek">των τὰ μὲν γίγνεται δἰ ὕβριν τὰ δὲ διὰ κακουργίαν</foreign>: where we have again the same distinction of crimes as in the two passages of the Rhetoric already quoted, II 12. 15, and 16.4; and a third time 13. 14, where the opposite &mdash;<foreign lang="greek">εἰς κακουργίαν, οὐκ εἰς ὕβριν</foreign>&mdash;is said of old men. Crimes are hereby divided into two classes, crimes on a great and on a petty scale; highminded crimes of violence and audacity, outrages which imply a sense of power and superiority in those who commit them; and sneaking, underhand crimes, of fraud and low villany, which are the crimes which the poor and mean are especially inclined to. </p>
						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ὑπερέχειν γὰρ οἴονται ὑβρίζοντες</lemma>] This, as we have already seen, is a general tendency of human nature: but besides this general inclination, there is in the case of the young a special desire and a special inclination to assert their superiority to others, which is shewn in the love of <hi rend="italic">victory</hi>, or getting the better of an opponent in the mimic combats and contests of their <hi rend="italic">games;</hi> and also in their love of honour or spirit of ambition; <foreign lang="greek">ὑπεροχῆς γὰρ ἐπιθυμεῖ ἡ νεότης, ἡ δὲ νίκη ὑπεροχή τις</foreign>, II 12. 6. </p>
						<p>&lsquo;Again, <foreign lang="greek">ὕβρις</foreign> is a mark of disrespect, inflicts disgrace or indignity, and this again is a mark of slight esteem; and this feeling of disrespect, and the disgrace and dishonour to the sufferer that accompany it, shew that the object of them is considered of no worth or value, because he has no <hi rend="italic">honour</hi> (but the contrary), which is as much as to say that he is of no <hi rend="italic">value</hi> (<foreign lang="greek">τιμή</foreign> having the double sense), worth nothing either for good or for evil&rsquo;, and <hi rend="italic">therefore</hi> is the object of the contemptuous <hi rend="italic">indifference</hi> which is the sting of <foreign lang="greek">ὀλιγωρία</foreign>. </p>
						<p>This disgrace and indignity is then illustrated by two lines of Homer Il. A 356, repeated in I (IX) 367, and I (IX) 648 (644), in which the angry Achilles expresses his indignation at the <hi rend="italic">slight</hi> put upon him by Agamemnon, &lsquo;who had taken and kept for himself (<foreign lang="greek">αὐτὸς ἔχει</foreign>) the present (gift of honour, one of the <foreign lang="greek">μέρη τιμῆς</foreign>; see note on <foreign lang="greek">γέρα</foreign>, I 5. 9, p. 85) of which he had deprived him&rsquo;; and had treated him &lsquo;like some despised alien or vagabond&rsquo;. <foreign lang="greek">μετανάστης</foreign>, comp. Il. II (XVI) 59, where the line is repeated, properly a &lsquo;settler in a foreign land&rsquo;, like the <foreign lang="greek">μέτοικοι</foreign> at Athens, a despised class without civil rights, and therefore <foreign lang="greek">ἀτίμητοι</foreign>; Ar.

						<p>So far of the <hi rend="italic">subjects</hi> of anger; next of its <hi rend="italic">objects.</hi> </p>
						<p>First, anger is provoked by ridicule (contempt expressed in laughter), mockery, jeering; all of which imply <foreign lang="greek">ὕβρις</foreign>, a wanton unprovoked attack upon a man's feelings and personal dignity. </p>
						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">χλευάζειν</lemma>, probably connected with <foreign lang="greek">χεῖλος</foreign> or <foreign lang="greek">χέλος</foreign> (<foreign lang="greek">χελύνη</foreign>) &lsquo;the lip&rsquo; (so Valck.), &lsquo;to shoot out the lips&rsquo; in mockery and derision. Compare the analogous <foreign lang="greek">ἐρεσχελεῖν</foreign> which may <hi rend="italic">possibly</hi> be <foreign lang="greek">ἐρέσοειν χέλος</foreign> expressing the same action. <foreign lang="greek">χλευάζειν, χλευασμός</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">χλευασία</foreign>, appear frequently in Demosth. and occasionally in other authors: in Rhet. II 3. 9 we find <foreign lang="greek">χλευαστής</foreign>. In Top. Z 6, 144 <hi rend="italic">a</hi> 5, we have <foreign lang="greek">καθάπερ οἱ τὸν προπηλακισμὸν ὕβριν μετὰ χλευασίας ὁριζόμενοι· ἡ γὰρ χλευασία ὕβρις τις, ὥστ’  οὐ διαφορὰ ἀλλ̓ εἶδος ἡ χλευασία. χλευασία</foreign> therefore is a &lsquo;kind&rsquo; of <foreign lang="greek">ὕβρις</foreign>, which exactly corresponds with the view of it taken here. </p>
						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">σκώπτειν</lemma>, is not easily distinguished from the preceding, except by the greater frequency of its occurrence. It expresses an ill-natured joke, sneering, taunting, gibing at, another, for the purpose of bringing him into ridicule. This is the &lsquo;scornful jest&rsquo;, which, as Pope says, is &lsquo;most bitter&rsquo;. <foreign lang="greek">σκῶμμα</foreign> or <foreign lang="greek">σκῶψις</foreign> is therefore opposed to <foreign lang="greek">εὐτραπελία</foreign>, the easy well-bred pleasantry which distinguishes the conversation and compoposition of the accomplished gentleman. The ill-natured intention implied in <foreign lang="greek">σκώπτειν</foreign> appears incidentally in the phrase <foreign lang="greek">λυπεῖν τὸν σκωπτόμενον</foreign>, which indicates that it is always attended with pain to the object of it, Eth. N. IV 14, 1128 <hi rend="italic">a</hi> 7: and again this its <hi rend="italic">ordinary</hi> character appears Ib. line 25, seq. <foreign lang="greek">πότερον οὖν τὸν εὖ σκώπτοντα ὁριστέον τῷ λέγειν ἃ πρέπει ἐλευθερίῳ, ἢ τῷ μὴ λυπεῖν τὸν ἀκούοντα ἢ καὶ τέρπειν</foreign>; (neither of which evidently belonged to the ordinary character and operation of the <foreign lang="greek">σκῶμμα</foreign>), and again, line 30, <foreign lang="greek">τὸ γὰρ σκῶμμα λοιδόρημά τι ἐστίν</foreign>. I suppose that the difference between this and <foreign lang="greek">χλευασμός</foreign> must be something of this kind: <foreign lang="greek">χλευάζειν</foreign> &lsquo;mockery&rsquo; may be conveyed by the gesture or tone of voice or the manner as well as by the actual words, and is therefore the more general expression of contempt as conveyed by language or manner: in <foreign lang="greek">σκῶμμα</foreign> the contempt is conveyed or embodied in a joke or taunting phrase. It occurs, as might be expected, constantly in Aristophanes, who dealt more largely in the commodity itself than most other writers. An examination of the passages where it is used by this author will help to confirm what I have said of the ill-natured use of it; for instance, Pac. 740, <foreign lang="greek">ἐς τὰ ῥάκια σκώπτοντας ἀεὶ καὶ τοῖς φθειρσὶν πολεμοῦντας</foreign>, Nub. 540, <foreign lang="greek">οὐδ’  ἔσκωπτε τοὺς φαλακρούς</foreign>, and so of the rest. </p>
						<p>A second class of persons who are special objects of angry feeling, are &lsquo;those who inflict such injuries as bear upon them the marks of wanton outrage. These must be such as are neither in retaliation (for an injury already inflicted on the aggressor) nor beneficial to those who inflict them; <pb n="25"/> for when this is the case&rsquo; (by this time, now at length; note on <foreign lang="greek">ἤδη</foreign>, I 1. 7) &lsquo;<hi rend="italic">then</hi> (and not till then) they are thought to be due to a wanton, malicious, unprovoked, intention to offend&rsquo;&mdash;<foreign lang="greek">ὕβρις</foreign>, the worst of the three kinds of <foreign lang="greek">ὀλιγωρία</foreign> by which anger is provoked; &sect;&sect; 3, 5. </p>

						<p>A third are &lsquo;those who revile and express contempt for things in which the aggrieved parties are themselves most interested (or, to which they are earnestly devoted, or in which they most desire to distinguish themselves, or in which they most value themselves; the last of the four referring to such things as <foreign lang="greek">ἰδέα</foreign>, personal beauty, the second example); as those who are eager and ambitious of distinction in the pursuit of philosophy are especially indignant at any slight, any slur cast upon their favourite study; or those who value themselves upon their personal appearance, if <hi rend="italic">that</hi> be called in question; and similarly in all other cases&rsquo;. This topic expresses the specially angry feeling that is called forth by any ridicule or contempt directed against a man's profession, his studies, his order, any class or society to which he belongs, and is carried even to the extent of a national feeling: any reflexion, in short, upon what he is particularly interested in and attached to or values himself upon, any association with which he is bound up, and on whose credit his own credit and importance in some measure depend. &ldquo;<hi rend="italic">Je me suis souvent despit&eacute;, en mon enfance</hi>,&rdquo; says Montaigne (<hi rend="italic">du P&eacute;dantisme</hi>, Livre I Ch. 24), &ldquo;<hi rend="italic">de veoir en comedies italiennes tousiours un Pedante pour badin, et le surnom de Magister n'avoir gu&egrave;res plus honorable signification parmy nous: car leur estant donn&eacute; en gouvernement, que pouvois-je moins faire que d'estre jaloux de leur reputation?</hi>&rdquo; </p>

I think that the translation above given shews that the vulg. is correct, and there is no manuscript authority for any alteration. <foreign lang="greek">σφόδρα</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">ἰσχυρῶς</foreign> (above) are used here in the same sense, &lsquo;in a high degree&rsquo;.

						<p>&lsquo;Again anger is more readily excited against those who are dear to us, than against those who are not; because we think we are naturally entitled to expect from them kind treatment rather than the reverse&rsquo; (<foreign lang="greek">ἢ μὴ εὖ</foreign>). Comp. Polit. IV (VII) 7, 1328 <hi rend="italic">a</hi> 1, <foreign lang="greek">σημεῖον δέ· πρὸς γὰρ τοὺς συνήθεις καὶ φίλους ὁ θυμὸς αἴρεται μᾶλλον ἢ πρὸς τοὺς ἀγνῶτας, ὀλιγωρεῖσθαι νομίσας. διὸ καὶ Ἀρχίλοχος κ.τ.λ.</foreign> Aristotle adduces this as a proof that (in the Platonic psychological division) the seat of <foreign lang="greek">φιλία</foreign>, love, is the <foreign lang="greek">θυμός</foreign> or <foreign lang="greek">τὸ θυμοειδές</foreign>, the passionate element of the human composition, in which all the noble, generous impulses, zeal, enthusiasm, righteous indignation, resentment, courage, and with them anger, reside. Aristotle is here criticising Plato's scheme, while he recognises its general validity, who assigns (Tim.) <foreign lang="greek">φιλία</foreign> to the belly, with the other <foreign lang="greek">ἐπιθυμίαι</foreign>.

Analogous to <foreign lang="greek">τὴν ἴσην</foreign> here, we have <foreign lang="greek">ἐπ’  ἴσης, ἐπὶ ἴσῃ, ἐξ ἴσης, ἐκ τῆς ἴσης, τὴν ὁμοίην</foreign> (Herod.

With this word <foreign lang="greek">μοῖρα</foreign> is sometimes expressed; as it is likewise in Hom. Il. I (IX) 318, <foreign lang="greek">ἴση μοῖρα μένοντι καὶ εἰ μάλα τις πολεμίζοι</foreign>. At the same time in &sect; 23, we have <foreign lang="greek">τοῖς χάριν μὴ ἀποδιδοῦσιν</foreign>; and Bos himself in a subsequent article on <foreign lang="greek">χάρις</foreign> (p. 523) refers to this, Herod.

However, <foreign lang="greek">μοῖραν</foreign> is just as natural a supplement as the other, and the more numerous analogies, by shewing that the ellipse of it was more usual than that of <foreign lang="greek">χάριν</foreign>, are in favour of the former explanation. </p>
						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">καὶ τοῖς τἀναντίαπαρ’  ἡττόνων</lemma>] &lsquo;And against those that do things contrary to our interests, if they are our inferiors&rsquo; (from <hi rend="italic">inferiors</hi> opposition was not to be expected, from <hi rend="italic">equals</hi> or <hi rend="italic">superiors</hi> it might be; therefore in the former case it is more provoking); &lsquo;for from all such, opposition seems to imply contempt; either because (in opposing us) they seem to regard us as inferiors&rsquo; (<hi rend="italic">quis enim contra potentiores sponte contendit praeliaturque</hi>, Victorius; with <foreign lang="greek">ὡς ἡττόνων</foreign> repeat <foreign lang="greek">καταφρονεῖν φαίνονται</foreign>); &lsquo;or else as if (these benefits had proceeded) from inferiors&rsquo; (and therefore need not be repaid; either not at all, or not in full). These belong to the class described in the preceding topic, &lsquo;those who do not repay a benefit at all, or inadequately&rsquo;; from which the ellipse in <foreign lang="greek">ὡς παρ’  ἡττόνων</foreign> must therefore be filled up; by this non-repayment or inadequate repayment of the benefits received they shew their contempt. </p>
						<p>Those who fail to repay benefits received, altogether or in part, seem to express contempt for their benefactors as inferiors; for they would not neglect such a manifest duty, or do what they know must give offence, unless they thought that it was not worth while to keep on good terms with them.

This second Antiphon is again referred to, Rhet. II 6. 27, <foreign lang="greek">Ἀντιφῶν ὁ ποιητής</foreign>, and his play Meleager, Ib. 23. 20, where two lines are quoted from it. Besides Antiphon's play, there were several others with the same title, and on the same subject, the Calydonian boar-hunt and its tragic consequences, by poets comic as well as tragic, Sophocles, Euripides, Sosiphanes, (Wagner, <hi rend="italic">Trag. Gr. Fragm.</hi> III 179,) Antiphanes, and Philetaerus, Mein., u. s., I 315, 349. (The Meleager of Antiphanes is doubtful, the names of Antiphon and Antiphanes being often interchanged, Mein.) See also Wagner, <hi rend="italic">Trag. Gr. Fragm.</hi> III 113. </p>
						<p>Victorius notes on this allusion: &lsquo;Plexippus was brother of Althea, Meleager's mother, and with his brother Toxeus was put to death by Meleager, because they expressed indignation at his bestowing the prize, the boarskin, which he had received for the destruction of the Calydonian boar, upon his mistress Atalanta. Perhaps it was this very circumstance that Antiphon indicated: he may have represented Plexippus as expressing his vexation at Meleager's <hi rend="italic">insensibility to his want</hi>, to his great anxiety, namely, to possess the boarskin, which his nephew (Meleager) had, <pb n="29"/> regardless of the claims of consanguinity, bestowed nevertheless on Atalanta&rsquo;. (I have altered the second sentence for the sake of clearness.) </p>
						<p>The story of Meleager and the Caledonian boarhunt, is told by Ovid, Metamorph. VIII. The offence of the Thestiadae, Toxeus and Plexippus, and their death by the hand of their nephew, are described in 428&mdash;444: from which Victorius apparently derived his account. </p>

As a virtue (in the Ethics) it is as described by Grant (Eth. Nic. <hi rend="italic">Plan of book</hi>, IV p. 150, first ed.) &lsquo;the virtue of the regulation (or control) of the temper&rsquo;.

						<p>&lsquo;And again a more violent animosity conceived against one person is appeased by punishment previously exacted from another (who may not have excited it so strongly): and therefore the saying of Philocrates was to the point, when some one asked at a time of popular excitement against him, &lsquo;why do not you defend yourself?&rsquo; &lsquo;No, not yet&rsquo;, he replied. &lsquo;Well, but when?&rsquo; &lsquo;As soon as I have seen some one else under accusation&rsquo;, (or &lsquo;under a similar suspicion&rsquo;: <foreign lang="greek">διαβάλλειν</foreign>, &lsquo;to set two people at variance&rsquo;, being specially applied to &lsquo;calumny&rsquo;). &lsquo;For men recover their calmness and evenness of temper, as soon as they have expended their anger upon another object&rsquo;.

He also cites from Plutarch's Life of Alexander the case of Alexander the Great, who expended his anger against the Greeks on the destruction of Thebes, and afterwards spared Athens. Victorius supplies a very pertinent passage from Lysias, Or. XIX <foreign lang="greek">ὑπὲρ τῶν Ἀριστοφάνους χρημάτων  5, 6, ἀκούω γὰρ ἔγωγε...ὅτι πάντων δεινότατόν ἐστι διαβολή· μάλιστα δὲ τοῦτο ἔχοι ἄν τις δεινότατον, ὅταν πολλοὶ ἐπὶ τῇ αὐτῇ αἰτίᾳ εἰς ἀγῶνα καταστῶσιν· ὡς γὰρ ἐπὶ τὸ πολὺ οἱ τελευταῖοι κρινόμενοι σώζονται· πεπαυμένοι γὰρ ὀργῆς αὐτῶν ἀκροᾶσθε, καὶ τοὺς ἐλέγχους ἤδη ἐθέλοντες ἀποδέχεσθε</foreign>. </p>

[See also Arnold Schaefer's <hi rend="italic">Demosthenes und seine Zeit</hi>, II 345 and elsewhere. S.] </p>
						<p>&lsquo;As happened in the case of Ergophilus; for though they (the Athenian assembly) were more indignant with him than with Callisthenes, they let him off, because they had condemned Callisthenes to death the day before&rsquo;. Callisthenes and Ergophilus were both of them Athenian generals commanding in the Chersonese, B. C. 362. See Grote, <hi rend="italic">Hist. of</hi> <pb n="39"/> <hi rend="italic">Gr.</hi> X 508, 511, and the references in Baiter and Sauppe, u. s. pp. 45 and 73 [also A.

Leg. &sect; 180, <foreign lang="greek">καὶ ὅσοι διὰ ταῦτ̓</foreign> (corruption and treachery in the exercise of military command) <foreign lang="greek">ἀπολώλασι παρ’  ὑμῖν, οἱ δὲ χρήματα πάμπολλ̓ ὠφλήκασιν οὐ χαλεπὸν δεῖξαι, Ἐργόφιλος, Κηφισόδοτος, Τιμόμαχος, κ.τ.λ.</foreign> To reconcile this passage with that of Aristotle, we must suppose that Ergophilus was one of those that were fined, but acquitted on the capital charge; which is not quite accurately expressed by <foreign lang="greek">ἀφεῖσαν</foreign>: or possibly the two cases may be distinct. </p>

						<p>&lsquo;Sympathy or compassion calms angry feeling; and if the offence (which has aroused their indignation) has been visited by a heavier punishment than those who are thus angry would themselves have inflicted (their anger is appeased); for they think they have received a sort of (<foreign lang="greek">ὥσπερ</foreign>) satisfaction (for the injury)&rsquo;, or &lsquo;exacted as it were a penalty (for the offence)&rsquo;. </p>

						<p>&lsquo;Or again, if they think that they are themselves in fault, and are suffering no more than they deserve; for justice, &lsquo;reciprocity&rsquo;, or fair retaliation, excites no anger: and so they no longer think that the treatment they receive is in violation of their natural rights, and this, as we said, is essential to (or the notion of) anger&rsquo;. <foreign lang="greek">ἦν</foreign> &lsquo;was&mdash;when we said it&rsquo;: that is, in the definition II 2. 1. On <foreign lang="greek">προσῆκον</foreign>, the appeal to <hi rend="italic">nature</hi> as the basis of <hi rend="italic">obligation</hi>, see note on <foreign lang="greek">μὴ προσήκοντος</foreign> (on II 2. 1 at the end). &lsquo;And therefore punishment should always be preceded by <hi rend="italic">the</hi> (appropriate, <foreign lang="greek">τῷ</foreign>) explanation (of the nature of the offence and the justice of the punishment); for even slaves are less vexed at being punished (when treated in this way)&rsquo;. This is Muretus' interpretation, against Victorius. It is no doubt the natural and correct explanation. [&lsquo;Decet verbis castigare, antequam puniamus.&rsquo; Spengel.] </p>

						<p>&lsquo;(And men in anger are more easily pacified) if they think that (those that they desire to punish) will never find out that the punishment is due to them (that they are the authors of it) and that it is in compensation for their own injuries&rsquo;; (this is the <foreign lang="greek">φαινομένη ὀλιγωρία</foreign> of the defi<pb n="40"/> nition: see note on p. 10,) &lsquo;for anger is always directed against individuals, (II 2. 2, <hi rend="italic">infra</hi> 4. 31, where this is made the characteristic of <hi rend="italic">anger</hi>, as opposed to <hi rend="italic">hatred</hi>,) as appears from the definition&rsquo;. This <hi rend="italic">inference from the definition</hi> is drawn from the <foreign lang="greek">φαινομένη τιμωρία</foreign> which is the object of the angry man. If the punishment is to be such as <hi rend="italic">can be actually seen</hi>, the anger cannot be directed against abstractions like classes or kinds, but must have a single, palpable, concrete, and also animated object; something that can <hi rend="italic">feel</hi>, and <hi rend="italic">shew</hi> that it is hurt. </p>
						<p>&lsquo;And therefore (the trait of character, the representation, in) the verse&rsquo; (of Homer, Odys. IX 504) &lsquo;is right and true (to nature, rightly conceived and expressed), &ldquo;Tell him that it is <hi rend="italic">Ulysses</hi> waster of cities (that blinded him)&rdquo;&mdash;as though his revenge was not complete&rsquo; (i. e. the revenge of Ulysses, or of the character in Homer; which is the suppressed nomin. to <foreign lang="greek">πεποίηται</foreign>, and with which <foreign lang="greek">τετιμωρημένος</foreign> agrees: <hi rend="italic">lit.</hi> the character is rightly represented in the verses as not fully avenged) &lsquo;unless the other (the Cyclops) was aware by whom and for what&rsquo; (the blindness was inflicted). </p>
						<p>The passage runs thus: <foreign lang="greek">Κύκλωψ, αἴ κέν τίς σε καταθνητῶν ἀνθρώπων ὀφθαλμοῦ εἴρηται ἀεικελίην ἀλαωτύν, φάσθαι Ὀδυσσῆα πτολιπόρθιον ἐξαλαῶσαι, υἱὸν Λαέρτεω, Ἰθάκῃ ἔνι οἰκί̓ ἔχοντα</foreign>. &lsquo;So that men are not angry with <hi rend="italic">all the rest</hi> (all besides those who are actually within reach), who are out of sight (far away, for instance), nor any more with the dead&rsquo; (<foreign lang="greek">ἔτι</foreign>, they do not <hi rend="italic">retain</hi> their anger beyond the grave) &lsquo;as with those who have endured the last extremity, and are no longer susceptible of pain, nor indeed of any feeling, which (to give the other pain and to make him <hi rend="italic">feel</hi>) is what the angry man aims at. And therefore the poet (Homer, Iliad, <foreign lang="greek">Ω</foreign> 54) has well said of Hector, wishing to represent Achilles as ceasing from his anger against the dead (<hi rend="italic">lit.</hi> wishing to put a stop to his anger, i. e. <hi rend="italic">represent it as ceasing</hi>): &ldquo;For in truth it is but dumb (senseless) earth that he is outraging in his wrath.&rdquo;&rsquo; Or rather, <foreign lang="greek">παῦσαι βουλόμενος</foreign> means to suggest or assign a reason or motive for Achilles' ceasing from his anger: the words being those of Apollo, who is haranguing the <pb n="41"/> Gods on the propriety of permitting Hector's body to be buried, and concludes his speech very emphatically with this line. </p>
						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">παῦσαι βουλόμενος</lemma>] These words, applied to the poet himself instead of the character Apollo, <hi rend="italic">represented</hi> in the poem, are an instance of a not unfrequent confusion in expressions of this kind. It is the substitution of the author himself for his personage or character; or the conversion of the doctrine of a given philosopher or school into the philosopher or school that holds it. Plat. Rep. II 363 D, <foreign lang="greek">τοὺς δὲ ἀνοσίους...κατορύττουσιν ἐν Ἅιδου, καὶ κοσκίνῳ ὕδωρ ἀναγκάζουσι φέρειν</foreign>, of Musaeus and the Orphics, who &lsquo;<hi rend="italic">represent them as buried</hi>, and compelled to carry...&rsquo; Theaet. 183 A, <foreign lang="greek">ἵνα μὴ στήσωμεν αὐτοὺς τῷ λόγῳ</foreign>, the Heracliteans to wit, &lsquo;that we may not represent them as <hi rend="italic">stopping</hi>&rsquo;&mdash;contrary to their doctrine of the universal flux. Similarly the Eleatics, Ib. 157 A, are called <foreign lang="greek">οἵ ἵσταντες</foreign>, &lsquo;the stationers&rsquo;, meaning those who represent every thing as stationary or at rest. So Soph. 252 A, the opposition <hi rend="italic">school</hi>, of Heraclitus, receives the name of <foreign lang="greek">οἱ ῥέοντες</foreign>, &lsquo;the fluent philosophers&rsquo;, &lsquo;the flowing gentry&rsquo;, instead of their theory: and compare Theaet. 181 A, <foreign lang="greek">τῶν τὰ ἀκίνητα κινούντων</foreign>. A good example is Thuc. I 5, <foreign lang="greek">οἱ παλαιοὶ τῶν ποιητῶν τὰς πύστεις τῶν καταπλεόντων...ἐρωτῶντες εἰ λησταί εἰσιν</foreign>, making their characters put these questions. Arist. Ran. 15, if the vulg. be retained (Meineke omits it), Ib. 833, <foreign lang="greek">ἐτερατεύετο</foreign>, 911 (Aeschylus), <foreign lang="greek">πρώτιστα μὲν γὰρ ἕνα τιν’  ἂν καθῖσεν</foreign> (introduced in a sitting position) <foreign lang="greek">ἐγκαλύψας</foreign>.

						<p>&lsquo;It is plain therefore that those who want to soothe a man down (bring him down to a placid state from the <hi rend="italic">exaltation</hi> of his passion) must derive their propositions (or the traits of character) from these topics, presenting <hi rend="italic">themselves</hi> in such a light&mdash;assuming such a character <hi rend="italic">themselves</hi>&mdash;(as is represented in the foregoing analysis), and the objects of their anger as either formidable, or worthy of high respect, or benefactors, or involuntary agents, or as excessively afflicted at what they have done&rsquo;. <foreign lang="greek">αἰσχύνη</foreign> here is the feeling of reverence or awe which is felt in the presence of any one who is entitled to unusual respect or admiration (see note on c. 2. 22); and <foreign lang="greek">αἰσχύνης ἀξίους</foreign> is equivalent to <foreign lang="greek">τοιούτους πρὸς οὓς αἰσχύνεσθαι δεῖ</foreign>: and <foreign lang="greek">ὑπεραλγοῦντας</foreign> is the representative of the <foreign lang="greek">μεταμελόμενοι</foreign> of &sect; 5. <pb n="42"/> </p>
						<p>I have already hinted a doubt in the notes on the preceding chapter whether <foreign lang="greek">πραότης</foreign> is properly ranked amongst the <foreign lang="greek">πάθη</foreign>. I think that it can be made plainly to appear that it is not. It is introduced no doubt for the purpose of giving the opposite side to the topics of anger, because the student of Rhetoric is in every case required to be acquainted with both sides of a question. And this purpose it may answer very well without being a real opposite of <foreign lang="greek">ὀργή</foreign> or indeed a <foreign lang="greek">πάθος</foreign> at all. If we compare <foreign lang="greek">πραότης</foreign> with the other <foreign lang="greek">πάθη</foreign> analysed in this second book, we find that it differs from all of them in this respect&mdash;that the rest are emotions, instinctive and <hi rend="italic">active</hi>, and tend to some positive result; whereas <foreign lang="greek">πραότης</foreign> is inactive and leads to nothing but the allaying, subduing, lowering, of the angry passion, which it reduces to a particular state, the right or mean state of temper. It seems plain therefore that it is in reality, what it is stated to be in the Ethics, a <foreign lang="greek">ἕξις</foreign>, not a <foreign lang="greek">πάθος</foreign>, of the <hi rend="italic">temper;</hi> an acquired and settled state of one of the <foreign lang="greek">πάθη</foreign>, viz. <foreign lang="greek">ὀργή</foreign>, in the mean state (or due measure) of which (the <foreign lang="greek">πάθη</foreign>) all virtue resides. It is accordingly represented in the Ethics as a virtue, the mean between irascibility and insensibility, the due measure of the passionate element or emotion of our nature; and as a virtue it is the control or regulation of our temper. The true <foreign lang="greek">πάθος</foreign> is the <foreign lang="greek">ὀργή</foreign>, the instinctive capacity of angry feeling, which may be cultivated by habit and education and developed in either direction, for good or evil; till it becomes <foreign lang="greek">ὀργιλότης</foreign> irascibility, or <foreign lang="greek">ἀοργησία</foreign> insensibility&mdash;if it take a <hi rend="italic">wrong</hi> direction&mdash;or else settles into the mean state of a calm and placid temper. And this is the view that is taken of it in Nic. Eth. IV 11, init. <foreign lang="greek">πραότης</foreign> is <foreign lang="greek">μεσότης περὶ ὀργάς</foreign>; Ib. 1125 <hi rend="italic">b</hi> 30, <foreign lang="greek">τὸ μὲν γὰρ πάθος ἐστὶν ὀργή</foreign>; line 34, <foreign lang="greek">βούλεται γὰρ ὁ πρᾶος ἀτάραχος εἶναι καὶ μὴ ἄγεσθαι ὑπὸ τοῦ πάθους, ἀλλ’  ὡς ἂν ὁ λόγος τάξῃ οὕτω καὶ ἐπὶ τούτοις καὶ ἐπὶ τοσοῦτον χρόνον χαλεπαίνειν</foreign>. This is doubtless the correct view; and the other, though no doubt <hi rend="italic">subsequent</hi> to that of the Ethics, is adopted in the Rhetoric merely for convenience, philosophical accuracy not being required.

						<p>&lsquo;Let love then be assumed to be, the wishing to another whatever we think good, for <hi rend="italic">his</hi> sake, not for our own, and the inclination to do such things (to do him good) to the utmost of our power&rsquo;. Eth. Nic. VIII 3, sub init. <foreign lang="greek">οἱ δὲ φιλοῦντες ἀλλήλους βούλονται τἀγαθὰ ἀλλήλοις ταύτῃ ᾗ φιλοῦσιν</foreign>. This makes the nearest approach to a regular definition of <foreign lang="greek">φιλία</foreign> in the Ethics, and is constantly recognised as the principle of love through<pb n="43"/> out the treatise on <foreign lang="greek">φιλία</foreign>, in Books VIII and IX. It represents the desire or the inclination of doing good to the object of your affection, which is naturally, or has become by habit, instinctive, and therefore a <foreign lang="greek">πάθος</foreign>. In both definitions <foreign lang="greek">βούλεσθαι</foreign> is prominent and characteristic. Love is a feeling, a sort of appetite, the wish to do good; the power and the means of doing good being alike accidental and non-essential, though it is true (which is here added to the definition) that the inclination is always present, and will be gratified when the means are forthcoming. The words <foreign lang="greek">ἐκείνου ἕνεκα ἀλλὰ μὴ αὑτοῦ</foreign> express the unselfishness, the disinterested character, of the emotion. <foreign lang="greek">ὁ δὲ βουλόμενός τιν’  εὐπραγεῖν ἐλπίδα ἔχων εὐπορίας δἰ ἐκείνου, οὐκ ἔοικ̓ εὔνους ἐκείνῳ εἶναι, ἀλλὰ μᾶλλον ἑαυτῷ, καθάπερ οὐδὲ φίλος, εἰ θεραπεύει αὐτὸν διά τινα χρῆσιν</foreign> (Eth. Nic. IX 5 sub fin.). Cicero, de Nat. Deor. I ult. (quoted by Schrader), has the same remark. He adds, &lsquo;Prata et arva et pecudum greges diliguntur isto modo quod fructus ex iis capiuntur. Hominum caritas et amicitia gratuita est.&rsquo; </p>
						<p>&lsquo;And a friend is one that loves, and is beloved in return. And those that have this disposition, or entertain this feeling to one another&rsquo;. <foreign lang="greek">εὔνοιαν γὰρ ἐν ἀντιπεπονθόσι φιλίαν εἶναι</foreign>. Eth. N. VIII 2, 1155 <hi rend="italic">b</hi> 34. </p>

					<div3 id="b2c4s3" type="section" n="3">
						<p>&lsquo;From this assumption the necessary consequence is that a friend is one who sympathizes with us in our joys and sorrows, rejoicing at the good that befals us, and grieved at that which gives us pain, not with any ulterior motive; but solely on our friend's account. For all feel joy in obtaining the object of their wishes, and pain at the reverse, so that the pleasures and pains that they feel are an indication of the nature of their wish&rsquo;. The pleasure or pain felt on the occasion of a friend's good or bad fortune is the test of the nature of their wishes, and therefore of their friendship or hatred. And also, as every one feels pleasure at <hi rend="italic">his own</hi> success and pain at disappointment, so by the rule <foreign lang="greek">φίλος ἄλλος αὐτός, ἕτερος αὐτός</foreign>, &lsquo;a friend is a second self&rsquo;, (Eth. N. IX 4, 1166 <hi rend="italic">a</hi> 31, 9, sub init. et 1170 <hi rend="italic">b</hi> 6), the test of friendship is this community of pleasure and pain between friend and friend. <hi rend="italic">Idem velle atque idem nolle ea demum firma amicitia est</hi>, says Sallust.

						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ἐπιδέξιος</lemma> is one of those adjectives compounded with <foreign lang="greek">ἐπί</foreign>, in which the preposition expresses either the <hi rend="italic">tendency</hi> or inclination (<hi rend="italic">lit.</hi> direction), or the <hi rend="italic">liability</hi> to anything, which is defined in the second part of the <pb n="49"/> compound. <foreign lang="greek">ἐπιδέξιος</foreign> is a man that has a tendency to the use of his <hi rend="italic">right hand</hi>, the sign of skill and <hi rend="italic">dexterity;</hi> the right and left hand being severally the symbols of dexterity or cleverness and awkwardness; <hi rend="italic">dexter, laevus;</hi> <foreign lang="greek">δεξιός, δεξιότης, σκαιός, ἀριστερός</foreign>; <hi rend="italic">gauche.</hi> </p>
						<p>Another secondary notion, propitious and unpropitious, belonging to these terms, is derived from the observations of augury, according as the omens appear on the right or left hand: but in Latin, at all events, the notion of &lsquo;awkwardness&rsquo; conveyed by <hi rend="italic">laevus</hi>, and the opposite by <hi rend="italic">dexter</hi>, cannot have been suggested by this, because in their practice omens <hi rend="italic">on the left, laeva, sinistra</hi>, were <hi rend="italic">favourable.</hi> </p>
						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ἐπιδέξιος</lemma> is therefore one who has a tendency to <foreign lang="greek">δεξιότης</foreign>, and follows the analogy of <foreign lang="greek">ἐπικίνδυνος, ἐπιθάνατος</foreign> (liable to danger and death), <foreign lang="greek">ἐπαίτιος, ἐπίδικος, ἐπίκαιρος</foreign> or <foreign lang="greek">ἐπικαίριος, ἐπιλήσμων, ἐπιζήμιος, ἐπίμομφος, ἐπίλυπος, ἐπίνοσος, ἐπίκλοπος, ἐπιμελής, ἐπίμαχος, ἐπαναγκής, ἐπιεικής, ἐπίδοξος</foreign> (&lsquo;one who is expected to&rsquo;... <hi rend="italic">liable to</hi> that expectation, Isocr.

So <foreign lang="greek">ὑπεύθυνος</foreign> (subject or liable to a scrutiny), <foreign lang="greek">ὑπόδικος, ὑπόλογος</foreign> (amenable to an account, accountable, responsible), by metaphor from the analogy of <foreign lang="greek">ὑπόσκιος</foreign> &lsquo;under the shade of&rsquo;, <foreign lang="greek">ὕποσμος</foreign>, Arist. de Anima, II 9, 421 <hi rend="italic">b</hi> 12. <foreign lang="greek">ὑπόστεγος, ὑπαίθριος, ὕπομβρος, ὑπόφορος, ὑπόσπονδος</foreign>. </p>
						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">τωθάζειν</lemma> is a variety of <foreign lang="greek">σκώπτειν</foreign>, to gird at, mock, jeer at, some one in particular; both of them (as well as others of the same class) being distinguished from other forms of wit or pleasantry by their personal direction, or <hi rend="italic">personality.</hi> The word occurs in Plato and Aristophanes, Vesp. 1362 and 1368, and once in Herodotus [II 60]. It is plain from the application of it, for instance in the passages of Aristophanes, that its special meaning is what we now call &lsquo;chaffing&rsquo; or &lsquo;poking fun at&rsquo;, the repartees, or witticisms, mostly of a highly personal character, which pass between the combatants in what is also nowadays called &lsquo;a slanging match&rsquo;. This is confirmed by the use of the word in Arist. Pol. IV (VII) 17, 1336 <hi rend="italic">b</hi> 17. The author is there condemning the practice of <foreign lang="greek">αἰσχρολογία</foreign>, &lsquo;indecent language&rsquo;, which should not be tolerated in a model state. An exception however is made in favour of certain seasons of especial licence, as at the Eleusinian mysteries, and the orgies of particular deities to whose worship this <foreign lang="greek">τωθασμός</foreign> &lsquo;licentious raillery&rsquo; was appropriate, and permitted by law, <foreign lang="greek">οἷς καὶ τὸν τωθασμὸν ἀποδίδωσιν ὁ νόμος·</foreign> such were Dionysus during the celebration of the Bacchanalia, Aphrodite, Priapus, Hermaphroditus, Ilythia, and others; see Schneider ad loc.

						<p>With <foreign lang="greek">τὸ μὲν μετὰ λύπης κ.τ.λ.</foreign>, compare Pol. VIII (V) 10, 1312 <hi rend="italic">b</hi> 32, <foreign lang="greek">ἀλλὰ μᾶλλον τὸ μῖσος· ἡ μὲν γὰρ ὀργὴ μετὰ λύπης πάρεστιν, ὥστε οὐ ῥᾴδιον λογίζεσθαι, ἡ δ’  ἔχθρα ἄνευ λύπης</foreign>. </p>
						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ἐλεήσειεν</lemma>] Victorius refers in illustration to Soph. Aj. 121, where Ulysses says of Ajax, <foreign lang="greek">ἐποικτείρω δέ νιν δύστηνον ἔμπης καίπερ ὄντα δυσμενῆ</foreign>. This shews that the feeling by which he was affected towards his rival was not a long-standing grudge or hatred, but a temporary animosity arising out of the contest for Achilles' arms. </p>
						<p>Plutarch in his little treatise, <foreign lang="greek">περὶ φθόνου καὶ μίσους</foreign>, p. 536 D, Wyttenbach, Vol. III p. 165, gives an account of <foreign lang="greek">μῖσος</foreign> from which something may be added to Aristotle's description. In c. 2, it is said that hatred is due to a sense of injury either to oneself, or to society at large, and sense of wrong to oneself: <foreign lang="greek">μῖσος ἐκ φαντασίας τοῦ ὅτι πονηρὸς ἢ κοινῶς ἢ πρὸς αὐτὸν ἐστὶν ὁ μισούμενος· καὶ γὰρ ἀδικεῖσθαι δόξαντες αὐτοὶ πεφύκασι μισεῖν κ.τ.λ.</foreign> In c. 3, the author remarks that hatred may be directed against irrational animals; some people hate cats, or beetles, or toads, or snakes; Germanicus could not abide either the sight or the crowing of a cock, and so on; <hi rend="italic">envy</hi> however arises only between man and man. This is not the case with anger; which is sometimes excited even by inanimate objects&mdash;Bain [quoted on p. 13]. c. 5; Hatred may be praiseworthy, as <pb n="58"/> <foreign lang="greek">μισοπονηρία</foreign>&mdash;as also anger, in the shape of <foreign lang="greek">νέμεσις</foreign>, righteous indignation, or of moral disapprobation&mdash;envy never can. In the last chapter, 538 D, he thus defines it; <foreign lang="greek">ἔστι δὲ μισοῦντος μὲν προαίρεσις κακῶς ποιῆσαι</foreign> (Arist. <foreign lang="greek">ἔφεσις κακοῦ</foreign>)<foreign lang="greek">· καὶ τὴν δύναμιν οὕτως ὁρίζονται, διάθεσίν τινα καὶ προαίρεσιν ἐπιτηρητικὴν τοῦ κακῶς ποιῆσαι</foreign> (on the watch to do him mischief) <foreign lang="greek">τῷ φθόνῳ δὲ τοῦτο γοῦν ἄπεστι</foreign>. The distinction between envy and hatred, in respect of the amount of mischief which they would do to their respective objects, is then described, and the treatise ends. </p>

						<p>This section points out the application of the contents of the preceding chapter to the purposes of Rhetoric. &lsquo;It is plain from all this that it is possible, in respect of enmity and friendship, either, when men are enemies or friends, to prove it; or if not, to represent them as such; or if they assert or maintain it, to refute their assertion; or, if there be a dispute (about a feeling or an offence), whether it be due to anger or enmity, to refer it, trace it, to either of the two which you may prefer&rsquo;. </p>

						<p>&lsquo;Let fear be defined, a pain or disturbance arising from a mental (presentation or) impression (<foreign lang="greek">φαντασία</foreign>, note on I 11. 6) (a vivid presentiment) of coming evil, destructive or painful: for it is not <hi rend="italic">all</hi> evils that men are afraid of, as for instance of the prospect of being wicked or dull (slow, stupid), but only those that amount to great pain or ruin: and this too only if they appear to be not far off, but close at hand, so as to be imminent or threatening. For things very remote are not subjects of alarm: for every one knows that he must die, but by reason of death not being actually impending, people care nothing at all for it&rsquo;. </p>
						<p>It is the <hi rend="italic">proximity</hi> of danger that causes fear. Gaisford quotes a poetical illustration from Pind. Nem. VI 94, <foreign lang="greek">τὸ δὲ πὰρ ποδὶ ναὸς ἑλισσόμενον ἀεὶ κυμάτων λέγεται παντὶ μάλιστα δονεῖν θυμόν</foreign>. </p>

It is in overmastering the sense of danger, in controlling the fears that interfere with the exercise of our duties, and especially the dread of death (the most fearful of all things) in battle, that true courage resides&mdash;<foreign lang="greek">ὅλως μὲν οὖν φοβερὰ λέγεται τὰ ποιητικὰ φόβου. τοιαῦτα δ’  ἐστὶν ὅσα φαίνεται ποιητικὰ λύπης φθαρτικῆς·</foreign> it is not the anticipation of pain of all kinds, as the pain of envy, of rivalry, of shame, that is entitled to the name of &lsquo;fear&rsquo;, <foreign lang="greek">ἀλλ’  ἐπὶ μόναις ταῖς τοιαύταις φαινομέναις ἔσεσθαι λύπαις φόβος γίνεται, ὅσων ἡ φύσις ἀναιρετικὴ τοῦ ζῆν......ὁ γὰρ κίνδυνος ἐπὶ τοῖς τοιούτοις λέγεται μόνοις τῶν φοβερῶν, ὅταν πλήσιον ᾖ τὸ τῆς τοιαύτης φθορᾶς ποιητικόν. φαίνεται δὲ κίνδυνος ὅταν πλήσιον φαίνηται</foreign>.

						<p>&lsquo;From this explanation of the nature of fear and things fearful, and of the several dispositions that incline us to fear individually, we may plainly gather what confidence is, and the sort of things that inspire confidence, and the dispositions or habits of mind that incline us to confidence: because confidence is the opposite of fear, and that which inspires the one, the object of the one, is opposite to that which inspires, the object of, the other: and therefore, the hope (which <foreign lang="greek">θάρσος</foreign> implies, <hi rend="italic">its</hi> hope) of what is conducive to security, is attended by a fancy&rsquo; (or mental representation, or impression, derived from and connected with sense, see on I 11. 6) &lsquo;of their being close at hand, and the expectation&rsquo; (<foreign lang="greek">ἐλπίς</foreign> in its alternative, general, sense) &lsquo;of things to be dreaded by a fancy of either their non-existence or remoteness&rsquo;.

And if there be means of rectifying, setting right again, repairing, remedying, the mischief we dread (<hi rend="italic">after</hi> it is done), or of helping, defending ourselves against it, rescuing ourselves from it, (<hi rend="italic">before</hi> it is done; comp. &sect; 12, where Schrader thus distinguishes the two, <hi rend="italic">correctio mali praeteriti, auxilium mali imminentis</hi>,) numerous or effective, or both, and we have neither been already injured ourselves nor injured others&rsquo;&mdash;the first on the principle on which the proverb is founded, &ldquo;the burnt child dreads the fire,&rdquo; what we have already suffered we fear to suffer again; and the second, because when we have done no injury we fear no retaliation&mdash; &lsquo;or again if we have either no rivals and competitors at all, or such as we have are powerless; or, if they have power, are our friends or benefactors or indebted to us for services&rsquo;. All these are topics opposite to those of fear, comp. &sect;&sect; 8, 9, 10, 12; from which it appears that the rivalry of the <foreign lang="greek">ἀνταγωνισταί</foreign> consists in the competition for the same things, where there is not enough of them for both the competitors; the rivalry, which naturally engenders ill-feeling, makes you afraid of some injury from your competitor, a fear which is exchanged for confidence, as far as the other is concerned, when there is no rivalry between you. &lsquo;Or if those who have the same interests are more numerous or more powerful, or both, (than those whose interests are different, our rivals or competitors)&rsquo;. </p>

						<p>This is an answer to the question <foreign lang="greek">πῶς διακείμενοι θαρραλέοι εἰσίν</foreign> &sect; 16. &lsquo;The feelings and dispositions in ourselves indicative of confidence, are, the opinion which we entertain of great success in our previous undertakings, and of having hitherto been exempt from injury, or if we have often run into danger and escaped&rsquo;: all of these are apt to make men sanguine as regards the future. Comp. Virg. Aen. I 198, <hi rend="italic">O socii, neque enim ignari sumus ante malorum, O passi graviora, dabit deus his quoque finem. Vos et Scyllaeam rabiem...revocate animos maestumque timorem mittite, forsan et haec olim meminisse iuvabit...illic fas regna resurgere Troiae. Durate et vosmet rebus servate secundis.</hi> Hor. Od.

What is said here of the inexperience of men at sea tending to confidence seems to be contradicted by the observation in Eth. Nic. III 9, 1115 <hi rend="italic">b</hi> 1, <foreign lang="greek">οὐχ οὕτω δὲ ὡς οἱ θαλάττιοι· οἱ μὲν γὰρ ἀπεγνώκασι τὴν σωτηπίαν καὶ τὸν θάνατον τὸν τοιοῦτον δυσχεραίνουσιν, οἱ δ’  εὐέλπιδές εἰσι παρὰ τὴν ἐμπειρίαν</foreign>. Victorius thus reconciles the apparently conflicting statements: in the passage of the Ethics the brave men, who have had no experience, <hi rend="italic">do</hi> keep up their courage though they despair of safety, and are indignant at such a death as that of drowning; the death which they covet being death on the field of battle: the sailors on the contrary are sanguine by reason of the resources which their experience has taught them. Still the contradiction is not removed by this explanation; for in the Rhetoric the inexperienced are confident, in the Ethics they are in despair, though their courage may not fail. In fact the two cases are not identical, nor intended to be so. In the Ethics the virtue of courage is displayed in the extremest danger, in the other there is no virtue at all; the ignorance of the. danger inspires confidence&mdash;not courage&mdash;and that is all. The passage of the Rhetoric is explained by another in Magn. Mor. I 21, quoted by Schrader, <foreign lang="greek">ἔστι γὰρ καὶ κατ’  ἐμπειρίαν τις ἀνδρεῖος, οἷον οἱ στρατιῶται· οὗτοι γὰρ οἴδασι δἰ ἐμπειπίαν, ὅτι ἐν τοιούτῳ τόπῳ ἢ ἐν τοιούτῳ καιρῷ ἢ οὕτως ἔχοντι ἀδύνατόν τι παθεῖν...πάλιν οὖν εἰσιν ἀνδρεῖοι ἐκ τοῦ ἐναντίου τῆς ἐμπειρίας· οἱ γὰρ ἄπειροι τῶν ἀποβησομένων οὐ φοβοῦνται διὰ τὴν ἀπειρίαν</foreign>. </p>

						<p>&lsquo;For the angry feeling is accompanied with confidence, and to abstain from wrong oneself and yet to be wronged by others is provocative of anger, and the divine power is supposed to aid (side with) the injured&rsquo;. The argument is this, Innocence of wrong is a ground of confidence: but this may be extended to the general (<foreign lang="greek">ὅλως</foreign>) case of the divine favour, and the feeling of confidence is heightened if we believe that we have heaven on our side, which we argue from favourable omens and oracles. This divine authority strengthens our conviction of our innocence, of our having right on our side (so Victorius), and therefore our confidence. Another reason for this increase of confidence is the <hi rend="italic">angry feeling</hi> which is excited in us by the sense of unjust treatment from others to whom we have done no wrong, for anger always implies confidence; and at the same time we feel ourselves under the protection of heaven, which is always supposed to take the part of the innocent and injured. <foreign lang="greek">θαῤῥαλέον ἡ ὀργή</foreign>.

					<p>Prof. Bain's remarks on shame&mdash;<hi rend="italic">Emotions and Will</hi>, p. 142&mdash;are so brief that they may here be quoted entire. It falls under the general head of Emotions of Self, and in the subordinate division under that of self-love. &ldquo;The feeling of shame is resolved by a reference to the dread of being condemned, or ill-thought of, by others. Declared censure and public infliction, by inviting the concurrent hostile regards of a wide circle of spectators, constitute an open shame. One is also put to shame by falling into any act that people are accustomed to disapprove, and will certainly censure in their own minds, although they may refrain from actually pronouncing condemnation. This is the most frequent case in common society. Knowing the hard judgments passed upon all breaches of conventional decorum, it is a source of mortification to any one to be caught in a slip; they can too easily imagine the sentence that they do not actually hear. The character of the pain of all such situations exactly accords with the pains of expressed disapprobation.&rdquo; [Chap. XI &sect; 16, ed. 1875.] </p>

This latter conception of <foreign lang="greek">αἰσχύνη</foreign> corresponds to Aristotle's definition here, and in Eth. N. IV 15 init. <foreign lang="greek">φόβος τις ἀδοξίας</foreign>. On <foreign lang="greek">αἰδώς</foreign>, as a principle of action, and <foreign lang="greek">νέμεσις</foreign>, the two primary notions of duty, duty to oneself, and duty to others or justice, see an interesting note of Sir A. Grant, on Eth. N. II 7. 14. In Soph. Aj. 1073&mdash;1086, the two fundamental principles, by which human conduct should be regulated, the foundations of law, justice, and military discipline, are <foreign lang="greek">αἰδώς</foreign> or <foreign lang="greek">αἰσχύνη</foreign>, and <foreign lang="greek">δεός</foreign> or <foreign lang="greek">φόβος. δεὸς γὰρ ᾧ πρόσεστιν αἰσχύνη θ’  ὁμοῦ σωτηρίαν ἔχοντα τόνδ̓ ἐπίστασο</foreign>.

						<p>Aristotle both here and in the Ethics represents <foreign lang="greek">αἰδώς</foreign> or <foreign lang="greek">αἰσχύνη</foreign>, and consequently the opposite, as <foreign lang="greek">πάθη</foreign>, instinctive emotions; and Bain by classing shame amongst the emotions takes the same view. Eth. N. IV 15, init. <foreign lang="greek">περὶ δὲ αἰδοῦς ὥς τινος ἀρετῆς οὐ προσήκει λέγειν· πάθει γὰρ μᾶλλον ἔοικεν ἢ ἕξει. ὁρίζεται γοῦν φόβος</foreign> (which is a <foreign lang="greek">πάθος</foreign>) <foreign lang="greek">τῆς ἀδοξίας, ἀποτελεῖται δὲ τῷ περὶ τὰ δεινὰ φόβῳ παραπλήσιον· ἐρυθραίνονται γὰρ οἱ αἰσχυνόμενοι, οἱ δὲ τὸν θάνατον φοβούμενοι ὠχριῶσιν. σωματικὰ δὴ φαίνεταί πως εἶναι ἀμφότερα, ὅπερ δοκεῖ πάθους μᾶλλον ἢ ἕξεως εἶναι</foreign>. This view of &lsquo;shame&rsquo; or &lsquo;modesty&rsquo; as a <foreign lang="greek">πάθος</foreign> and not a <foreign lang="greek">ἕξις</foreign>, an emotion and not a moral state or virtue, is commented on and criticized by Alexander Aphrodisiensis in his <foreign lang="greek">ἀπορίαι καὶ λύσεις</foreign>, Bk. <foreign lang="greek">Δ</foreign> c. <foreign lang="greek">κά</foreign> (21), <foreign lang="greek">περὶ αἰδοῦς</foreign>. The chapter opens with a reference to the two passages of the Nic. Ethics in which the subject is treated, and after an examination and criticism of the definition, he proceeds thus; <foreign lang="greek">ἡ γὰρ αἰδὼς οὐκ ἔοικεν ἁπλῶς εἶναι φόβος ἀδοξίας, ἀλλὰ πολὺ πρότερον ἀλλοτριότης πρὸς τὰ αἰσχρά, δἰ ἣν οἱ οὕτως ἔχοντες φοβοῦνται τὴν ἐπ’  αὐτοῖς ἀδοξίαν. εἰ δέ ἐστι τοιοῦτον ἡ αἰδώς, οὐκ ἔτ̓ ἂν οὐδὲ πάθος ἁπλῶς εἴη, ἀλλ̓ ἕξις τις καὶ διάθεσις, ᾗ τὸ προειρημένον ἕπεται πάθος</foreign>. </p>
						<p>The character of the <foreign lang="greek">ἀναίσχυντος</foreign>, as depicted by Theophrastus, Charact. c. <foreign lang="greek">θ́. περὶ ἀναισχυντίας</foreign>, has not much in common with the analysis of Aristotle. One common feature appears in &sect; 6 of this chapter, <foreign lang="greek">τὸ κερδαίνειν ἀπὸ μικρῶν ἢ ἀπ’  αἰσχρῶν</foreign>; Theophrastus' definition of <foreign lang="greek">ἀναισχυντία</foreign> being <foreign lang="greek">καταφρόνησις δόξης αἰσχροῦ ἕνεκα κέρδους</foreign>. But the completest portrait of the <foreign lang="greek">ἀναίσχυντος</foreign> that Greek antiquity has bequeathed to us, is doubtless the <foreign lang="greek">ἀλλαντοπώλης</foreign> of Aristophanes' Knights. In this character the ideal of &lsquo;shameless impudence&rsquo; seems to be reached, and human nature can go no further. </p>

This I allow to be just as good, perhaps better, in point of sense, certainly more amusing, than my own interpretation: but as far as I am able to judge, the latter is more naturally suggested by the Greek, and more in accordance with precedent, as collected from the language of the previous topics of these chapters on the <foreign lang="greek">πάθη</foreign>.

						<p>In the first clause of this section, as Schrader has noticed, there is a momentary transition from the <hi rend="italic">persons</hi> who feel shame to the <hi rend="italic">things</hi> which produce it; in the second, a return is made to the masculine.

						<p>The answer of Euripides to the Syracusans is given&mdash;<hi rend="italic">invented</hi> say some&mdash;by the Scholiast, in these words: <foreign lang="greek">Εὐριπίδης πρὸς τοὺς Συρακοσίους πρέσβυς ἀποσταλεὶς καὶ περὶ εἰρήνης καὶ φιλίας δεόμενος, ὡς ἐκεῖνοι ἀνένευον, εἶπεν· ἔδει, ἄνδρες Συρακόσιοι, εἰ καὶ διὰ μηδὲν ἄλλο, ἀλλά γε διὰ τὸ ἄρτι ὑμῶν δέεσθαι, αἰσχύνεσθαι ἡμᾶς ὡς θαυμάζοντας</foreign>. We know nothing from any other source of Euripides having ever been employed on any other occasion in any public capacity; but as Aeschylus fought at Marathon, and Sophocles was one of the ten generals who conducted the exhibition against Samos under Pericles, there seems to be no <hi rend="italic">a priori</hi> objection to the employment of another tragic poet in a similar public service. That Euripides could speak in public we learn from a reference of Aristotle to another answer of his, Rhet. III 15. 8. Nevertheless the objection has been held fatal to the soundness of the reading, and Ruhnken, <hi rend="italic">Hist. Crit.</hi> (ap. Buhle), has proposed to substitute <foreign lang="greek">Ὑπερίδου</foreign> for <foreign lang="greek">Εὐριπίδου</foreign> in our text, the one name being constantly confounded by transcribers with the other. Sauppe <hi rend="italic">Orat. Att.</hi> Vol. III. p. 216, <hi rend="italic">Fragm. Oratt.</hi> XV argues the question, and decides (rightly, I think) in favour of the vulgate. There is in fact no reason whatsoever, except our ignorance, for denying that Euripides could have been sent ambassador to Syracuse. Sauppe thinks that the occasion probably was the negociations carried on between Athens and Sicily from 427&mdash;415, previous to the Sicilian expedition. His note ends with an inquiry whether another Euripides, Xenophon's father, Thuc. II 70, 79, may possibly be meant here. The extreme appositeness of the answer to Aristotle's topic, which seems to have suggested the suspicion of manufacture for the special occasion, tells in reality at least as much in favour of its genuineness; it is because it <hi rend="italic">is</hi> so appropriate, that Aristotle remembers and quotes it. </p>

						<p>This section is the commencement of the third division of the analysis of shame and its opposite; the <hi rend="italic">subjective</hi> view of them, shewing how they appear in the persons themselves who are affected by them. </p>
						<p>&lsquo;The likely subjects of shame themselves are, first of all men of such a disposition, or in such a state of mind, as if they had certain others standing to them in the same relation as those of whom we said they stand in awe&rsquo;. Such are persons whom they respect and admire, whom they regard as <hi rend="italic">authorities</hi>, whose judgment and opinions they look up to. A somewhat complicated assemblage of words to express this simple meaning, that the disposition to shame is the same state of mind as that which has been before described as felt in the presence of certain classes of persons of whom we stand in awe; which are immediately specified. &lsquo;These were (i. e. <hi rend="italic">are</hi>, as we described them, <foreign lang="greek">ὧν τις τῆς δόξης φροντίζει, τῶν θαυμάζοντων, καὶ οὓς θαυμάζει κ.τ.λ.</foreign> <hi rend="italic">ante</hi> &sect;&sect; 14, 15) either those that we admire, or that admire us, or by whom we wish to be admired, or those from whom we require any aid or service which we shall not obtain if we <pb n="85"/> lose our credit with them; and these either as actually looking on, actual spectators (of what we say or do), of which Cydias&rsquo; harangue on the allotment of Samos furnishes an example&mdash;for he required them to imagine the entire Greek people to be standing round the Athenians in a circle, as actual spectators, and not mere (future or expectant) listeners, of the decree they are about to make&mdash;or if such be near at hand, or likely to be listeners&rsquo; (to what we have to say: this especially for the <hi rend="italic">deliberative speaker</hi>). </p>
						<p>The <foreign lang="greek">Σάμου κληρουχία</foreign> here referred to is not the allotment of the Samian lands amongst Athenian citizens after the revolt of the island and its subsequent reduction by Pericles in 440 B.C. Thucydides, who gives an account of the treatment of the Samians after their defeat, I 117, makes no mention of any such allotment. It is referred by Ruhnken, <hi rend="italic">Hist. Crit.</hi>, and by Grote, <hi rend="italic">Hist. of Gr.</hi> X 407 and note, 408, to Timotheus' conquest of Samos in 366, and the subsequent Athenian settlement there in 352; of the former of which Cornelius Nepos speaks, Vit. Timoth. c. 1, ap. Clinton <hi rend="italic">F. H.</hi> sub anno 440. It was against this allotment of Samos that Cydias (of whom nothing seems to be known beyond this notice, his name does not even occur in Baiter and Sauppe's list of Orators,) made his appeal to the Athenian assembly, and invited them to decide the question of spoliation, as though all Greece were standing round them looking on. Isocrates, Paneg. &sect; 107, is obliged to defend his countrymen from the reproach (<foreign lang="greek">ὀνειδίζειν</foreign>) of this and similar practices, not specially named, by the plea that the appropriation of the territory was not due to rapacity, but solely to the desire of securing the safety of the desolated properties by planting a colony to defend them. </p>
						<p>&lsquo;And therefore also men in misfortune don't like (are ashamed) to be seen by their <hi rend="italic">quondam</hi> rivals or emulators, because these are admirers&rsquo;; and therefore, by the rule previously laid down, they are ashamed to appear before them in this undignified and melancholy condition. </p>

					<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">χάρις</lemma>, the <foreign lang="greek">πάθος</foreign>, or instinctive emotion, of which this Chapter treats, represents the tendency or inclination to benevolence, to do a grace, favour, or service, spontaneous and disinterested (&sect;&sect; 2, 5) to another, or to our fellow-man.

					<div3 id="b2c7s2" type="section" n="2">
						<p>&lsquo;Let us then assume benevolence to be that, in accordance with (under the influence of) which he who has the feeling is said to do a service to one who is in want of it, not in return for anything (as a compensation or payment)&rsquo;&mdash;it must be spontaneous as an instinct&mdash;&lsquo;nor for his own benefit, but for the advantage of the <hi rend="italic">other</hi> party (to the transaction, <foreign lang="greek">ἐκείνῳ</foreign>): the favour is great if it be (conferred on) one who is in extreme need of it, or if (the benefit it confers) be of great value or difficult (of attainment), on occasions of the like kind (<foreign lang="greek">μεγάλοις καὶ χαλεποῖς</foreign>), or if it be unique&rsquo; (a solitary instance of such a service, the only time it ever was conferred: supply <foreign lang="greek">ἢ ἂν μόνος ὁ ὑπουργῶν ὑπουργήσῃ</foreign> or simply <foreign lang="greek">χαρίσηται</foreign>), &lsquo;or the first of its kind or the most important of its kind (<hi rend="italic">lit.</hi> more than any one else has ever done)&rsquo;. </p>
						<p>A passage of Cicero, de Invent. XXXVIII. 112, will serve as a commentary on this. <hi rend="italic">Beneficia ex sua vi, ex tempore, ex animo eius qui facit, ex casu, considerantur.</hi> (The character of acts of benevolence is gathered or determined from these four considerations.) <hi rend="italic">Ex sua vi quaerentur hoc modo: magna an parua, facilia an difficilia, singularia sint an vulgaria, vera an falsa, quanam exornatione honestentur: ex tempore autem, si tum quum indigeremus, quum ceteri non possent, aut nollent, opitulari, si tum quum spes deseruisset: ex animo, si non sui commodi causa, si eo consilio fecit omnia ut hoc conficere posset: ex casu, si non fortuna sed industria factum videbitur aut si industria fortuna obstitisse.</hi> From this close resemblance I should infer, not that Cicero had Aristotle's work before him when he wrote the <hi rend="italic">de Inventione</hi>, but rather that it had been handed down, perhaps from him in the first instance, as a common-place in the ordinary books of Rhetoric. </p>
						<p>It was a disputed question, says Ar. again, Eth. Nic. VIII 15, 1163 <hi rend="italic">a</hi> 9, seq., whether the magnitude of a favour or benefit is to be measured by the amount of service to the recipient, or by the beneficence<note anchored="yes"><foreign lang="greek">τῇ τοῦ δράσαντος εὐεργεσίᾳ</foreign>. The amount of pains, labour, risk, or sacrifice incurred by the conferrer of the benefit here seems to be regarded as the <hi rend="italic">measure</hi> of his &lsquo;beneficence&rsquo;.</note> of the doer of it: the former being always inclined in the estimate of its value to underrate, the latter to overrate it. <foreign lang="greek">οἱ μὲν γὰρ παθόντες τοιαῦτά φασι λαβεῖν παρὰ τῶν εὐεργετῶν ἃ μικρὰ ἦν ἐκείνοις καὶ ἐξῆν παρ’  ἑτέρων λαβεῖν, κατασμικρίζοντες· οἱ δ̓ ἀνάπαλιν τὰ μέγιστα τῶν παῤ αὑτοῖς καὶ ἃ παῤ ἄλλων οὐκ ἦν, καὶ ἐν κινδύνοις ἢ τοιαύταις χρείαις</foreign>. <pb n="89"/> </p>
						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">μὴ ἀντί τινος</lemma>] This might seem at first sight to exclude <hi rend="italic">gratitude</hi> from the notion of <foreign lang="greek">χάρις</foreign>; but this I believe cannot be intended; though gratitude and ingratitude are not distinctly noticed in the chapter. The case is this. <foreign lang="greek">χάρις</foreign> in this chapter is employed exclusively in its <hi rend="italic">subjective</hi> sense (see the Lexx.), to denote one of the instinctive feelings: when therefore it is applied to express <hi rend="italic">gratitude</hi>, it is the feeling only, and not the actual return of the favour, which is taken into account. This is expressed by the words <foreign lang="greek">μὴ ἀντί τινος</foreign>, which signify that it is &lsquo;independent of the actual requital of the benefit conferred&rsquo;: and, indeed, gratitude may be equally felt when the receiver of the favour has no means of repaying it in kind. This independent or subjective feeling of gratitude is therefore opposed in the words <foreign lang="greek">μὴ ἀντί τινος</foreign> to the notion of a <foreign lang="greek">μισθός</foreign>, the &lsquo;payment&rsquo; or wages which a workman receives in fulfilment of an implied contract; where there is no feeling of gratitude or obligation remaining on either side after the work is done and paid for. Whereas gratitude is a permanent feeling, and the sense of obligation still remains after the requital or repayment of the service. The opposite to this is <foreign lang="greek">ὅτι ἀπέδωκαν ἀλλ’  οὐκ ἔδωκαν</foreign>, &sect; 5. It may be argued in certain cases that what appears to proceed from gratitude or spontaneous benevolence, is in reality nothing but the repayment of an obligation, with which <foreign lang="greek">χάρις</foreign> is not concerned. </p>

						<p>&lsquo;All our natural impulses are <hi rend="italic">wants</hi>, and of these those especially which are accompanied by pain at the non-attainment (<foreign lang="greek">μὴ γιγνομένου</foreign>) of their object: such are the appetites and desires, as love&rsquo;. On <foreign lang="greek">ὄρεξις</foreign> see p. 9, note on II 2. 1. The connexion of this remark is with the <foreign lang="greek">δεομένῳ</foreign> of the preceding definition. The feeling (and the consequent act) of benevolence always implies the satisfaction of some want in the recipient of the favour; if he did not <hi rend="italic">want</hi> it, it would be no favour. And besides this, the magnitude of the want is a measure of the magnitude of the favour and of the benevolence that prompts it. Aristotle therefore proceeds to notice some of the principal wants, in the satisfaction of which <foreign lang="greek">χάρις</foreign> is manifested in the highest degree. <hi rend="italic">All</hi> our natural impulses imply wants&mdash;the <foreign lang="greek">ὀρέξεις</foreign>, the &lsquo;conative&rsquo; or striving faculties, all aim at some object which they desire to attain. To the &lsquo;impulsive&rsquo; element of our nature, <foreign lang="greek">τὸ ὀρεκτικόν</foreign>, belong the appetites and desires such as love (the animal passion). (Besides these the <foreign lang="greek">ὄρεξις</foreign> includes <foreign lang="greek">θυμός</foreign>, and <foreign lang="greek">βούλησις</foreign> &lsquo;the will&rsquo;.) These appetites and desires, being always accompanied with pain when thwarted or failing to attain their object, are for this reason &lsquo;wants in the highest degree&rsquo;, <foreign lang="greek">μάλιστα δεήσεις</foreign>. </p>
						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">καὶ αἱ</lemma> (<foreign lang="greek">ἐπιθυμίαι</foreign>) <foreign lang="greek">ἐν ταῖς τοῦ σώματος κακώσεσι καὶ ἐν κινδύνοις</foreign> (<foreign lang="greek">μάλιστα δεήσεις εἰσίν</foreign>)] &lsquo;Also those (desires) that occur in (belong to) bodily <pb n="90"/> sufferings or injuries (are wants of a high degree): for in fact (this a <hi rend="italic">note</hi> on the preceding) every one that is in danger or in pain feels desire&rsquo;. For <foreign lang="greek">ἐπιθυμεῖ ὁ λυπούμενος</foreign> compare <hi rend="italic">supra</hi> c. 4 &sect; 3, <foreign lang="greek">γιγνομένων ὧν βούλονται χαίρουσι πάντες, τῶν ἐναντίων δὲ λυποῦνται, ὥστε τῆς βουλήσεως σημεῖον αἱ λῦπαι καὶ αἱ ἡδοναί</foreign>. </p>
						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">κάκωσις</lemma>, in its ordinary use, and especially in its legal application, denotes a particular kind of injury or suffering, viz. ill-treatment. It also however bears the more general sense, at least three times in Thucydides, II 43, where <foreign lang="greek">κάκωσις</foreign> is a repetition of <foreign lang="greek">κακοπραγοῦντες</foreign>, and implies ill-fortune, disaster, suffering: VII 4, and 82, <foreign lang="greek">τοῖς τε τραύμασι καὶ τῇ ἄλλῃ κακώσει</foreign>, where the sense is unmistakable, and coincides exactly with the use of it here. </p>
						<p>&lsquo;And therefore it is, that those who stand by (assist or succour, <foreign lang="greek">παριστάμενοι</foreign>) a man in poverty or exile, however slight the service they render, by reason of the magnitude of the want and the occasion, confer a great favour&rsquo; (or, &lsquo;are very agreeable, acceptable&rsquo;. The word seems to include both senses); &lsquo;like the man who lent the mat <foreign lang="greek">ἐν Λυκείῳ</foreign>&rsquo;. <hi rend="italic">A friend in need is a friend indeed.</hi> </p>
						<p>I have not attempted to translate the word <foreign lang="greek">Λυκείῳ</foreign>. We do not even know whether it is the name of a man or a place: it might also be the title of a play or a speech, from which the instance was borrowed. Victorius says, &lsquo;historia ignota mihi est;&rsquo; Schrader, &lsquo;quis, cui, quando dederit, incertum (rather <hi rend="italic">ignotum</hi>) est.&rsquo; The meaning is plain enough: it is a case like that of Sir Philip Sidney's cup of cold water, in which circumstances of time and place enormously enhance the value and importance of something which in ordinary circumstances is trifling and worthless [cf. Vol. I. pp. 84, 144]. </p>

					<div3 id="b2c7s4" type="section" n="4">
						<p>&lsquo;Accordingly, the service that is received&rsquo; (by the recipients, which seems to be the subject of <foreign lang="greek">ἔχειν</foreign>) &lsquo;must be especially directed to these same things&rsquo; (viz. the satisfaction of the more urgent wants and desires. I have followed Bekker in retaining <foreign lang="greek">ταῦτα</foreign>. MS A^{c} has <foreign lang="greek">ταῦτα</foreign>, and Q, Y^{b}, Z^{b} <foreign lang="greek">τοιαῦτα</foreign>, which is adopted by Victorius), &lsquo;or if not, to things equal or greater. And therefore, now that the times, circumstances, and dispositions of mind, which give rise to benevolent feeling, have been pointed out, it is plain that it is from these sources that we must provide our materials (for producing it in our audience), by shewing that the one party (the recipient in the transaction) either is <pb n="91"/> or has been<note anchored="yes"><foreign lang="greek">γεγενημένους</foreign>. There seems to be no intelligible distinction here made between <foreign lang="greek">εἶναι</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">γίγνεσθαι</foreign>; at least, none that is worth expressing in the translation. What again is the difference intended between the two verbs in this passage, <foreign lang="greek">γενόμενα ἢ ἐσόμενα</foreign>, II. 8. 13? It may be supposed that Aristotle has only used the latter verb in default of a perfect of the former. And it is certain that the Greek writers do occasionally employ forms of <foreign lang="greek">γίγνεσθαι</foreign> where our idiom requires the substitution of the simple &lsquo;to be&rsquo;. If the word here be translated literally, the notion of &lsquo;becoming&rsquo; must be rendered by &lsquo;having come to be in, or fallen into, such want&rsquo;.</note> in want or pain such (as has been described), and the other either has done or is doing a service in a case of need, the service and the need being each of the kind mentioned&rsquo;. </p>
					</div3>
					<div3 id="b2c7s5" type="section" n="5">
						<p>&lsquo;It is plain too from what sources (or topics) may be derived the materials for depriving (those who have conferred a favour) of (the credit of) this kindly and benevolent feeling, and making them (and their act appear, representing them as) devoid of all such feeling and intention&rsquo;. This is Victorius' interpretation, and I think more consistent with what follows than that of Schrader, who understands it of the audience, and not of the benefactor; and explains it, &ldquo;facere ut affectu illo, qui ad gratiam habendam referendamve fertur, vacui fiant auditores.&rdquo; <foreign lang="greek">ἀχάριστος</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">ἀχάριτος</foreign>, &lsquo;without grace&rsquo;, stand in the first instance for &lsquo;unpleasing, disagreeable&rsquo;,&mdash;so in Homer, Theognis, Herodotus&mdash; and express the opposite of <foreign lang="greek">κεχαρισμένος</foreign>, <hi rend="italic">supra</hi> &sect; 3: and this, with the substitution of the special sense of <foreign lang="greek">χάρις</foreign> as a <foreign lang="greek">πάθος</foreign> for the general sense of grace, beauty, favour, is the meaning given to the words by Aristotle here: &lsquo;without grace&rsquo; is here to be understood &lsquo;without this kindly feeling&rsquo;. The ordinary use of the word for &lsquo;ungrateful&rsquo; is founded upon a third sense of <foreign lang="greek">χάρις</foreign>, viz. gratitude. </p>
						<p>&lsquo;For (we may argue) either that the (boasted) service is, or was, done from motives of self-interest, and this, as we said, (<foreign lang="greek">ἦν</foreign>, by definition, &sect; 2,) is not benevolent feeling, or that the service was an accident of coincidence, or done under constraint, or that it was a payment and not a free gift, whether the party was aware (of his obligation to the other, so Victorius) or not<note anchored="yes" n="2">If I understand Aristotle aright, I cannot see how the alternative <foreign lang="greek">εἴτε μὴ εἰδότες</foreign> can be fairly and properly included in this topic; though it might of course be employed by an unscrupulous speaker to delude an unintelligent audience. It seems to me that the forgetfulness or ignorance that anything is due to the person who receives the favour does alter the character of the transaction; that the gift in such a case may be a free gift, and the feeling that prompts it <foreign lang="greek">χάρις</foreign>, disinterested benevolence, and that the <foreign lang="greek">τὶ ἀντί τινος</foreign> does not here fairly apply.</note>: for in both cases (whether conscious or unconscious) it was a mere barter or exchange, and therefore again in this respect no benevolence&rsquo;. <pb n="92"/> </p>
						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">συνέπεσεν] σύν</lemma>, as in <foreign lang="greek">σύμπτωμα</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">συμφόρα</foreign>, marks the &lsquo;coincidence.&rsquo; </p>
						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">συνηναγκάσθησαν</lemma>] The <foreign lang="greek">σύν</foreign> in this compound&mdash;compare Lat. <hi rend="italic">cogere, compellere</hi>&mdash;conveys the notion of bringing close together, squeezing, crowding, and hence of <hi rend="italic">compression, constraint;</hi> and thus enforces the <foreign lang="greek">ἀνάγκη</foreign> of the verb with which it is combined. Compare <foreign lang="greek">συμπιέζειν</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">συμπιλεῖν</foreign> (Plat. Tim.). </p>
						<p>In illustration of the topic <foreign lang="greek">ἀπέδωκαν ἀλλ’  οὐκ ἔδωκαν</foreign>, Victorius very appositely cites the case of Demosthenes and Halonnesus referred to by Aeschines <foreign lang="greek">κατὰ Κτησιφῶντος  83. Ἁλόννησον ἐδίδου</foreign> (Philip offered to <hi rend="italic">give</hi>, make us a present of Halonnesus), <foreign lang="greek">ὁ δ̓</foreign> (Demosthenes) <foreign lang="greek">ἀπηγόρευε μὴ λαμβάνειν, εἰ δίδωσιν ἀλλὰ μὴ ἀποδίδωσιν</foreign> (if the offer is to be regarded as a free gift instead of a repayment), <foreign lang="greek">περὶ συλλαβῶν διαφερόμενος</foreign>: and (in Athenaeus VI 223 D&mdash;224 B) by the orator Cothocides; and the Comic Poets, Antiphanes (<foreign lang="greek">ἐν Νεοττίδι</foreign>), Alexis (<foreign lang="greek">ἐν Στρατιώτῃ</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">ἐν Ἀδελφοῖς</foreign>), Anaxilas (<foreign lang="greek">ἐν Εὐανδρίᾳ</foreign>), and Timocles (<foreign lang="greek">ἐν Ἥρωσιν</foreign>), who ridicule the objection as a mere verbal quibble. The phrase seems to have passed almost into a proverb. Victorius truly observes, &ldquo;maioris tamen ponderis res erat quam videbatur, ut ex hoc quoque loco intelligitur.&rdquo; Demosthenes seems to have advised his Athenians to refuse the offer as a <hi rend="italic">gift</hi>, and only to accept it as a <hi rend="italic">repayment</hi> of an outstanding obligation. The argument derived from Aristotle's topic when applied to the case would be different. This offer is prompted by no <foreign lang="greek">χάρις</foreign> or kindly feeling, as Philip represents it; for it is no free gift but the mere payment of a debt. Consequently he is <foreign lang="greek">ἀχάριστος</foreign>, and we owe him no <foreign lang="greek">χάρις</foreign>, or gratitude, in return. </p>
						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">οὐδ’  οὕτως</lemma>] &lsquo;neither in this way&rsquo;. &lsquo;<hi rend="italic">Neither</hi> in <hi rend="italic">this</hi> way&rsquo; (i.e. in the two last cases of intentional or even unintentional repayment, included as one under the head of <hi rend="italic">repayment</hi>), is it true <foreign lang="greek">χάρις</foreign>, <hi rend="italic">any more than</hi> in the two preceding, where the act is (1) not disinterested, or (2) accidental or compulsory. </p>
					</div3>
					<div3 id="b2c7s6" type="section" n="6">
						<p>&lsquo;And (in estimating the value of the feeling or act of benevolence) we must examine it under all the Categories; for <foreign lang="greek">χάρις</foreign> may be referred to that of substance (the fact) or quantity, or quality, or time, or place&rsquo;. Schrader has illustrated the first three of these, but examples are hardly necessary where they so readily suggest themselves. Brandis, in the tract so often cited [<hi rend="italic">Philologus</hi> IV i], p. 26, observes on this passage, that though there can be no doubt that when Aristotle wrote this he had the list of categories lying before him, whether or no the <hi rend="italic">book</hi> was then written cannot be decided. </p>
						<p>&lsquo;And it is a sign (of the <foreign lang="greek">ἀχαριστία</foreign>, the absence of benevolent feeling, that there was no intention of obliging us, and that we therefore owe <pb n="93"/> them no thanks), if people have previously refused a smaller service<note anchored="yes">Toup, quoted by Gaisford, very unnecessarily conjectures <foreign lang="greek">εἰ ἔλαττον μὲν</foreign>, &lsquo;si minus dederint quam par esset.&rsquo;</note>&rsquo;, because it is clear that they must have had some interested motive in conferring the greater, which destroys the favour: &lsquo;or if they have done the same or equal or greater to our enemies; for it is plain that here again the service was not disinterested&rsquo;, was not done for our sake. &lsquo;Or if the service was worthless, and the doer of it knew it to be so&rsquo;;&mdash;(like the &lsquo;Calabrian host&rsquo; and his pears, <hi rend="italic">porcis comedenda</hi>, which he tries to force upon his unwilling guest; Hor.

						<p>Pity, according to the popular definition, which is all that Rhetoric requires, is a feeling of pain that arises on the occasion of any evil, or suffering, manifest, evident (<hi rend="italic">apparent</hi>, to the eye or ear), deadly or (short of that) painful, when unmerited; and also of such a kind as we may expect to happen either to ourselves or to those near and dear to us, and that when it seems to be near at hand: for it is plain that any one who is capable of feeling (<hi rend="italic">lit.</hi> is to feel) the emotion of pity must be such as to suppose himself liable to suffer evil of some kind or other, himself or his friends; and evil of that kind which has been stated in the definition, or like it, or nearly like it. </p>
						<p>On <foreign lang="greek">φαινομένῳ</foreign> = <foreign lang="greek">φανερῷ</foreign>, evident, unmistakable, see note on p. 10 (II 2. 1). Victorius understands it to mean &ldquo;quod nobis malum videatur: possemus enim in hoc falli, atque eam miseriam esse iudicare quae minime sit.&rdquo; But this surely would be expressed by <foreign lang="greek">δοκεῖν</foreign>, not <foreign lang="greek">φαίνεσθαι</foreign>: and to say nothing of the numerous examples by which the other interpretation is supported, (some of which are given in the note above referred to,) this seems to be more appropriate to what follows, and to the nature of the <foreign lang="greek">πάθος</foreign> itself: for the feeling of pity is strong in proportion to the vividness with which the suffering is brought home to us<note anchored="yes" n="2">A remark of Lessing, at the end of the first section of his <hi rend="italic">Laokoon</hi>, will serve as a commentary on Aristotle's <foreign lang="greek">φαινομένῳ</foreign>. &ldquo;<hi rend="italic">Alles stoische ist untheatralisch; und unser mitleiden ist allezeit dem leiden gleichm&auml;ssig welches der interessirende gegenstand &auml;ussert. Sieht man ihn sein elend mit grosser seele ertragen, so wird diese gross seele zwar unsere bewunderung erwecken, aber die bewunderung ist ein kalter affekt, dessen unth&auml;tiges staunen jede andere w&auml;rmere leidenschaft, so wie jede andere deutliche vorstellung, ausschliesset.</hi>&rdquo;</note>. The actual sight of it, when we <hi rend="italic">see</hi> the effect of the injury (and perhaps also a graphic description of it from an eye-witness), gives it a reality and a force which <pb n="94"/> intensify our sympathy. That this is Aristotle's meaning appears most clearly from a subsequent passage, &sect; 8, where these painful things are enumerated, and are found to be all of them bodily affections: and still more perhaps from &sect; 14, where the effect of <foreign lang="greek">πρὸ ὀμμάτων ποιεῖν</foreign> is described. Aristotle has omitted, designedly or not, all mention of mental suffering: perhaps he thought that not being actually <hi rend="italic">visible</hi> it was incapable of exciting pity. See further on this in note on II 8. 8. </p>
						<p>Again, this view of the meaning of the word is in exact agreement with a preceding observation upon pain, II 4. 31, that &lsquo;all painful things are objects of sense, (that is, all feelings which can properly be called painful are excited by sensible objects,)<note anchored="yes">This however seems to require some qualification: it is true of course of all bodily pain; but are not certain mental states, as doubt, suspense, uncertainty, disappointment, also painful? In the case of <foreign lang="greek">ἔλεος</foreign>, Ar. probably means that at least some sensible image, a mental representative, or <foreign lang="greek">φαντασία</foreign>, proceeding from some object of sense, is required to excite the painful feeling. But surely we can pity the mental as well as the bodily sufferings of a friend, provided he makes them sufficiently distinct and intelligible to us.</note> and the greatest evils, as wickedness and folly, are the least sensible; for the presence of vice causes no pain&rsquo;. Victorius, who however does not refer to this passage, has pointed out that the kind of evil which excites pity is distinguished and limited by the epithets <foreign lang="greek">φθαρτικῷ καὶ λυπηρῷ</foreign>; which upon the principle laid down in c. 4. 31 excludes the greatest evils, moral and intellectual, as objects of pity. </p>

VII &sect; 22, ed. 1875]. Compassion, according to him, is one of the benevolent affections, a group subordinate to the family of Tender Emotions. This appears to be a juster view of the nature and connexion of the feeling than the account given by Aristotle. The fact is, as I have elsewhere stated<note anchored="yes" n="2"><hi rend="italic">Review of Aristotle's System of Ethics</hi>, 1867, p. 52.</note>, that the conception of general benevolence and love and duty to our fellow-creatures, is of modern and Christian origin, and finds no place in Aristotle's Ethical System: the <foreign lang="greek">χάρις</foreign> of the preceding chapter includes but <pb n="95"/> a small part of it, being in fact confined to doing a service to a friend in need. Again the limitation of pity to those sufferings to which we ourselves or our friends are exposed, ascribes a selfishness to the emotion which seems not necessarily to belong to it. In fact if this were true, the God of the Christian, and the gods of the heathen would be alike incapable of it. Hobbes, in accordance with his theory of universal selfishness, goes beyond Aristotle in attributing the feeling solely to self-love. <hi rend="italic">Leviathan</hi>, Pt. I. c. 6, &lsquo;Grief for the calamity of another is Pity; and ariseth from the imagination that the like calamity may befall himself; and therefore is called also Compassion, and in the phrase of this present time a Fellow-feeling. And therefore&rsquo; (he continues, another point of contact with Aristotle,) &lsquo;for calamity arising from great wickedness the best men have the least pity; and for the same calamity those have pity that think themselves least obnoxious to the same.&rsquo; [Hobbes, as is well known, analysed Aristotle's treatise in his <hi rend="italic">Brief of the Art of Rhetorick</hi>, first printed <hi rend="italic">with</hi> date in 1681. The <hi rend="italic">Leviathan</hi> was published in 1651. S.] </p>
						<p>The Stoic definition, quoted by Victorius from Diog. Laert., Zeno, VII 1, is in partial agreement with that of Aristotle, but omits the last clause; <foreign lang="greek">ἔλεός ἐστι λύπη ὡς ἐπὶ ἀναξίως κακοπαθοῦντι</foreign>. Whence Cicero, Tusc. Disp. IV 8. 18, <hi rend="italic">misericordia est aegritudo ex miseria alterius iniuria laborantis.</hi> But the Stoics, though they thus defined pity, nevertheless condemned the exercise of it: Diog. Laert., u. s., &sect; 123, <foreign lang="greek">ἐλεήμονας μὴ εἶναι συγγνώμην τ’  ἔχειν μηδενί· μὴ γὰρ παριέναι τὰς ἐκ τοῦ νόμου ἐπιβαλλούσας κολάσεις, ἐπεὶ τό γ̓ εἴκειν καὶ ὁ ἔλεος αὐτή θ̓ ἡ ἐπιείκεια οὐδένειά ἐστι ψυχῆς πρὸς κολάσεις προσποιουμένη χρηστότητα· μηδ̓ οἴεσθαι σκληροτέρας αὐτὰς εἶναι</foreign>. &ldquo;Pity, anger, love&mdash;all the most powerful social impulses of our nature&mdash; are ignored by the Stoics, or at least recognised only to be crushed.&rdquo; Lightfoot, Dissert.

						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">καὶ διαπεφευγότες</lemma>] This is a remarkable exemplification of that rule of Rhetoric, that every question has two sides, of which either may be maintained indifferently according to circumstances, and that all its materials and reasonings are confined to the sphere of the probable. Here we have a flat contradiction of the statement in the chapter on <foreign lang="greek">φόβος</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">θάρσος</foreign>, II 5. 18, where we are told that repeated escape from danger is a ground of confidence.

						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">οἱ δειλότεροι μᾶλλον</lemma>] It is quite possible to find a distinct meaning for both these comparatives and not regard them as mere tautology. The comparative in Greek, Latin, English, when it stands alone, with the object of comparison suppressed, has two distinguishable significations; <foreign lang="greek">μᾶλλον</foreign>, for example, is either (1) <foreign lang="greek">μᾶλλον τοῦ δέοντος</foreign>, &lsquo;<hi rend="italic">too</hi> much&rsquo;, (<hi rend="italic">ne quid nimis</hi>), more than it ought to be; or (2), what we express by &lsquo;rather&rsquo;, (itself a comparative of <hi rend="italic">rathe</hi> &lsquo;early&rsquo;&mdash;comp.

						<p>&lsquo;We have now stated the moods of mind in which men are inclined to pity; what the objects of pity are, is plain to be seen from the definition: that is, of things which cause pain and suffering all are pitiable that are also destructive, and (in fact) everything that is destructive and ruinous; and all evils of which chance is the cause, provided they be of sufficient magnitude&rsquo;. </p>
						<p>On <foreign lang="greek">λυπηρὰ καὶ ὀδυνηρά</foreign>, Victorius and Schrader are agreed, that <foreign lang="greek">λυπηρός</foreign> represents <hi rend="italic">mental</hi>, and <foreign lang="greek">ὀδυνηρός</foreign> <hi rend="italic">bodily</hi>, pain or suffering. But it is certain that in ordinary usage either of them can be applied to both. That <foreign lang="greek">λύπη</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">λυπηρός</foreign> include bodily pain appears from the regular opposition of <foreign lang="greek">ἡδονή</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">λύπη</foreign> expressing pleasure and pain <hi rend="italic">in general:</hi> equally so in Aristotle's psychology, where <foreign lang="greek">ἡδονή</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">λύπη</foreign> are the necessary accompaniments of sensation <hi rend="italic">in all animals;</hi> and in Plato's moral philosophy (Gorgias, Phaedo, Philebus, &amp;c.), where they most unmistakably include all kinds of pleasures and pains. <foreign lang="greek">ὀδύνη</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">ὀδυνηρός</foreign>, though most frequently perhaps applied to pain of body (as especially in Homer, also in Plato and in Soph. Phil. 827, <foreign lang="greek">ὀδύνη</foreign> <hi rend="italic">bodily</hi>, opposed to <foreign lang="greek">ἄλγος</foreign> <hi rend="italic">mental</hi>, pain), can also be used to express <hi rend="italic">mental</hi> suffering, as may be seen by consulting Rost and Palm's Lexicon. <foreign lang="greek">Ὀδύνη</foreign>, proprie corporis......transfertur ad animi dolorem (Ellendt, <hi rend="italic">Lex. Soph.</hi> s. v.). The derivation of <foreign lang="greek">ὀδύνη</foreign> from a root <hi rend="italic">ed</hi> &lsquo;eat&rsquo;, <foreign lang="greek">ἔδω, ἐσθίω</foreign> <hi rend="italic">edo</hi>, and of <foreign lang="greek">λύπη</foreign> from a root <hi rend="italic">lup</hi> &lsquo;to break&rsquo;, (Curtius, <hi rend="italic">Grundz. der Gr. Etym.</hi> I. pp. 218, 240,) throws no light upon <pb n="100"/> the distinction between them: both, according to the natural growth of language, have a physical origin, and are transferred by metaphor to the expression of mental affections. But, read by the light of the explanatory &sect; 8, the difficulty is at once cleared up. Only <foreign lang="greek">ὀδυνηρά</foreign> is repeated, which shews that the difference between this and <foreign lang="greek">λυπηρά</foreign> is&mdash;here at all events&mdash; one of expression merely and not of conception. This is confirmed by the details of things painful which are enumerated in &sect; 8, all of them evils affecting the body alone. And this is in fact an explanation of the meaning of <foreign lang="greek">φαινομένῳ κακῷ</foreign> in the definition, that being most evident or palpable which is presented immediately to the sense. Comp. note on <foreign lang="greek">φαινομένῳ</foreign> &sect; 1. </p>
						<p>Of <foreign lang="greek">ἀναιρετικά</foreign> Victorius says that it is not in itself precisely distinguishable in sense from <foreign lang="greek">φθαρτικά</foreign>, but (as I have expressed in the translation) the latter term applies only to some particular cases of <foreign lang="greek">λυπηρά</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">ὀδυνηρά</foreign>, whilst <foreign lang="greek">ἀναιπετικά</foreign> is extended to <hi rend="italic">all things</hi> destructive. </p>

						<p>The three last of the evils mentioned, <foreign lang="greek">αἶσχος, ἀσθένεια, ἀναπηρία</foreign>, occur again, as Victorius notes (without the reference, which is also omitted by Gaisford who quotes him), Eth. N. III 7, 1114 <hi rend="italic">a</hi> 22, seq., in a passage (which will serve as a partial commentary on the text of the Rhetoric) in which the distinction is drawn between defects and injuries bodily and mental as <hi rend="italic">misfortunes</hi>, due to nature or accident, and the same when we have brought them on ourselves by carelessness or vice. Thus <foreign lang="greek">αἰσχρότης</foreign> or <foreign lang="greek">αἶσχος</foreign> may be due to nature, <foreign lang="greek">διὰ φύσιν</foreign>, or to the neglect of athletic exercises, <foreign lang="greek">ἀγυμνασίαν</foreign>, or carelessness in general, <foreign lang="greek">ἀμέλειαν</foreign>: in the former case it is the object not of censure but of pity; in the latter it is to be blamed. The same may be said of <foreign lang="greek">ἀσθένεια</foreign>, and <foreign lang="greek">πήρωσις</foreign>, the equivalent of <foreign lang="greek">ἀναπηρία</foreign> in the Rhetoric; the instance of the mutilation or crippled condition there given is <hi rend="italic">blindness;</hi> &lsquo;no one would reproach a man blinded either by nature or disease or a blow, but would rather pity him; but if <pb n="101"/> the blindness proceeded from drunkenness or any other form of licentiousness every one would condemn it&rsquo;. We have here the necessary qualification supplied which limits and distinguishes the cases in which ugliness, weakness and mutilation are really pitiable. </p>
						<p>&lsquo;And when an ill result follows from what might naturally have been expected to lead to good&rsquo;, i. e. when in any enterprise or course of action, we have done everything that seemed likely to ensure success, and yet fail (or &lsquo;come to grief&rsquo;) in spite of all our endeavours, this again is a misfortune, or piece of <hi rend="italic">ill-luck:</hi> &lsquo;and the frequent repetition of accidents of this kind&rsquo;. </p>

						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">πεπονθότος γενέσθαι</lemma>] for <foreign lang="greek">πεπονθότι</foreign>, the genitive absolute being substituted for the proper case after the verb. This irregularity occurs more frequently in Aristotle than elsewhere. Comp. Rhet. II 23. 7 (this is a doubtful instance), Ib. &sect; 24, <foreign lang="greek">ὑποβεβλημένης τινὸς...ἐδόκει</foreign>. Ib. &sect; 30, <foreign lang="greek">ἅμα εἰρημένων γνωρίζειν</foreign>. Polit.

I 3. 5, <foreign lang="greek">ὡς χεῖρον</foreign>, an absolute case, nomin. or accus., is probably an example of the same irregularity. The same usage occurs not unfrequently in Plato, but generally with the addition of <foreign lang="greek">ὡς</foreign>. See Phaedo 77 E, 94 E, <foreign lang="greek">διανοούμενον ὡς ἁρμονίας οὔσης</foreign>. Rep. I 327 E, <foreign lang="greek">ὡς μὴ ἀκουσομένων οὕτω διανοεῖσθε</foreign>.

This is further illustrated by Matth., <hi rend="italic">Gr. Gr.</hi> &sect; 569. </p>
						<p>Somewhat similar is the very common transition from dative to accusative, and especially when the adjective or participle is joined with an infinitive mood as the subject; in which case it may be considered as a kind of attraction: so Sympos. 176 D, <foreign lang="greek">οὔτε αὐτὸς ἐθελήσαιμι ἂν πιεῖν, οὔτε ἄλλῳ συμβουλεύσαιμι, ἄλλως τε καὶ κραιπαλῶντα ἔτι ἐκ τῆς προτεραίας</foreign>; where the participle is attracted back to <foreign lang="greek">πιεῖν</foreign>. Ib. 188 D, where <foreign lang="greek">δυναμένους</foreign> is similarly attracted to <foreign lang="greek">ὁμιλεῖν</foreign> from <pb n="102"/> the preceding <foreign lang="greek">ἡμῖν</foreign>, with which it ought strictly to agree. Instances of a change (without such attraction expressed, but apparently derived from it by analogy,) from dative (or genitive) to accusative may be found in Elmsley's note on Eur. Heracl. 693. Two of these are, Aesch. Choeph. 408, <foreign lang="greek">μοὶ κλύουσαν</foreign>, and Soph. El. 479, <foreign lang="greek">ὕπεστί μοι θράσος...κλύουσαν</foreign>. Add Plat. Rep.

						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">Διοπείθει</lemma>] This reference to the death of Diopeithes, commander of the Athenian troops who defended the Thracian Chersonese against the incursions of Philip, B.C. 342&mdash;341, see Grote, <hi rend="italic">Hist. of Gr.</hi> [Chap. 90] Vol. XI p. 622 seq., furnishes one additional item of evidence, hitherto I believe unnoticed, as to the date of publication of the Rhetoric. Demosthenes defended Diopeithes and his conduct against the Philippizing party at Athens in the speeches <foreign lang="greek">περὶ τῶν ἐν Χερρονήσῳ</foreign> and the third Philippic, both spoken in the last half of 341. Grote, u. s., p. 624. The earliest date assignable to the death of Diopeithes is consequently 340 B.C. This may be added to the passages, which go to fix the date of this work, cited in the Introd. p. 37 seq. Little more is known of Diopeithes: the references to him in Demosthenes are collected by Baiter and Sauppe, <hi rend="italic">Oratores Attici</hi> III. <hi rend="italic">Ind. Nom.</hi> p. 40. Most of them occur in the two speeches above mentioned: he is referred to again in the letter attributed to Philip (Orat. 12), and de Cor. &sect; 70, as the author of a certain <foreign lang="greek">ψήφισμα</foreign> together with Eubulus and Aristophon. In the Schol. on Demosth. (Baiter and Sauppe, u. s., III p. 72 <hi rend="italic">b</hi> 17) <foreign lang="greek">περὶ τῶν ἐν Χερρονήσῳ</foreign>, we have the following notice, <foreign lang="greek">οὗτος ὁ Διοπείθης</foreign> (there are three others named in the Orators) <foreign lang="greek">πατὴρ ἦν Μενάνδρου τοῦ κωμικοῦ ὁ δὲ Μένανδρος φίλος ἦν Δημοσθένους, δἰ ὃν ὑπὲρ Διοπείθους βουλεύεται</foreign>. [See however A. Schaefer's <hi rend="italic">Demosthenes</hi> II 422, where the father of Menander is identified with Diopeithes of <hi rend="italic">Cephisia</hi> and not with Diopeithes of <hi rend="italic">Sunium</hi>, the general referred to in the text.] Compare also Clinton, <hi rend="italic">Fasti Hellenici</hi> II 144. </p>
						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">παρὰ βασιλέως</lemma>] The &lsquo;Great King&rsquo;, the king of Persia, as unique amongst sovereigns, and standing alone, far above all the rest who bore the title, appears consequently as <foreign lang="greek">βασιλεύς</foreign>, without the definite article. Being thus distinguished from all other kings, his title, like proper names, and some of the great objects of nature where there is only one of the kind, requires no additional distinction, and consequently the article is omitted.&mdash;The reigning king of Persia was at this time Ochus, who took the name of Artaxerxes (Artax. III.). Diodorus apud Clinton, <hi rend="italic">Fasti Hellenici</hi>, p. 315: on Ochus, ib. p. 316. </p>

					<div3 id="b2c8s12" type="section" n="12">
						<p>&lsquo;These and the like are the things (the ills or sufferings) that we pity: the objects of pity (persons) are our friends and acquaintance&mdash;provided they are not very closely connected with us; for in regard of the latter we are in the same state of mind&rsquo; (have the same feelings, i. e. in this case the feeling of anxiety and alarm) &lsquo;as we are about ourselves when threatened with (the like disaster)&rsquo;, <foreign lang="greek">μέλλοντας</foreign> (<foreign lang="greek">ταὐτὰ πείσεσθαι</foreign>). &lsquo;And for this reason it was that Amasis, as is reported, wept, not at the sight of his son led away to death, but of his friend begging: for this is a spectacle of pity, that of terror: for the terrible is distinct from the pitiable, nay, it is exclusive of pity, and often serviceable for the excitement of the opposite feeling&rsquo;. </p>
						<p>The king of Egypt, here by an oversight called Amasis, was in reality Psammenitus, his successor on the throne. The horrible story of Cambyses' ferocious cruelty here alluded to is told by Herodotus III 14, with his accustomed naivet&eacute;, as if there was nothing in it at all extraordinary or unusual. It will be sufficient to quote in the way of illustration Psammenitus' answer to Cambyses' inquiry, why he acted as Aristotle describes, which will likewise serve as a commentary on <foreign lang="greek">οἰκειότητι</foreign> in our text. <foreign lang="greek">ὦ παῖ Κύρου, τὰ μὲν οἰκήϊα ἦν μέζω κακὰ ἢ ὥστε ἀνακλαίειν, τὸ δὲ τοῦ ἑταίρου πένθος ἄξιον ἦν δακρύων· ὃς ἐκ πολλῶν καὶ εὐδαιμόνων ἐκπεσὼν εἰ πτωχηΐην ἀπίκται ἐπὶ γήραος οὐδῷ. τὰ οἰκήϊα</foreign> are, his <hi rend="italic">son's</hi> death, and his <hi rend="italic">daughter's</hi> humiliation. As to the substitution of Amasis for Psammenitus, Victorius and Buhle think it may be explained either by a slip of memory on Aristotle's part, or by a variation in the story in the account given by other authorities. I have no doubt myself that the true explanation is the former. We have already seen that our author is very liable to misquotation, as I believe to be the case with all or most of those who, having a wide range of reading and an unusually retentive memory, are accustomed to rely too confidently upon the latter faculty. The vague <foreign lang="greek">ὡς φασίν</foreign> confirms this view. If Aristotle had remembered as he set down his example that he had it from Herodotus, it seems to me quite certain that he would have mentioned his name. </p>

He quotes Eth. Nic. III 15, sub fin., (<foreign lang="greek">αἱ ἐπιθυμίαι</foreign>) <foreign lang="greek">ἂν μεγάλαι καὶ σφοδραὶ ὦσιν, καὶ τὸν λογισμὸν ἐκκρούουσιν</foreign>. Plut. p. 1088 A, non posse suaviter vivi secundum Epicurum c. 3, (<foreign lang="greek">πόνος</foreign>) <foreign lang="greek">ὑπ’  ἄλλων πόνων, ὥσπερ ἥλων σφοδροτέρων, ἐκκρουόμενος ἀπαλλάττεται</foreign>, and <pb n="104"/> Cic. Tusc. Disp. IV 35. 75, <hi rend="italic">etiam novo quidem amore veterem amorem, tanquam clavo clavum, eiciendum putant.</hi> <foreign lang="greek">ἧλον ἥλῳ ἐκκρούειν</foreign> is a proverb, occurring three times in Lucian, de merc. cond. c. 9, Vol. I. p. 716, ed. Hemst., pro lapsu inter salut. c. 7, I 733, Philopseudes, c. 24, III 39, <foreign lang="greek">ἥλῳ, φασίν, ἐκκρούεις τὸν ἧλον.ἐναντίῳ</foreign>] sc. <foreign lang="greek">πάθει</foreign>. </p>
						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">χρήσιμον</lemma>] seems to refer to the rhetorical <hi rend="italic">use</hi> of the topic, rather than to the promotion of the feeling itself, to which the word is less appropriate. On the mutual exclusiveness of terror and pity compare I 14. 5 (note), and &sect; 5 of this chapter. The pity and terror therefore, which it is the object of tragedy to excite and purify, Poet. VI 2, can never be simultaneous. </p>
						<p>I will just observe here in passing that these two emotions are appealed to in that branch of Rhetoric which was collectively called <hi rend="italic">affectus</hi> and divided into <hi rend="italic">indignatio</hi> and <hi rend="italic">miseratio</hi>, technically <foreign lang="greek">δείνωσις</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">ἔλεος; δείνωσις</foreign> is otherwise called <foreign lang="greek">σχετλιασμός</foreign> (Rhet. II 21. 10). Though they might be scattered over the whole speech, the proper place for them is the conclusion, the <foreign lang="greek">ἐπίλογος</foreign> or <hi rend="italic">peroratio</hi>, because the impression is then most vivid and intense, and is &lsquo;left behind&rsquo;, like the bee's sting, in the minds of the audience, <foreign lang="greek">τὸ κέντρον ἐγκατέλειπε τοῖς ἀκροωμένοις</foreign> (Eupolis, of Pericles). </p>
						<p>The importance of these to the rhetorician may be estimated by the fact that Thrasymachus, one of the most celebrated of the early writers on Rhetoric, gave his work the title of <foreign lang="greek">ἔλεοι</foreign> (Cicero, <hi rend="italic">miserationes</hi>) referred to by Aristotle, Rhet. III 1. 7, and ridiculed by Plato, Phaedr. 267 C. The <foreign lang="greek">ἔλεοι</foreign> certainly &lsquo;had a wider scope than their name would indicate&rsquo; (Thompson's note ad loc.), for Aristotle expressly mentions in the passage quoted that they included remarks upon language and style. See further on this subject, Introd. p. 367, and 368 note 3. </p>

These &lsquo;mnemonic&rsquo; artifices&mdash;<foreign lang="greek">τὰ μνημονικά</foreign>, &ldquo;mnemonics&rdquo;&mdash;are described in Auct. ad Heren. III. xvi. 29, seq. Such aids to the memory are of two kinds, <hi rend="italic">loci</hi> and <hi rend="italic">imagines;</hi> the former are &lsquo;the places&rsquo;, or compartments, the sequence of which suggests the order or arrangement of the <hi rend="italic">imagines</hi>, which are the &ldquo;forms, marks, images, of the particular things which we wish to remember, such as horse, lion, eagle, &amp;c.&rdquo; The same subject is treated by Cicero, de Orat.

The invention of this <hi rend="italic">are memoriae</hi> is there attributed to Simonides, &sect;&sect; 351&mdash;353. The theory of the art and practice is, that as of all mental impressions those derived from the senses, of which the sight is the keenest and most powerful, are the most distinct, vivid and intense; <hi rend="italic">quare facillime animo teneri posse ea quae perciperentur auribus aut cogitatione, si etiam oculorum commendatione animis traderentur.</hi></note>.

The incident and accompanying circumstances and the effect of Antonius' speech are related by Plut., Vit. Anton. c. 14, from whom Shakespeare may have derived it; and referred to by Quint., VI 1. 31. Suetonius, Jul. Caes. c. 84, gives a very different account of what passed on this occasion. See also Appian, Bell. Civ. II 146 (Schrader). Another example occurs in Aesch.

						<p>&lsquo;And most pitiable of all is the case when men have borne themselves bravely (worthily), at such critical moments, because all these things intensify our commiseration (in three ways), by the appearance they have of being close upon us, and by the suggestion (or impression, <foreign lang="greek">ὡς</foreign>) of <hi rend="italic">unmerited</hi> suffering and by the vivid representation of it (as though it took place before our eyes)&rsquo;. The gender and construction of <foreign lang="greek">ἀναξίου</foreign> <pb n="107"/> are both uncertain; it may be either masc. or neut.; and may be made to agree either with <foreign lang="greek">πάθους</foreign> if neut., or, as I rather think, used as masc. and construed thus; <foreign lang="greek">καὶ ὡς τοῦ πάθους ὄντος ἀναξίου</foreign> (&lsquo;being that <hi rend="italic">of one</hi> who did not deserve it&rsquo;; whose sufferings were unmerited because he was <foreign lang="greek">σπουδαῖος</foreign>) <foreign lang="greek">καὶ ἐν ὀφθαλμοῖς φαινομένου</foreign>: and so I have rendered it.

				<div id="b2c9" type="chapter" n="9">

					<p>The subject of the following chapter, <foreign lang="greek">νέμεσις</foreign>, is briefly noticed by Aristotle, Eth. Nic. II 7 sub fin., together with <foreign lang="greek">αἰδώς</foreign>, as a <foreign lang="greek">πάθος</foreign>, an instinctive emotion, which approaches nearly to a virtue, and may therefore be included in a list of virtues. The detailed description of it, which ought to have followed that of <foreign lang="greek">αἰδώς</foreign> in IV 15, is lost, together probably with some concluding observations leading up to the separate discussion of justice in Bk. V., and justifying its connexion with the other virtues and conformity to the law of the &lsquo;mean&rsquo;, which is barely mentioned in the fifth book as it stands at present. <foreign lang="greek">νέμεσις</foreign> is defined in Eth. N. II 7, as here, <foreign lang="greek">ὁ νεμεσητικὸς λυπεῖται ἐπὶ τοῖς ἀναξίως εὖ πράττουσιν</foreign>, and is placed in the scheme as a mean, or virtuous state of feeling, between <foreign lang="greek">φθόνος</foreign> the excess, and <foreign lang="greek">ἐπιχαιρεκακία</foreign> the defect, of indignation. Of this we shall have to speak further in the explanation of &sect;&sect; 2&mdash;5, which reads like a criticism and retraction of the misstatement of the Ethics, and very much strengthens the evidence of the later composition, as well as publication, of the Rhetoric. See Introd. p. 48. A definition of <foreign lang="greek">νέμεσις</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">φθόνος</foreign> is found likewise in Top. B 2, 109 <hi rend="italic">b</hi> 36, <foreign lang="greek">φθόνος ἐστὶ λύπη ἐπὶ φαινομένῃ εὐπραγίᾳ τῶν ἐπιεικῶν τινός</foreign>, and again, p. 110 <hi rend="italic">a</hi> 1, <foreign lang="greek">φθονερὸς ὁ λυπούμενος ἐπὶ ταῖς τῶν ἀγαθῶν εὐπραγίαις, νεμεσητικὸς δ’  ὁ λυπούμενος ἐπὶ ταῖς τῶν κακῶν εὐπραγίαις</foreign>. Fuller and better than all these is that of Eudemus, Eth. Eud. III 7. 2, <foreign lang="greek">ὁ νεμεσητικός, καὶ ὃ ἐκάλουν οἱ ἀρχαῖοι τὴν νέμεσιν, τὸ λυπεῖσθαι μὲν ἐπὶ ταῖς παρὰ τὴν ἀξίαν κακοπραγίαις καὶ εὐπραγίαις, χαίρειν δ’  ἐπὶ ταῖς ἀξίαις· διὸ καὶ θεὸν οἴονται εἶναι τὴν νέμεσιν</foreign>. Comp. &sect; 2 of this chapter, <foreign lang="greek">διὸ καὶ τοῖς θεοῖς ἀποδίδομεν τὸ νεμεσᾷν</foreign>. </p>
					<p>Of the earlier notion of <foreign lang="greek">νέμεσις</foreign>, alluded to in the foregoing passage, viz. that of divine vengeance or retribution, or the power that exercises it, a good description is found in a fragment of Euripides, Fr. Inc. 181 (Dind.), <foreign lang="greek">ὅταν δ’  ἴδῃς πρὸς ὕψος ἠρμένον τινά, λαμπρῷ τε πλούτῳ καὶ γένει γαυρούμενον, ὀφρῦν τε μείζω τῆς τύχης ἐπηρκότα· τούτου ταχεῖαν νέμεσιν εὐθὺ προσδόκα· ἐπαίρεται γὰρ μεῖζον ἵνα μεῖζον πέσῃ</foreign> [<hi rend="italic">tolluntur in altum, ut lapsu graviore ruant.</hi> Claudian, in Rufinum, I 22.]. </p>
					<p>This doctrine of the <foreign lang="greek">ἀρχαῖοι</foreign> is well illustrated by two stories in Herodotus, that of the interview between Solon and Croesus, I 29&mdash;33, and <pb n="108"/> what followed it c. 34, <foreign lang="greek">μετὰ δὲ Σόλωνα οἰχόμενον, ἔλαβε ἐκ θεοῦ νέμεσις μεγάλη Κροῖσον· ὡς εἰκάσαι, ὅτι ἐνόμιζε ἑωυτὸν εἶναι ἀνθρώπων ἁπάντων ὀλβιώτατον</foreign>: and the story of Polycrates, III 39&mdash;43.

					<p>According to Aristotle's definition of <foreign lang="greek">νέμεσις</foreign> &lsquo;a feeling of pain at undeserved good fortune&rsquo;, it represents the &lsquo;righteous indignation&rsquo;, arising from a sense of the claims of justice and desert, which is aroused in us by the contemplation of success without merit, and a consequent pleasure in the punishment of one who is thus undeservedly prosperous. It is no selfish feeling, &sect; 3; if it had any reference to oneself and one's own interests it would be <hi rend="italic">fear</hi> of evil consequences arising to us from the other's prosperity, and not <hi rend="italic">indignation.</hi> It implies also its opposite, the feeling of pleasure at deserved success or prosperity. In this narrow sense it is treated in the present chapter. It is in fact one form in which &lsquo;moral disapprobation&rsquo;, founded upon the distinction of right and wrong, shews itself in our nature. Aristotle, in classing it with the <foreign lang="greek">πάθη</foreign>, makes it <hi rend="italic">instinctive;</hi> not therefore a virtue, nor necessarily requiring moral cultivation. Of moral approbation and disapprobation see the account given by Butler, at the commencement of his <hi rend="italic">Dissertation on the Nature of Virtue.</hi> He also seems to regard these two as natural instincts, when he says of them, &ldquo;we naturally and unavoidably approve of some actions under the peculiar view of their being virtuous and of good desert; and disapprove others as vicious and of ill desert.&rdquo; See also Serm. VIII. &lsquo;On deliberate anger or resentment.&rsquo; Prof. Bain, <hi rend="italic">Emotions and Will</hi>, p. 321, [Chap. XV &sect; 22, ed. 1875], in treating of &lsquo;moral disapprobation&rsquo;, expresses himself thus; &ldquo;the feeling that rises up towards that person (a guilty agent) is a strong feeling of displeasure or dislike, proportioned to the strength of our regard to the violated duty. There arises a moral resentment, or a disposition to inflict punishment upon the offender,&rdquo; &amp;c. But such an instinctive sense of right and wrong has a much wider scope and sphere of action than Aristotle's <foreign lang="greek">νέμεσις</foreign>, which is confined to one particular class of cases upon which this moral instinct or faculty operates. </p>

						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">τοὺς πατραλοίας καὶ μιαιφόνους λυπηθείη</lemma>] Vater explains the accus. After the passive verb by supposing a change of construction, Ar. having intended to write, <foreign lang="greek">οὐδεὶς ἂν ἐλεήσει</foreign> (sic) <foreign lang="greek">χρηστός</foreign>. This is quite unnecessary. The accus. after passive and neuter verbs, indicative of the local seat of any affection, an extension of the cognate accus., is common enough fully to justify the construction of the text. At the same time there is a difference between such an expression as this, and the ordinary case of the local accus., such as <foreign lang="greek">ἀλγεῖν τὴν κεφαλήν</foreign>. The accus. <foreign lang="greek">κεφαλήν</foreign> directly and properly expresses the seat of the affection as in the subject who himself feels the pain: and this is the ordinary case. But in our text the seat of the pain<note anchored="yes">It is in fact not the pain, but the absence of it, that is here in question: but as this would make nonsense of the illustration, nonentities having no local habitation, I must be allowed to substitute the positive for the negative conception.</note> is transferred from subject to object, the feeling migrating, as it were, and taking up its temporary residence in the parricides and murderers who are the <hi rend="italic">objects</hi> of it. But whatever the true explanation may be, there are at all events several precisely parallel instances&mdash; some of which may be found in Matth. <hi rend="italic">Gr. Gr.</hi> &sect; 414, and Jelf, <hi rend="italic">Gr. Gr.</hi> &sect; 549 c&mdash;quite sufficient to defend this particular use of the accus. Comp. for instance Soph.

Hippol. 1355, <foreign lang="greek">τοὺς γὰρ εὐσεβεῖς θεοὶ θνήσκοντας οὐ χαίρουσιν</foreign>, where the dying are just as much the objects of the joy (or the absence of it) as the murderers are of the pain in the passage before us. Similarly <foreign lang="greek">αἰσχύνεσθαι</foreign>, (frequent in the Rhet. and elsewhere,) as in Eur. Ion 1074, where <foreign lang="greek">αἰσχύνομαι τὸν πολύυμνον θεόν</foreign>, is to feel awe <hi rend="italic">in the presence of</hi> the god; who is the object of this feeling of shame, just as the murderers are of the painful feeling. Victorius thinks that the prepos. <foreign lang="greek">διά</foreign> is <hi rend="italic">understood</hi>, &lsquo;as it often is in the Attic writers, such as Thucydides, Lysias, Aristophanes&rsquo;!

						<p>&lsquo;And all these (<foreign lang="greek">ταῦτα</foreign> is explained by <foreign lang="greek">ὁ γάρ</foreign>, &lsquo;<hi rend="italic">n&auml;mlich</hi>&rsquo;, <foreign lang="greek">κ.τ.λ.</foreign>) belong to the same kind of character (or disposition), and their opposites <pb n="112"/> to the opposite temper; that is to say, it is the same sort of man that takes a malicious pleasure in mischief and that is given to envy; for whenever the acquisition or possession of anything (by another) is painful to a man (envy), he must needs feel pleasure at the privation or destruction of the same (<foreign lang="greek">ἐπιχαιρεκακία</foreign>)&rsquo;. </p>
						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">στέρησις</lemma>, Categ. 10, is one of the four kinds of opposites, relative opposites, contraries (as black and white), state and privation (<foreign lang="greek">ἕξις, στέρησις</foreign>), affirmation and negation. <foreign lang="greek">στέρησις</foreign> is defined ib. 12 <hi rend="italic">a</hi> 26 seq. It is the absence or want of a state which is <hi rend="italic">natural</hi> and usual to that in which the state resides, as sight to the eye: <foreign lang="greek">τυφλὸν οὐ τὸ μὴ ἔχον ὄψιν, άλλὰ τὸ μὴ ἔχειν ὅτε πέφυκεν ἔχειν</foreign>. A man's blindness is a <foreign lang="greek">στέρησις</foreign>, because with him sight is natural: the term is not applicable to animals born without eyes, <foreign lang="greek">ἐκ γενετῆς οὐκ ὄψιν ἔχοντα</foreign>: these cannot properly be said to be deprived of sight, which they never had. <foreign lang="greek">στέρησις</foreign> therefore in the present passage implies a loss of some good which had been previously gained or possessed, and is distinguished from <foreign lang="greek">φθορά</foreign>, as privation or loss from ruin or destruction. Victorius understands <foreign lang="greek">φθορᾷ</foreign> of destruction, decay, as opposed to <foreign lang="greek">γενέσει</foreign> which is implied in <foreign lang="greek">γιγνομένῳ</foreign>; a man may be deprived of or lose a <hi rend="italic">possession</hi>, that which grows may decay and come to nothing, &lsquo;Interitus manifesto generationi alicuius rei contrarius est.&rsquo; I cannot think this interpretation as appropriate as the other: <foreign lang="greek">γίγνεσθαι</foreign>, to come to the possession of something, to gain or acquire it, is properly opposed to <foreign lang="greek">ὑπάρχειν</foreign>, to have it already in possession, long-standing and settled. </p>
						<p>&lsquo;And therefore all these feelings (<foreign lang="greek">νέμεσις, φθόνος, ἐπιχαιρεκακία</foreign>) are obstructive of pity, but different (in other respects) for the reasons already stated; so that they are all alike serviceable for making things appear not pitiable&rsquo;. </p>
						<p>The introduction of these episodical remarks, &sect;&sect; 3&mdash;5, upon the connexion and distinctions of the three <foreign lang="greek">πάθη</foreign> above mentioned, otherwise not easy to explain, may possibly be accounted for, as I have already suggested, by referring them to the statements of Eth. Nic. II 7, 1108 <hi rend="italic">b</hi> 4, which Ar. now sees must be retracted. There they are reduced to the law of the mean by making <foreign lang="greek">νέμεσις</foreign> the mean state of the pleasure and pain felt at our neighbour's good or ill fortune; of which <foreign lang="greek">φθόνος</foreign> is the excess, the pain being felt at all good fortune deserved or undeserved, and <foreign lang="greek">ἐπιχαιρεκακία</foreign> the defect &lsquo;because the feeling falls so short of pain that it is actually pleasure&rsquo;. The words of &sect; 5, <foreign lang="greek">καὶ ἔστι τοῦ ἤθους...ὁ γὰρ αὐτὸς ἐστὶν ἐπιχαιρέκακος καὶ φθονερός, κ.τ.λ.</foreign> are, whether they are intended for it or not, a correction of the blunder made in the Ethics. It is plain enough, as we are here told in the Rhetoric, that the two <foreign lang="greek">πάθη</foreign> in question are but two different phases of the same <foreign lang="greek">ἦθος</foreign> or mental disposition: the same man who feels pain at his neighbour's good fortune <pb n="113"/> will feel pleasure at his misfortunes, and the two cannot be opposed as extremes. Again, the description of <foreign lang="greek">ἐπιχαιρεκακία</foreign> as a defect of <foreign lang="greek">νέμεσις</foreign> and opposite of <foreign lang="greek">φθόνος</foreign> cannot be sustained: the <hi rend="italic">objects</hi> of the two feelings are different: <hi rend="italic">envy</hi> is directed against the <hi rend="italic">good</hi> fortune of another, the <hi rend="italic">malicious pleasure</hi> of the other is excited by his <hi rend="italic">ill</hi> fortune.

					</div3>
					<div3 id="b2c9s6" type="section" n="6">
						<p>&lsquo;Let us begin then with an account of righteous indignation, who, that is, are the objects of it, the occasions that give rise to it, and the states of mind of the subjects of it, and then pass on to the rest (of the <foreign lang="greek">πάθη</foreign>, to what remains to be said of them)&rsquo;. </p>
					</div3>
					<div3 id="b2c9s7" type="section" n="7">
						<p>&lsquo;The first of these is plain from what has been already said, for if righteous indignation is (as it has been defined) a feeling of pain which is roused against any one who appears to enjoy unmerited prosperity, it is clear first of all that this indignation cannot possibly be applied (directed) to every kind of good&rsquo;; (virtue for example and the virtues are exceptions.) </p>
					</div3>
					<div3 id="b2c9s8" type="section" n="8">
						<p>&lsquo;For no one is likely to feel indignant with one who becomes just, or brave, or acquires any virtue in general&rsquo;, (that is, one who by exercise and cultivation attains to any special virtue, or to a virtuous character in general)&mdash;&lsquo;nor indeed is compassion&rsquo; (the plur. <foreign lang="greek">ἔλεοι</foreign> indicates the various acts, states, moments of the feeling) &lsquo;bestowed upon (applied to) the opposites of these&rsquo; (vices, namely, which ought to be the case, if the others were true)&mdash;&lsquo;but to wealth and power and such like, all such things, namely, to speak in general terms (without mentioning possible exceptions, <foreign lang="greek">ἁπλῶς</foreign> opposed to <foreign lang="greek">καθ’  ἕκαστον</foreign>), as the good (alone) deserve&rsquo;. </p>
						<p>So far the meaning is clear; the good as a general rule are entitled to the enjoyment of wealth and power and the like, and when they <hi rend="italic">do</hi> acquire them we feel no indignation because we know they deserve them; it is upon the undeserving that our indignation is bestowed. But as the text stands, and as far as I can see there is no other way of understanding it, there is another class of persons, viz. those who are endowed with natural or personal advantages, such as birth or beauty, which, being independent of themselves and mere gifts of nature, cannot be objects of moral indignation, though they may be of envy, who are coupled with the morally good as deserving <pb n="114"/> of wealth and power. This however cannot possibly be Aristotle's meaning: birth and beauty certainly have no claim <hi rend="italic">per se</hi> to any other advantages. When a bad man makes his way to wealth or power, we infer that they have been acquired by fraud or injustice, and thence that he is undeserving of them, which excites our indignation; but no such inference can be drawn from the possession of birth or beauty, there is no such thing as illicit, or undeserved possession of them. Aristotle seems to have meant, what Victorius attributes to him, that, besides moral excellence, <hi rend="italic">natural</hi> gifts and excellences are also exempt from righteous indignation, for the reason above given&mdash;that they <hi rend="italic">are</hi> gifts of nature, and the possessors are in no way responsible for them: and this is fully confirmed by the connexion of what immediately follows. Bekker, Spengel, Buhle and the rest are alike silent upon the difficulty, and Victorius, though he puts what is probably the right interpretation upon the passage, has not one word to shew how such interpretation can be extracted from the received text. </p>

						<p>&lsquo;And seeing that antiquity (possession of long standing) appears to be a near approach to a natural gift or endowment&rsquo; (i. e. to carry with it a claim or right, nearly approaching to that conferred by nature), &lsquo;of two parties, that have possession of the same good, the one that has come by it recently, and thereby attained his prosperity, provokes the higher degree of indignation: for the <hi rend="italic">nouveaux riches</hi> give more offence than those whose wealth is transmitted from olden time and by right of family (or inheritance): and the like may be said of magistracies (offices of state), of power (in general), of abundance of friends, of happiness in children (a fair and virtuous family), and anything else of the same sort. Or again, any other good that accrues to them, due to the same causes; for in fact in this case again the newly enriched who have obtained office by their wealth (been promoted in consequence of their wealth) give more pain (or offence) than those whose wealth is hereditary.

The apodosis of <foreign lang="greek">ἐπεί</foreign> is <foreign lang="greek">νεμεσητόν</foreign> at the end of the second paragraph. The unnecessary <foreign lang="greek">οὖν</foreign> has crept in like the apodotic <foreign lang="greek">δέ</foreign>, in the <hi rend="italic">resumption</hi> of a previous statement, (on which see I 1. 11, note on <foreign lang="greek">δῆλον δέ</foreign>, Vol. I. p. 20)&mdash;after the parenthetical illustrations; the protasis is forgotten, or overlooked in the writer's haste, and a new sentence introduced by <foreign lang="greek">οὖν</foreign> terminates with the apodosis. I have collected a number of examples of similar irregularities from our author's writings. I will here only quote those that illustrate this particular form of oversight. <foreign lang="greek">ἐπεὶ δέ... τὰ μὲν οὖν</foreign>, Top. <foreign lang="greek">Θ</foreign> 8, 160 <hi rend="italic">a</hi> 35. <foreign lang="greek">ἐπεὶ ἀναγκαῖον</foreign> ... and after five lines, <foreign lang="greek">τῆς μὲν οὖν θύραθεν</foreign>, de Somn. et Vig. c. 3, sub init. <foreign lang="greek">ἐπεὶ δέ...ἀνάγκη οὖν</foreign>... Rhet. II 11. 1. <foreign lang="greek">εἰ γάρ, ...ἀνάγκη δή</foreign>, Phys. VI 4 init., 234 <hi rend="italic">b</hi> 10, 15. <foreign lang="greek">ἐπεὶ δέ...ὅπου μὲν οὖν</foreign>, Pol.

The remainder are cases of <foreign lang="greek">εἰ δή ὥστε, ἐπείὥστε, εἰ οὖνὥστε, ἐπεὶ δέδιό</foreign> (!), <foreign lang="greek">ἐπείδῆλον δέ</foreign>, which may be reserved for a future occasion. Meanwhile see Zell on Eth. Nic. VII 14, II p. 324. Spengel in <hi rend="italic">Trans. Bav. Acad.</hi> 1851, p. 34. Bonitz, <hi rend="italic">Arist. Stud.</hi> Pt. II. p. 129 seq. One example cited by Bonitz, p. 131, from de Anima III 3, has a parenthesis of nearly 20 lines between its <foreign lang="greek">ἐπεὶ δέ</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">ὅτι μὲν οὖν</foreign>. On <foreign lang="greek">οὖν</foreign> in resumption, after a parenthesis, &lsquo;well then, as I was saying&rsquo;, see Klotz on Devar. <hi rend="italic">de Partic.</hi> p. 718. Hartung, <hi rend="italic">Partikellehre</hi>, II 22 seq. </p>
						<p>&lsquo;It is matter of indignation also (<hi rend="italic">subaudi</hi> <foreign lang="greek">νεμεσητόν</foreign> from the foregoing clause) for the inferior to compete with the superior, nay and especially where the inferiority and superiority lie (or manifest themselves) in the same department, province, study or pursuit&rsquo;. With <foreign lang="greek">τοὺς ἐν τῷ αὐτῷ</foreign> must be understood <foreign lang="greek">ἥττονας καὶ κρείττονας</foreign> from the preceding. The case here described is that of an indifferent artist, painter or sculptor, setting himself up as the rival of Apelles or Phidias; of Marsyas and Apollo; of the frog and the ox in the fable. </p>
						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">μάλιστα μὲν οὖν</lemma>] The <foreign lang="greek">μέν</foreign> in this phrase is the ordinary correlative of <foreign lang="greek">δέ</foreign> in the next sentence, <foreign lang="greek">εἰ δὲ μή</foreign><note anchored="yes">I will venture here to express my conviction that Dr Donaldson is right in the account he gives of these two particles, <hi rend="italic">New Crat.</hi> &sect;&sect; 154, 155; that <foreign lang="greek">μέν</foreign> viz. is the neut. of an older form <foreign lang="greek">μείς, μία, μέν</foreign>, of which <foreign lang="greek">μία</foreign> alone remains in the language, the numeral &lsquo;one&rsquo;; and <foreign lang="greek">δέ</foreign> connected with <foreign lang="greek">δύο</foreign> &lsquo;two&rsquo;; though as far as I know he stands alone in the opinion; the origin usually assigned to it being that it is a weaker form of <foreign lang="greek">δή</foreign>. Donaldson's view of the primary meaning and derivation of these particles is so completely in accordance with all their actual usages, and is so simple and natural, that it seems to me to carry with it its own evidence, and to need no further proof of its truth.</note>. The other particle, <foreign lang="greek">οὖν</foreign>, though its <pb n="117"/> precise meaning in this context may not be quite certain, and it is somewhat unusual in this collocation, is nevertheless fully justified by similar examples to be quoted immediately. The origin of the particle is, as it seems to me, as yet unexplained. It has been traced to various roots, as may be seen by consulting Donaldson, <hi rend="italic">New Cratylus</hi> &sect; 189, Klotz on Devar. <hi rend="italic">de Partic.</hi> p. 717 seq., Hartung, <hi rend="italic">Partikell.</hi> II 8, Doderlein, and Rost, in Rost and Palm's <hi rend="italic">Lex.</hi>, but in none of these derivations have I been able to find any intelligible connexion with the actual senses of the word. Yet until we know the root of the word and its affinities, we shall hardly be able to trace historically the various senses which diverge from its primary meaning. It is a connective particle, which draws an inference or conclusion from something preceding, &lsquo;then, accordingly&rsquo;, (1) logically in an argument, and (2) in the continuation of a narrative, the <hi rend="italic">consequence</hi> primarily implied having passed into the mere notion of what is <hi rend="italic">subsequent</hi>, &lsquo;that which <hi rend="italic">follows</hi>&rsquo;, in both its senses. Hence in all Greek authors <foreign lang="greek">μὲν οὖν</foreign> is habitually employed in this second sense, like the French &lsquo;or&rsquo;, and our &lsquo;now&rsquo; or &lsquo;then&rsquo;, to impart a slight degree of liveliness and animation to a continuous narrative or discussion. From the first or inferential signification, it acquires this intermediate sense of, &lsquo;so then&rsquo;, &lsquo;well then&rsquo;, &lsquo;accordingly&rsquo;, which lies halfway between the logical and the temporal application; just like our &lsquo;then&rsquo;, which has both these senses, only derived in the reverse order, the particle of time in the English &lsquo;then&rsquo;, passing from the temporal to the logical use. For this <foreign lang="greek">μὲν οὖν</foreign> at the commencement of a new paragraph the orators&mdash;Demosthenes in particular, with whom <foreign lang="greek">μὲν οὖν</foreign> is comparatively rare, Aeschines in a less degree&mdash;often substitute <foreign lang="greek">τοίνυν</foreign> or <foreign lang="greek">μὲν τοίνυν</foreign>, which is used precisely in the same way. &ldquo;<foreign lang="greek">μὲν οὖν</foreign>, in continuando sermone cum quadam <hi rend="italic">conclusionis</hi> significatione usurpatur.&rdquo; Hermann ad Viger. note 342. </p>
						<p>The other prevailing signification of <foreign lang="greek">μὲν οὖν</foreign> when used in combination, which, though by no means confined to them, is found chiefly in dialogues as those of Plato and Aristophanes&mdash;in the former most frequently in the familiar <foreign lang="greek">πάνυ μὲν οὖν</foreign>&mdash;has a negative corrective sense conveying an emphatic assertion, sometimes to be rendered by a negative; being employed to correct, in the way of strengthening or heightening, a previous statement or assertion; and while it assents to a proposition indicates an advance beyond it. Dem. de Cor. &sect; 316, <foreign lang="greek">διὰ τὰς εὐεργεσίας, οὔσας ὑπερμεγέθεις, οὐ μὲν οὖν εἴποι τις ἂν ἡλίκας</foreign>. Ib. &sect; 130, <foreign lang="greek">ὀψὲ γάρ ποτεὀψὲ λέγω; χθὲς μὲν οὖν καὶ πρῴην κ.τ.λ.</foreign> Aesch. Eum. 38, <foreign lang="greek">δείσασα γὰρ γραῦς οὐδέν, ἀντίπαις μὲν οὖν</foreign>. Eur. Hippol. 1012, <foreign lang="greek">ματαῖος ἆρ’  ἦν, οὐδαμοῦ μὲν οὖν φρενῶν</foreign>. In all these cases it may be translated &lsquo;nay more&rsquo;, or &lsquo;nay rather&rsquo;. Similarly in answers it expresses a strong assent, <foreign lang="greek">πάνυ μὲν οὖν, μάλιστα μὲν οὖν, κομιδῇ μὲν οὖν</foreign>, &lsquo;just so&rsquo;, &lsquo;quite so&rsquo;, &lsquo;exactly so&rsquo;. In all these cases it may be rendered &lsquo;<hi rend="italic">immo</hi>&rsquo;, &lsquo;nay rather&rsquo;. Herm. ad Vig. n. 343. In the same <pb n="118"/> sense it appears in the Aristophanic <foreign lang="greek">ἐμοῦ μὲν οὖν, ἐμοῦ μὲν οὖν</foreign>, &lsquo;no, mine; no mine&rsquo;, in answer to Cleon's nauseous offer to the Demus, Equit. 911; and elsewhere. <foreign lang="greek">πάνυ μὲν οὖν</foreign> is to be explained thus; I not only assent to what you say, but I go farther, I am absolutely convinced of it; &lsquo;nay more (or nay rather), absolutely so&rsquo;. The <foreign lang="greek">οὖν</foreign> in all these instances, and others like them, conveying thus a strong emphasis, at the same time may be considered to retain its consequential sense, &lsquo;conclusionis significationem&rsquo;, indicative of what <hi rend="italic">follows</hi>, something else, &lsquo;accordingly&rsquo;, which is contained in the assent to the preceding statement, and thus the two usages of it are connected. The <foreign lang="greek">μέν</foreign> in the combination of the two particles is explained by Dr Donaldson, <hi rend="italic">New Cratylus</hi> &sect; 154&mdash;rightly I think &mdash;by a tacit reference to some suppressed sentence with the correlative <foreign lang="greek">δέ, μέν</foreign> being always opposed to <foreign lang="greek">δέ</foreign> expressed or understood. <foreign lang="greek">πάνυ μὲν οὖν</foreign> would imply <foreign lang="greek">ἄλλως δὲ οὔ</foreign>. (Donaldson supplies <foreign lang="greek">τί δ’  ἔπειτα</foreign>; &lsquo;but what then?&rsquo;) Following this explanation we may render <foreign lang="greek">μάλιστα μὲν οὖν</foreign> in our text &lsquo;nay more, most of all, in the highest degree&rsquo;. </p>
						<p>I will now conclude this long note on a phrase which I have never seen fully explained, with a few examples parallel to that of our text. Soph. Ant. 925, <foreign lang="greek">ἀλλ’  εἰ μὲν οὖν τάδ̓ ἐστιν ἐν θεοῖς καλά......εἰ δ̓ οἵδ̓ ἁμαρτάνουσι κ.τ.λ.</foreign> Plato, Phaedo 90 E, <foreign lang="greek">ἀνδριστέον καὶ προθυμητέον ὑγιῶς ἔχειν, σοὶ μὲν οὖν καὶ τοῖς ἄλλοις κ.τ.λ.</foreign>, on which Stallbaum, not. crit., observes, <foreign lang="greek">οἶν</foreign> <hi rend="italic">utpote de vitio suspectum seclusimus.</hi> With what reason, we have seen. Eth. Nic. VI 7, init. <foreign lang="greek">ἐνταῦθα μὲν οὖν</foreign>, where <foreign lang="greek">οὖν</foreign>, as here, seems to be superfluous, and is certainly unusual. Ib. VII 9, 1151 <hi rend="italic">a</hi> 14, <foreign lang="greek">ἐκεῖνος μὲν οὖν εὐμετάπειστος, ὁ δ’  οὔ</foreign>. Polit. I 2, 1252 <hi rend="italic">b</hi> 29, <foreign lang="greek">γινομένη μὲν οὖν τοῦ ζῇν ἕνεκεν, οὖσα δὲ τοῦ εὖ ζῇν</foreign>. Ib. IV (VII) 10, sub init., <foreign lang="greek">τὰ μὲν οὖν περὶ Αἴγυπτον Σεσώστριος, ὡς φασίν, οὕτω νομοθετήσαντος, Μίνω δὲ τὰ περὶ Κρήτην</foreign>. De Soph.

Ib. c. 6, 1203 <hi rend="italic">a</hi> 16, <foreign lang="greek">τοῦ μὲν οὖν ἀκρατοῦς...τοῦ δὲ ἀκολάστου κακῶς</foreign>. </p>
						<p>&lsquo;Whence also this saying&rsquo;. Here follow two hexameter lines as an illustration of the foregoing topic; Cebriones, who knew that the divine vengeance falls upon those who attack their superiors, &lsquo;avoided the encounter of Ajax son of Telamon&rsquo;. Il. XI 542. This is followed by a line which is rejected by the recent editors from the text of Homer, but appears again in the Life of Homer, attributed to Plutarch. See Paley's note ad loc. &lsquo;(Chiefly in the <hi rend="italic">same</hi> art, profession, or pursuit), <pb n="119"/> or if not in the same, any case whatsoever of competition of inferior with superior (understand <foreign lang="greek">ἀμφισβητῇ</foreign>); of a musician, for instance, with a just man (&ldquo;ut si musicus cum iusto viro <hi rend="italic">de dignitate</hi> contendat.&rdquo; Victorius); because justice is better than music&rsquo;. The claims of the two are unequal, of which the inferior ought to be sensible. &lsquo;So now from all this it is clear what are the objects and occasions of righteous indignation; such they are (as we have described them) and such-like&rsquo;. </p>
						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">οἷς καὶ δἰ ἅ,...δῆλον</lemma>] There is an inaccuracy here in the language, <foreign lang="greek">δῆλον</foreign> should be <foreign lang="greek">δῆλοι</foreign> or <foreign lang="greek">δῆλα</foreign> in agreement with one or other of the antecedents to the relatives; or else <foreign lang="greek">οἷς</foreign> should be <foreign lang="greek">τίσιν</foreign>, and <foreign lang="greek">δἰ ἅ, διὰ τίνα</foreign> or <foreign lang="greek">ποῖα</foreign>. Aristotle, when he wrote <foreign lang="greek">δῆλον</foreign>, seems to have had in his mind his usual formula for designating these two departments of inquiry, in the <foreign lang="greek">πάθη</foreign>, viz. <foreign lang="greek">τίσι καὶ ἐπὶ ποίοις</foreign>. The same oversight occurs again c. 2 &sect; 27, where <foreign lang="greek">οἷς</foreign> &amp;c. is followed by <foreign lang="greek">εἴρηται</foreign>, which is impersonal, and cannot supply an antecedent to <foreign lang="greek">οἷς</foreign>. The mistake is again repeated, c. 10 &sect; 5, and, reading <foreign lang="greek">οἷς</foreign>, in c. 10 &sect; 11. </p>

						<p>We now pass to the third division of the analysis of <foreign lang="greek">νέμεσις</foreign>; the subjects of it, the characters, tempers, states of mind which are especially liable to it. &lsquo;Those who are inclined to this kind of indignation in themselves are, first, such as happen to be deserving of the greatest blessings and at the same time in possession of them; because it is unjust that those who are unlike us should have been deemed worthy of (should have been enabled to attain to) the like advantages&rsquo;. This is against the principle of distributive justice above described, which assigns honours and rewards, &amp;c. <foreign lang="greek">κατ’  ἀξίαν</foreign>. See on &sect; 2, above. The actual <hi rend="italic">possession</hi>, as well as the right or claim to these good things, is necessary to the excitement of the indignation provoked by this comparison. The mere claim without the satisfaction of it would be rather provocative of envy or anger than of <hi rend="italic">righteous</hi> (disinterested) indignation: when a man is satisfied himself, he is then ready to take a dispassionate view of the successes and advantages of his neighbour. When under the influence of personal feeling he is not in a state of mind fit to measure the comparative claims of himself and the other. </p>

						<p>&lsquo;And secondly, such as chance (have the luck) to be good and worthy men, because they both decide aright, and hate all injustice&rsquo;. They have both the faculty and the feeling necessary for the occasion; the intellectual faculty of discernment, and the hatred of all that is <hi rend="italic">wrong</hi>, which are both essential to the excitement of <hi rend="italic">righteous</hi> indignation. On <foreign lang="greek">σπουδαῖος</foreign> and its opposite <foreign lang="greek">φαῦλος</foreign>, see note on I 5. 8. </p>

						<p>&lsquo;Or again, such as are of an ambitious temper, and eagerly striving after certain actions&rsquo; (<foreign lang="greek">πράξεις</foreign>, modes of activity, such as public employments in the service of the state; these are also objects of <pb n="120"/> <hi rend="italic">ambition</hi>, as giving scope for the exercise of special excellences, for the attainment of distinction, of honours, and the like); &lsquo;and especially when their ambition is directed to such objects as the others happen to be unworthy of&rsquo;. The greater a man's ambition, and the stronger his desire of the honours and distinctions which he feels to be due to himself, the deeper his resentment at the unfairness of their attainment by those whom he knows, by comparison with himself, to be undeserving of them. </p>

And this also is the reason why the servile, and mean-spirited, and unambitious, are not inclined to feel indignation; because, that is, there is nothing which they think they <hi rend="italic">do</hi> deserve&rsquo;. </p>

						<p>&lsquo;From all this it is plain what sort of men those are at whose misfortunes, and calamities, and failures, we are bound to rejoice, or (at any rate) to feel no pain: for from the statements already made, the opposites&rsquo; (i.e. opposite cases and circumstances) &lsquo;are manifest: and therefore if the speech put those that have to decide (<foreign lang="greek">κρίνειν</foreign> applicable to all three branches of Rhetoric) in such and such a frame of mind (namely, such as have been described), and shew that those who claim, appeal to, our compassion&mdash;as well as the things (the occasions and circumstances) for which they claim it&mdash;are unworthy to meet with it (in the particular case), or of such a character and reputation in general as to repel it altogether, it is impossible (for the judges or other audience) to feel it&rsquo;. The persons here meant are, according to Victorius, <hi rend="italic">rei et adversarii</hi>, the prisoner under trial, in a criminal, the opponent in a civil case: but besides these the other <foreign lang="greek">κριταί</foreign>, the audiences of public as well as panegyrical orations, must be included, who are equally liable with the judges in a court of law to be unduly influenced by an appeal to the feelings on the part of an unscrupulous advocate or declaimer. <pb n="121"/> </p>

					<p>Envy, the next of the <foreign lang="greek">πάθη</foreign> that comes under consideration, is here defined &lsquo;a painful feeling occasioned by any apparent&rsquo; (i. e. <hi rend="italic">palpable, conspicuous</hi>) &lsquo;good fortune, the possession, namely, (or acquisition) of any of the good things before mentioned&rsquo;&mdash;most likely the &lsquo;good things&rsquo; enumerated in I cc. 5, 6&mdash;&lsquo;which falls to the lot of&rsquo; (<foreign lang="greek">περί</foreign>, <hi rend="italic">lit.</hi> in respect of, in the case of,) those who are like us&rsquo;, (in various ways, detailed in the next section) &lsquo;not for any personal consequences to oneself (understand <foreign lang="greek">γένηται</foreign> or <foreign lang="greek">συμβαίνῃ</foreign>), but solely on their account&rsquo;, because <hi rend="italic">they are</hi> prosperous or successful, and it pains us to see it; usually (not always) because some comparison, some feeling of rivalry or competition, is involved in it, when we contrast our own condition with theirs&mdash;(&ldquo;rival-hating envy&rdquo;, Shakesp. <hi rend="italic">Richard II.</hi> Act I. sc. 3. 131)&mdash;and therefore it is <foreign lang="greek">περὶ τοὺς ὁμοίους</foreign>; commonly has reference to, i. e. is directed against, &lsquo;those like us&rsquo;, with whom, that is, we come into competition in anything. <foreign lang="greek">δἰ ἐκείνους</foreign> is further explained in c. 11. 1, <foreign lang="greek">ὁ δὲ</foreign> (<foreign lang="greek">φθονερὸς</foreign>) <foreign lang="greek">παρασκευάζει τὸν πλήσιον μὴ ἔχειν</foreign> (<foreign lang="greek">τὰ ἀγαθὰ</foreign>) <foreign lang="greek">διὰ τὸν φθόνον</foreign>. Such seems to be the meaning of the definition. [For a consecutive translation of &sect; 1, see p. 123.] </p>
					<p>Victorius, here as before, and again on c. 11. 1, renders <foreign lang="greek">φαινομένῃ</foreign> &lsquo;<hi rend="italic">or</hi> that which <hi rend="italic">appears</hi> to be so&rsquo; in the more ordinary sense of the word. But here at all events it cannot have this meaning, for there is no alternative in Aristotle's text; and without it he is made to say, that it is <hi rend="italic">only</hi> &lsquo;seeming&rsquo; prosperity that gives rise to the feeling. See note on II 2. 1. Again he and Schrader both understand <foreign lang="greek">μὴ ἵνα τι αὐτῷ</foreign>[<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>], &lsquo;not from any dread of loss or danger, or prospect of advantage to oneself, from the other's good fortune&rsquo;, the second of which only is contained in <foreign lang="greek">ἵνα τι αὐτῷ</foreign>; the first would require <foreign lang="greek">μή</foreign> instead of <foreign lang="greek">ἵνα</foreign>; and also is contradictory to what was said in c. 9 &sect; 3, <foreign lang="greek">τὸ δὲ μὴ ὅτι αὐτῷ τι συμβήσεται ἕτερον,οὐ γὰρ ἔτι ἔσται τὸ μὲν νέμεσις τὸ δὲ φθόνος, ἀλλὰ φόβος, ἐὰν διὰ τοῦτο ἡ λύπη ὑπάρχῃ καὶ ἡ ταραχή, ὅτι αὐτῷ τι ἔσται φαῦλον ἀπὸ τῆς ἐκείνου εὐπραξίας</foreign>. </p>
					<p>The definition <hi rend="italic">limits</hi> the objects of the pain, and is thus a <hi rend="italic">second</hi> correction, in addition to the criticism of c. 9 &sect;&sect; 3&mdash;5 (on which see note), of the erroneous language applied to <foreign lang="greek">φθόνος</foreign> Eth. Nic. II 7, sub fin., <foreign lang="greek">ὁ δὲ φθονερὸς...ἐπὶ πᾶσι λυπεῖται</foreign>. </p>
					<p>Envy seems to have been regarded by the ancients as the worst and most distressing of all the painful emotions. <hi rend="italic">Invidia Siculi non invenere tyranni maius tormentum</hi>, says Horace, Epist. I 2. 58. <foreign lang="greek">Σωκράτης τὸν φθόνον ἔφη ψυχῆς εἰναι πρίονα</foreign>; and Menander, <foreign lang="greek">ὁ δὲ τὸ κάκιστον τῶν κακῶν πάντων φθόνος</foreign>, Men. Fr. Inc. XII 6, ap. Meineke, <hi rend="italic">Fragm. Com. Gr.</hi> IV 235 (quoted by Orelli ad loc. Hor.). &ldquo;Of all other affections (envy) is the most importune and continual......It is also the vilest affection and the most <pb n="122"/> depraved; for which cause it is the proper attribute of the devil,&rdquo; &amp;c. Bacon, <hi rend="italic">Essays</hi>, Of Envy, sub fin. </p>
					<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">Φθόνον δὲ σκοπῶν</lemma> (<foreign lang="greek">ὁ Σωκράτης</foreign>) <foreign lang="greek">ὅ τι εἴη, λύπην μέν τινα ἐξεύρισκεν αὐτὸν ὄντα, οὔτε μέντοι τὴν ἐπὶ φίλων ἀτυχίαις οὔτε τὴν ἐπ’  ἐχθρῶν εὐτυχίαις γιγνομένην· ἀλλὰ μόνους ἔφη φθονεῖν τοὺς ἐπὶ ταῖς τῶν φίλων εὐπραξίαις ἀνιωμένους</foreign>. Xen. Mem. III 9. 8 (quoted by Gaisford). Socrates defends this view of envy in the next sentence against the charge of paradox, by asserting that the <hi rend="italic">fact</hi> is true, however paradoxical it may appear: still none but simpletons, <foreign lang="greek">ἠλιθίους</foreign>, are liable to the feeling, no wise man, <foreign lang="greek">φρόνιμος</foreign>, is capable of it. This is in accordance with the doctrine that virtue is nothing but knowledge. However it is plain that it is a mistake to confine the feeling to the good fortune of <hi rend="italic">friends</hi> or those we love; and Aristotle has doubtless improved upon it by substituting his <foreign lang="greek">τοὺς ὁμοίους</foreign>. The so-called Platonic <foreign lang="greek">ὅρος</foreign> runs thus, following Socrates, <foreign lang="greek">λύπη ἐπὶ φίλων ἀγαθοῖς ἢ οὖσιν ἢ γεγενημένοις. Ὅροι</foreign>, 416 D. </p>
					<p>The Stoic definition, <foreign lang="greek">λύπην ἐπ’  ἀλλοτρίοις ἀγαθοῖς</foreign>, Diog. Laert., Zeno, VII 111, which does not define the <hi rend="italic">objects</hi> of the feeling, seems to have been the prevailing form of it. It is repeated by Cicero as Zeno's with additions, Tusc. Disp. IV 8. 17, <hi rend="italic">Invidentiam esse dicunt</hi> (Stoici) <hi rend="italic">aegritudinem susceptam propter alterius res secundas, quae nihil noceant invidenti. Nam si quis doleat eius rebus secundis a quo ipse laedatur, non recte dicatur invidere; ut si Hectori Agamemno: qui autem cui alterius commoda nihil noceant tamen eum doleat his frui, is invidet profecto.</hi> This leaves the objects of the <foreign lang="greek">πάθος</foreign> unlimited, which seems to be the true account of it. So Horace, Ep. I 2. 57, <hi rend="italic">Invidus alterius macrescit rebus opimis.</hi> </p>
					<p>I will conclude this note with two or three more modern definitions. &ldquo;<hi rend="italic">Grief</hi> for the success of a competitor in wealth, honour, or other good, if it be joined with endeavour to enforce our own abilities to equal or exceed him, is called Emulation: but joined with endeavour to supplant or hinder a competitor, Envy.&rdquo; Hobbes, <hi rend="italic">Leviathan</hi>, Of the Passions, Pt. 1, ch. 6. Envy and Emulation, <foreign lang="greek">ζῆλος</foreign>, <hi rend="italic">aemulatio</hi>, usually go together in a classification of the <foreign lang="greek">πάθη</foreign>, being evidently closely connected. See the passages in Diog. Laert. and Cic. above quoted; and so also Aristotle. This definition very nearly approaches to that of Ar., only omitting the <foreign lang="greek">μὴ ἵνα τι αὐτῷ</foreign>. </p>
					<p>&ldquo;Envy&rdquo;, says Locke, <hi rend="italic">Essay</hi>, &amp;c., Bk. II. Ch. 20, <hi rend="italic">Of modes of pleasure and pain</hi>, &ldquo;is an uneasiness of the mind, caused by the consideration of a good we desire, obtained by one we think should not have had it before us.&rdquo; Here again the notion of &lsquo;competition&rsquo; enters into the definition. </p>
					<p>Lastly, Bain, <hi rend="italic">Emotions and Will</hi>, Ch. VII, classes this under the general head of emotions of self, and connects it, like his predecessors, with Emulation, &sect; 9 [p. 105, ed. 2, 1865]. Comparison and the desire of Superiority, lie at the bottom of both Emotions. &ldquo;The feeling of <hi rend="italic">Envy</hi> is much more general in its application. Referring to everything that is desirable in the condition of some more fortunate personage, there is <pb n="123"/> combined a strong wish for the like good to self, with an element of malevolence towards the favoured party.&rdquo; This differs from Aristotle in the introduction of the selfish and the malevolent elements, and removes the unnecessary restriction to cases of competition, by which he has limited its objects and scope. It is I believe a much truer and more philosophical account of the Emotion. </p>
					<p>Bacon's <hi rend="italic">Essay</hi>, Of Envy, has some points in common with Aristotle. Bacon places the sting of envy in the want of something which another possesses. &ldquo;A man that hath no virtue in himself, ever envieth virtue in others. For men's minds will either feed upon their own good or upon others' evil; and who <hi rend="italic">wanteth</hi> the one will prey upon the other; and whoso is out of hope to attain to another's virtue will seek to come at even hand by depressing another's fortune.&rdquo; This introduces Aristotle's principle of rivalry and competition as the foundation of envy. Again, with &sect;&sect; 2 and 5, may be compared, &ldquo;Lastly, near kinsfolk and fellows in office and those that have been bred together, are more apt to envy their equals when they are raised. For it doth upbraid unto them their own fortunes; and pointeth at them, and cometh oftener into their remembrance, and incurreth likewise more into the note of others: and envy ever redoubleth from speech and fame.&rdquo; This arises from their constant association, which gives frequent occasion to envy. &ldquo;Again, envy is ever joined with the comparing of a man's self; and where there is no comparison, no envy; and therefore kings are not envied but by kings;&rdquo; compared with the end of &sect; 5. </p>
					<div3 id="b2c10s1" type="section" n="1">
						<p>&lsquo;The occasions, objects, and mental dispositions, that give rise to envy may be clearly gathered from the definition of it; that it is, viz. a feeling of pain occasioned by manifest or conspicuous good fortune, the accession, that is, of any one of the good things previously mentioned, (chiefly) in the case of any one of those like us, for no personal advantage or gain to ourselves that is likely to accrue from it, but simply on their account: for such as have, or think they have, any like them, i. e. persons similar to themselves, in such things as are likely to bring them into rivalry and competition, will be most subject to the feeling of envy&rsquo;. </p>

						<p>&lsquo;By <hi rend="italic">like</hi> or <hi rend="italic">similar</hi> I mean, those who are of the same race (or are alike in stock), of the same family (relatives), alike in age, in states&rsquo;, mental and bodily (virtues of all kinds, accomplishments, acquirements, and excellences of mind and body, when developed, confirmed and permanent are <foreign lang="greek">ἕξεις</foreign>: <hi rend="italic">qui artibus scientiis et huiusmodi rebus pares sunt</hi>, Victorius: this may be included in the other, more general, meaning), &lsquo;in reputation, in property or possessions&rsquo; (of any kind, <hi rend="italic">patrimonio ac re familiari</hi>, Victorius). This is well illustrated by a passage of Cic. Brutus, c. XLII &sect; 156, quoted by Victorius on &sect; 5. <hi rend="italic">Simul illud gaudeo, quod et aequalitas vestra, et pares honorum gradus, et artium studiorumque finitima vicinitas, tantum abest ab obtrectatione invidiae, quae solet</hi> <pb n="124"/> <hi rend="italic">lacerare plerosque, uti ea non modo exulcerare vestram gratiam sed etiam conciliare videatur.</hi> </p>
						<p>In reality envy is not <hi rend="italic">confined</hi>, as Aristotle seems to say, to these classes of people as objects; nor even to those with whom we are likely to come into competition; it seems rather that there is no limit, within the circle of humanity, to the objects on which it may be exercised. A man may envy a baby its innocence, its health, its rosy cheeks, or the poorest and meanest his health and strength: the feeling of pain which belongs to envy no doubt proceeds from an involuntary comparison of oneself with another, who <hi rend="italic">has</hi> some valuable possession which we happen to <hi rend="italic">want;</hi> and the unsatisfied desire, contrasted with the gratification of it in some one else, friend or foe, good or bad, high or low, in a malevolent disposition&mdash;not in the <hi rend="italic">wise</hi> man, as Socrates has it&mdash;breeds the feeling of pain. Aristotle's definition may be thus summed up: envy is a feeling of pain, excited, usually if not always, by the successful competition of a real or supposed rival. &lsquo;Those also&rsquo; are disposed to it &lsquo;who (have nearly attained to) want but little of complete satisfaction (of possessing every thing desirable)&rsquo;. A long and uninterrupted course of success and prosperity, and the attainment of <hi rend="italic">nearly all</hi> that is desirable, seems to give them a <hi rend="italic">right</hi> to what still remains deficient; and the envy which they would in any case feel of the possession of it by another, gains strength by the contrast with their own deficiency. Here again it is the competition and the comparison of our own condition with that of another, the want and the inferiority, that add a sting to envy. </p>

						<p>&lsquo;And this is the reason why those who undertake great enterprises&mdash; engage in great actions&mdash;and the successful are envious: because they think that all such are carrying off what properly belong to themselves&rsquo;, i. e. the profits, honours, and distinctions to which they are entitled. The difference between this feeling and that of <foreign lang="greek">νέμεσις</foreign> is confined to this, that the latter distinguishes between the deserving and undeserving, the former does not.

						<p>&lsquo;And those who have a pre-eminent reputation for anything, and especially for wisdom or happiness&rsquo;. The latter, says Victorius, on account of its extreme rarity. These three classes, desiring to engross all the success, credit, good fortune, themselves, grudge the acquisition or possession of them by their competitors, or any others. &lsquo;And the ambitious are more prone to envy than the unambitious&rsquo;: because they set a higher value upon honours and distinctions. &lsquo;And the pretenders to wisdom and learning&rsquo; (like the Sophists, <foreign lang="greek">ὁ σοφιστὴς χρηματιστὴς ἀπὸ φαινομένης σοφίας ἀλλ’  οὐκ οὔσης</foreign>, de Soph.

Also the little minded (mean-souled), because to them everything appears great (by comparison)&rsquo;; and therefore an object of desire, which when unsatisfied breeds envy. <foreign lang="greek">μικροψυχία</foreign>, opposed to <foreign lang="greek">μεγαλοψυχία</foreign>, is defined in Eth. Nic. II 7, 1007 <hi rend="italic">b</hi> 22, <foreign lang="greek">περὶ τίμην καὶ ἀτιμίαν ἔλλειψις</foreign>: again IV 7, 1123 <hi rend="italic">b</hi> 10, the <foreign lang="greek">μικρόψυχος</foreign> is described as <foreign lang="greek">ὁ ἐλαττόνων ἢ ἄξιος ἑαυτὸν ἀξιῶν</foreign>, one who rates his claims to honour and distinction too low&rsquo;: and further, Ib. c. 9, sub init. <foreign lang="greek">ὁ μικρόψυχος ἄξιος ὢν ἀγαθῶν ἑαυτὸν ἀποστερεῖ ὧν ἄξιός ἐστι</foreign>. Having this mean opinion of himself and his own merits and deserts, and no power of appreciating what is really great, he is of course likely to over-estimate in others the gifts and advantages which he supposes himself to want, and so becomes indiscriminate in his envy. In I 9. 11, 12, <foreign lang="greek">μικροψυχία</foreign> occurs in a somewhat different sense, that of meanness in general, and especially in the use of money.

A very great superiority or inferiority places a man beyond the reach of envy.

						<p>In this last section there are two or three points requiring consideration which it will be as well to dispatch before proceeding to the translation. The first is, whether we are to read <foreign lang="greek">ἐφ’  οἷς</foreign> or <foreign lang="greek">οἷς</foreign> without the prepos.; and then, what do <foreign lang="greek">ἐφ’  οἷς</foreign> or <foreign lang="greek">οἷς</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">ἐπὶ τίσι</foreign>, severally represent. Spengel, following MS A^{c} retains <foreign lang="greek">ἐφ’  οἷς</foreign>; Bekker in his third ed., for once departs from that MS and reads <foreign lang="greek">οἷς</foreign>, although, as it seems, none of the MSS give any various reading. It seems therefore on this ground preferable to retain <foreign lang="greek">ἐφ’  οἷς</foreign> if we can; and we have next to consider how it is to be interpreted, and how distinguished from <foreign lang="greek">ἐπὶ τίσι. ἐφ’  οἷς</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">οἷς</foreign> are equally irregular after <foreign lang="greek">δῆλον</foreign> (see note on II 9. 11, at the end), and the grammar therefore throws no light upon the reading. As far as the grammar and interpretation are concerned there seems to be no objection to retaining <foreign lang="greek">ἐπί</foreign>. </p>
						<p>We have then to decide whether <foreign lang="greek">οἷς</foreign> or <foreign lang="greek">τίσι</foreign> stands for persons or things; either of which is possible. However if the choice is to be made between them, <foreign lang="greek">τίσι</foreign> seems the more natural representative of persons, and <foreign lang="greek">οἷς</foreign> of things; and so in general, throughout these analyses of the feelings, Aristotle is accustomed to designate the <hi rend="italic">persons</hi> who are the objects of them by the pronoun <foreign lang="greek">τίνες</foreign>. </p>
						<p>Thirdly, there is no objection to <foreign lang="greek">ἐπὶ τίσι χαίρουσιν</foreign> in the sense of &lsquo;<hi rend="italic">at</hi>&rsquo; or &lsquo;by whom they are pleased&rsquo; (lit. <hi rend="italic">upon</hi> whom their pleasure is bestowed or directed), &lsquo;in whom they find pleasure&rsquo;, though the bare <foreign lang="greek">τίσι</foreign> is more usual (possibly this may be Bekker's reason for his alteration [of <foreign lang="greek">ἐφ’  οἷς</foreign>]); and if there were any doubt about it, it would be sufficiently supported by <foreign lang="greek">ἐπὶ ποίοις</foreign> (what sort of <hi rend="italic">persons</hi>) <foreign lang="greek">χαίρειν</foreign>, c. 9. 16. Consequently, as I can see no sufficient reason for altering the text contrary to all manuscript authority, I have retained <foreign lang="greek">ἐφ’  οἷς</foreign>, understanding it of <hi rend="italic">things</hi>, the occasions of joy or delight; and <foreign lang="greek">ἐπὶ τίσι</foreign> of the <hi rend="italic">persons</hi> who excite the feeling in us. <pb n="130"/> </p>
						<p>The next clause, <foreign lang="greek">ὡς γὰρ οὐκ ἔχοντες λυποῦνται, κ.τ.λ.</foreign> presents some difficulty, and Muretus and the <hi rend="italic">Vetus Translatio</hi>, followed by Schrader and Wolf, reject the negative <foreign lang="greek">οὐκ</foreign> (or <foreign lang="greek">μή</foreign> as it stood in the MSS employed in the older editions). This however would make the two opposite feelings of pleasure and pain the <hi rend="italic">same</hi> state or disposition of mind, which I think could not possibly have been Aristotle's meaning. Victorius takes what I believe to be the right view on the point. The meaning will then be, that the negative, the contradictory, of pain, i. e. pleasure (the two never co-existing), is excited by the opposite circumstances to those which are productive of the pain of envy; if pain under particular circumstances is excited by the sight of the good fortune of another, substitute the opposite, ill fortune for good fortune in each case, and you will have the appropriate topics for giving rise to the feeling of pleasure in your audience. This, says Victorius, is <foreign lang="greek">ἐπιχαιρεκακία</foreign>, wanton malice, malevolent pleasure in the misfortunes of others. The above interpretation is at all events free from the objection to which Schrader's is liable, namely that it makes Aristotle say that the same mental state or disposition is painful and pleasurable. The choice between the two depends mainly upon the interpretation of <foreign lang="greek">οἱ τοιοῦτοι</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">πῶς ἔχοντες</foreign>. I understand by the former the <foreign lang="greek">φθονεροί</foreign>, the common character of all the classes distinguished in the analysis; Schrader of the members of the several classes, the ambitious, the prosperous and successful; and in his view these classes must fall under the several &lsquo;states of mind&rsquo; designated by <foreign lang="greek">πῶς, ὡς, οὕτως, ἔχοντες</foreign>, such as ambition; though how it can be applied to others, such as &lsquo;the prosperous and successful&rsquo;, his second instance, he does not inform us. If by the &lsquo;state of mind&rsquo; the <foreign lang="greek">πάθος</foreign> or emotion is meant<note anchored="yes">This is certainly so. Take, for instance, the first words of the following chapter, <foreign lang="greek">πῶς δ’  ἔχοντες ζηλοῦσι</foreign>, the state of mind in which <foreign lang="greek">ζῆλος</foreign> is shewn, or resides: which identifies <foreign lang="greek">ζῆλος</foreign> with the <hi rend="italic">state</hi> in question.</note> (which seems to be Spengel's view), it is quite impossible that two such states, one pleasurable and the other painful, can be the same. Schrader, however, appears to take the <foreign lang="greek">πῶς ἔχειν</foreign> in a different sense, for the character or habit of mind, the mental constitution, which tends to produce such and such feelings; and in this point of view, though ambition (his first instance) may fairly enough be called a disposition of mind, yet I cannot see how the second, the prosperous and successful men, or prosperity and success, can well be included in the designation. </p>
						<p>In conclusion I will transcribe part of his note, that the reader may have the opportunity of deciding for himself; merely adding that manuscript and editorial authority is against his omission of the negative, and that though his interpretation is very plausible at first sight, I doubt whether it can be right, for the reasons stated. &ldquo;Veritas autem huius lectionis e re ipsa quoque fiet manifesta, si per <foreign lang="greek">προτάσεις</foreign> a &sect; 2 ad 9 transeas, et huc illas applices.

						<p>&lsquo;It is plain too what are the occasions, the objects, and the states of mind of such (the envious); that is to say, that the same state of mind which is absent in the painful feeling, will be present in the joy that is excited by the opposite occasions&rsquo; (or thus, &lsquo;whatever may be the state of mind the absence of which manifests itself in, or is accompanied by, pain, the same by its presence on the opposite occasions will give rise to pleasure&rsquo;). &lsquo;Consequently, if we ourselves (i. e. any audience) are brought into that state of mind (envy or jealousy), and those who lay claim to (think themselves deserving of) compassion from us, or any good that they want to obtain from us&rsquo; (as <foreign lang="greek">κριταί</foreign>, judges of any kind, in a disputed claim; but it is equally true of men in general), &lsquo;be such as the above described (i. e. objects of envy), &lsquo;it is plain that they will never meet with compassion&rsquo; (which will apply to <foreign lang="greek">τυγχάνειν τινὸς ἀγαθοῦ</foreign> as well as to <foreign lang="greek">ἐλεεῖσθαι</foreign>) &lsquo;from the masters of the situation&rsquo; (those who have the power to bestow either of them, those with whom the matter rests). </p>

					<p>With envy, as we have seen, is closely connected <foreign lang="greek">ζηλος</foreign> or emulation; both of them originating in the desire of superiority, which manifests itself in rivalry and competition with those who so far, and in that sense, resemble us (<foreign lang="greek">περὶ τοὺς ὁμοίους</foreign>), that we are necessarily brought into comparison with them. Both of them are painful emotions&mdash;the pain arises from the unsatisfied want which they equally imply&mdash;and the difference between them is this, that envy is malevolent; what the envious man <hi rend="italic">wants</hi> is to deprive his neighbour of some advantage or superiority, and do him harm by reducing him to his own level; the pain of emulation springs from the sense of our own deficiencies and the desire of rising to a higher level of virtue or honour: consequently the one is a virtuous, the other a vicious, feeling; emulation leads to self-improvement, and the practice of virtue; the object of envy is nothing but the degradation or injury of another: or, as Aristotle expresses it, emulation aims at the acquisition of good things, envy at <pb n="132"/> the deprivation of them in another, the infliction of harm and loss on one's neighbour. </p>
					<p>Such is Aristotle's account of emulation; according to him the feeling is one, and that virtuous. The Stoics however, as interpreted by Cicero, Tusc. Disp. IV 8. 17, distinguished two kinds of <hi rend="italic">aemulatio:&mdash;ut et in laude et in vitio nomen hoc sit. Nam et imitatio virtutis aemulatio dicitur: et est aemulatio aegritudo, si eo quod concupierit alius potiatur ipse careat.</hi> And again, c. 26. 56, <hi rend="italic">aemulantis, angi alieno bono quod ipse non habeat.</hi> The two definitions differ also in this, that in Ar.'s all emulation is painful and all virtuous; in that of the Stoics, one form of it is virtuous but not painful, the other painful but not virtuous; and in fact it is difficult to distinguish the latter form of it from envy. </p>
					<p>The Stoic definition of Zeno and (apparently) Chrysippus, Diog. Laert., Zeno, VII 111, gives only the painful and vicious form of <foreign lang="greek">ζῆλος, λύπην ἐπὶ τῷ ἄλλῳ παρεῖναι ὧν αὐτὸς ἐπιθυμεῖ</foreign>. Cicero attributes his double definition also to Zeno. </p>
					<p>Hobbes' and Bain's definitions of the affection I have already quoted in the introductory note to Ch. X. Locke, in the chapter there referred to, does not include emulation in his list of &lsquo;Passions&rsquo;, or &lsquo;Modes of pleasure and pain&rsquo;. </p>
					<p>Stewart, <hi rend="italic">Outlines of Moral Philosophy</hi>, Pt. II. Sect. III. 5, has some remarks upon emulation, which he classes with the desires, and not (as Aristotle and others) with the affections. &ldquo;It is the desire of superiority which is the active principle; and the malevolent affection is only a concomitant circumstance.&rdquo; Here he is in accordance with Aristotle. &ldquo;When emulation is accompanied with malevolent affection, it assumes the name of envy.&rdquo; </p>
					<p>&ldquo;Emulation,&rdquo; says Butler, <hi rend="italic">Sermon I.</hi>, On Human Nature, note 4, &ldquo;is merely the desire and hope of equality with, or superiority over others, with whom we compare ourselves. There does not appear to be <hi rend="italic">any other grief</hi> in the natural passion, but only <hi rend="italic">that want</hi> which is implied in desire. However, this may be so strong as to be the occasion of great <hi rend="italic">grief.</hi> To desire the attainment of this equality or superiority by the <hi rend="italic">particular means</hi> of others being brought down to our own level or below it, is, I think, the distinct notion of envy. From whence it is easy to see that the real end which the natural passion, emulation, and which the unlawful one, envy, aims at, is exactly the same; namely that equality or superiority; and consequently, that to do mischief is not the object of envy, but merely the means it makes use of to attain its end.&rdquo; At all events, the malevolent <hi rend="italic">feeling</hi> is a constituent element of the emotion of envy, without which it would not be what it is: though the actual <hi rend="italic">doing mischief</hi> may not be essential to it. </p>
					<p>1. &lsquo;The dispositions of emulation (the states of mind which exhibit it, in which it resides), its occasions and objects, will be clear from what follows&rsquo;. <foreign lang="greek">τὰ ποῖα</foreign> here stands for &lsquo;the sort of things&rsquo; which excite emu<pb n="133"/> lation, usually expressed in these analyses by <foreign lang="greek">ἐπὶ ποίοις</foreign>: <foreign lang="greek">ἐπὶ τίσι</foreign> for the &lsquo;persons&rsquo; or &lsquo;objects&rsquo;, <hi rend="italic">upon</hi> whom it lights, i.e. against whom it is directed, which again is more usually conveyed by the simple <foreign lang="greek">τίσι</foreign>. See however c. 10 &sect; 11, <foreign lang="greek">ἐπὶ τίσι</foreign>, and the note there; and <foreign lang="greek">ἐπὶ ποίοις χαίρειν</foreign> c. 9 &sect; 16. &lsquo;If, namely, emulation is a feeling of pain on the occasion of the manifest (unmistakable) presence of good things, highly valued and possible for ourselves to acquire, (<foreign lang="greek">περί</foreign> in respect of, in the case of, i.e.) belonging to, or acquired by, those who have a natural resemblance to ourselves (in temper, faculties, powers, gifts and accomplishments natural or acquired, or anything which brings them <hi rend="italic">into contrast</hi> with us); not because another has them (which is envy) but because we ourselves have them not (and so, feeling the <hi rend="italic">want</hi>, are anxious to obtain them, in order to raise ourselves to the level of our assumed rival)&mdash; and accordingly, (the latter,) emulation is virtuous and a property of virtuous men, envy on the other hand vicious and of the vicious: for whilst the one is led by his emulation to procure (contrive, manage) for himself the attainment of these goods, the other is led by his envy to manage merely that his neighbour shall <hi rend="italic">not</hi> have them&rsquo;:&mdash;(This is mere malevolence, the desire of harm or loss to another, without any corresponding advantage to oneself. The sentence from <foreign lang="greek">διό</foreign> to <foreign lang="greek">φθόνον</foreign>, is a <hi rend="italic">note</hi> on the distinction of <foreign lang="greek">ζηλος</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">φθόνος</foreign>: the argument is now resumed, and the apodosis commences with the irregular <foreign lang="greek">δή</foreign>, introduced unnecessarily, <hi rend="italic">more Aristotelio</hi>, after the parenthesis as correlative to the <foreign lang="greek">εἰ</foreign> of the <foreign lang="greek">πρότασις</foreign>, see note on II 9. 11, I 1. 11)&mdash;&lsquo;<hi rend="italic">then</hi>, I say (if emulation be such as it has been described), those must be inclined to emulation who think themselves deserving of good things which they do not possess&rsquo;; (sc. <foreign lang="greek">δυνατῶν αὐτοῖς ὄντων</foreign>, provided they are possible for them to attain. This connecting link, omitted by Aristotle, is supplied by Muretus and Victorius, and doubtless explains the connexion of the reasoning,) &lsquo;for no one lays claim to things manifestly impossible&rsquo;. </p>

						<p>&lsquo;And this is why the young and the high-minded are of this character&rsquo;. With <foreign lang="greek">οἱ νέοι</foreign> comp. c. 12. 6 and 11. The latter of these two passages gives the reason why the young are inclined to emulation, it is <foreign lang="greek">διὰ τὸ ἀξιοῦν αὑτοὺς μεγάλων</foreign>; which also makes them <foreign lang="greek">μεγαλόψυχοι</foreign>. Emulation in the <foreign lang="greek">μεγαλόψυχοι</foreign> must be confined to rivalry in <hi rend="italic">great things</hi>, if it is to be consistent with the character assigned to them in Eth. Nic. IV 8, 1124 <hi rend="italic">b</hi> 24, <foreign lang="greek">καὶ εἰς τὰ ἔντιμα μὴ ἰέναι, ἢ οὗ πρωτεύουσιν ἄλλοι· καὶ ἀργὸν εἶναι καὶ μελλητὴν ἀλλ’  ἢ ὅπου τιμὴ μεγάλη ἢ ἔργον, καὶ ὀλίγων μὲν πρακτικόν, μεγάλων δὲ καὶ ὀνομαστῶν</foreign>.

That is to say, they start with the assumption that their natural character is virtuous, and then, because wealth and power and such like have a natural connexion with, i.e. are the proper rewards of, virtue, they are eager to obtain them, and vie with their competitors in the pursuit of them<note anchored="yes" n="2">Brandis, in the tract on the Rhet. in Schneidewin's <hi rend="italic">Philologus</hi>, IV i. p. 46, following apparently the opinion of Muretus and Vater, calls the passage a <hi rend="italic">verderbte Stelle</hi>, for which I can see no foundation whatsoever. The sense and connexion are perfectly intelligible, the imperf. <foreign lang="greek">προσῆκε</foreign> has been explained, and <foreign lang="greek">ἀγαθῶς</foreign> defended by the use of it in the Topics. Bekker, Ed. III., retains the v. l. The version of the <hi rend="italic">Anonymus</hi> (apud Brandis) <foreign lang="greek">ζηλοῦσι γὰρ τὰ τοιαῦτα ἀγαθὰ διὰ τὸ οἴεσθαι αὐτοὺς ἀγαθοὺς εἶναι καὶ διὰ τοῦτο ἔχειν τὰ ἀγαθὰ ἃ προσήκει ἔχειν τοὺς α·γαθούς</foreign>, seems to me to be sufficiently close to the <hi rend="italic">received text</hi> to be intended for a paraphrase of <hi rend="italic">it</hi>, and not (as Brandis thinks) to suggest a different reading.</note>. The meaning of this sentence is further elucidated by comparison with what is said in &sect; 7. We are there informed that some kinds of good things, such as those that are due to fortune, or mere good luck, without merit, may be the objects not of emulation but of contempt. <foreign lang="greek">ἀγαθὰ ἃ τῶν ἐντίμων ἄξιά ἐστιν ἀνδρῶν</foreign> are consequently confined to those good things the acquisition of which implies merit. </p>
						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">προσῆκε</lemma>] imperf. is properly &lsquo;<hi rend="italic">had</hi> a natural claim&rsquo;. The past tense, precisely as in the familiar use of the imperf., &lsquo;so and so <hi rend="italic">is</hi> as I said&rsquo;, referring back to a past statement, here signifies, &lsquo;<hi rend="italic">has</hi> a claim, as they were in the habit of believing&rsquo;. I have not thought it worth while to express this in the transl., as the phraseology is Greek and not English. Muretus, approved by Vater, writes <foreign lang="greek">προσήκει</foreign>, overlooking the force of the imperfect. </p>
						<p>In <foreign lang="greek">ἀγαθῶς ἔχουσι, ἀγαθῶς</foreign> for <foreign lang="greek">εὖ</foreign> is as abnormal as &lsquo;goodly&rsquo; would be, used as an <hi rend="italic">adverb</hi> for &lsquo;well&rsquo;. It occurs once again, Top. E 7, 136 <hi rend="italic">b</hi> 28, <foreign lang="greek">οὐκ ἔστι τοῦ δικαίως ἴδιον τὸ ἀγαθῶς</foreign>. Amongst the Classical Greek writers, Aristotle appears to enjoy the monopoly of it [but the present passage and the parallel just quoted from the Topics are the only instances given in the <hi rend="italic">Index Aristotelicus</hi>]: it is found also in the Septuagint (Stephens' <hi rend="italic">Thesaurus</hi> s. v.), and apparently nowhere else. </p>

						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">λογογράφοι</lemma>. This word is used in two distinct senses. In its earlier signification it is applied to the <hi rend="italic">Chroniclers</hi>, the earliest historians and prose writers, predecessors and contemporaries of Herodotus; of whom an account may be found in M&uuml;ller, <hi rend="italic">Hist. Gr. Lit.</hi> c. XVIII, and Mure, <hi rend="italic">Hist. of Gk. Lit.</hi> Bk. IV. ch. 2, 3, Vol. IV, and Dahlmann, <hi rend="italic">Life of Herodotus</hi>, Ch. VI. sect. 2, and foll. In this sense it occurs in Thuc. I 21, upon which Poppo has this note: &ldquo;Aut solutae orationis scriptores universi, aut historici vel etiam <foreign lang="greek">μυθογράφοι</foreign>&rdquo; (this early history was often of a mythical and legendary character), &ldquo;denique orationum panegyricarum auctores hoc ambiguo vocabulo significantur.&rdquo; (The later, and most usual, meaning of the word is here omitted.) As this was for some time the only prose literature in existence, the <foreign lang="greek">λογογράφοι</foreign> might well be contrasted with the poets, so as to signify &lsquo;prose writers&rsquo; in general. And this, according to Ernesti, <hi rend="italic">Lex. Technologiae Graecae</hi> s. v., is the sense that it bears here, <hi rend="italic">Dichter und prosaische Schriftsteller.</hi> Isocrates also, Phil. &sect; 109, has the same contrast, <foreign lang="greek">οὔτε τῶν ποιητῶν οὔτε τῶν λογοποιῶν</foreign>. </p>
						<p>The later and commoner signification, which appears so frequently in the Orators (see examples in Shilleto's note on Dem. de F. L. &sect; 274), dates from the time of Antiphon, who commenced the practice, which <pb n="137"/> became common, and was pursued for instance by Isocrates and Demosthenes, of <hi rend="italic">writing speeches</hi>, for which he received remuneration, for the use of parties in the law-courts. Public feeling at Athens was very much against this supposed prostitution of a man's talents and special knowledge (which may be compared with Plato's horror, expressed in the Phaedrus, of making a trade of teaching), and <foreign lang="greek">λογογράφος</foreign> became a term of reproach. Perhaps the earliest example of this application is the passage of the Phaedrus, 257 C, where Lysias is said to have been taunted with it by a political opponent, <foreign lang="greek">διὰ πάσης τῆς λοιδορίας ἐκάλει λογογράφον</foreign>. Aeschines applied it very freely to his rival Demosthenes. On this import of the word Gaisford (ad hunc locum) quotes Schol. Plat. p. 63, <foreign lang="greek">λογογράφους ἐκάλουν οἱ παλαιοὶ τοὺς ἐπὶ μισθῷ λόγους γράφοντας, καὶ πιπράσκοντας αὐτοὺς εἰς δικαστήρια· ῥήτορας δὲ τοὺς δἰ ἑαυτῶν λέγοντας</foreign>. </p>
						<p>But besides this special sense, <foreign lang="greek">λογογραφία</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">λογογράφος</foreign> are said of speech-writing and speech-writers in general (so Pl. Phaedr. 257 E, 258 B), and especially of panegyrical speeches, like those of Isocrates, and of speeches written to be read in the closet, and not orally delivered in the law-court or public assembly: and as this is the most appropriate to the present passage of Aristotle, who is speaking of <hi rend="italic">eulogies</hi> in poetry and prose; and is likewise the sense in which it is used in two other passages of the Rhetoric, III 7. 7, 12.2, I have little doubt that it is to be so understood here. Hermogenes <foreign lang="greek">περὶ ἰδεῶν, β</foreign>, chap. 10, <foreign lang="greek">περὶ τοῦ πολιτικοῦ λόγου</foreign>, <hi rend="italic">Rhetores Graeci</hi>, Vol. II. p. 405, 6, and again chap. 12, <foreign lang="greek">περὶ τοῦ ἁπλῶς πανηγυρικοῦ</foreign>, ib. p. 417, in treating of the <foreign lang="greek">πανηγυρικὸς λόγος</foreign>, the name by which he designates Aristotle's <foreign lang="greek">ἐπιδεικτικὸν γένος</foreign>, seems to divide all literature into three branches, poetry, spoken and written speeches; distinguishing <foreign lang="greek">ῥήτορες</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">λογογράφοι</foreign>, and both of them from <foreign lang="greek">ποιηταί; ἄριστος οὖν κατὰ πάντων λόγων εἴδη καὶ ποιητῶν ἁπάντων καὶ ῥητόρων καὶ λογογράφων Ὅμηρος</foreign> (p. 406, 9, and elsewhere). And (in the second passage above referred to) he includes <foreign lang="greek">ἱστορία</foreign> under the general head of <foreign lang="greek">λογογραφία, οὐδὲ μὴν ἡ λογογραφία ἀλλὰ καὶ ἡ ἱστορία</foreign>, p. 417, and still more expressly <foreign lang="greek">ἱστορίας τε καὶ τῆς ἄλλης λογογραφίας</foreign>, p. 418. Rhetoric, when treated as the art of <hi rend="italic">composition</hi>, <foreign lang="greek">λέξις</foreign>, may no doubt be considered to embrace all <hi rend="italic">prose literature</hi>, which will so fall into two divisions (1) public and forensic speeches, orally delivered, and (2) all written compositions. [&ldquo;The relation between ancient oratory and ancient prose, philosophical, historical or literary, is necessarily of the closest kind.&rdquo; Jebb's <hi rend="italic">Attic Orators</hi> I. p. lxxi.] In Rhet. III 12. 2, the written style, <foreign lang="greek">λέξις γραφική</foreign>, is opposed to the <foreign lang="greek">ἀγωνιστική</foreign>, which has to be employed in actual encounter, spoken and acted, not (necessarily) written; and the <foreign lang="greek">συμβουλευτική</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">δικανική</foreign> to the <foreign lang="greek">ἐπιδεικτική</foreign>. The art of composition therefore, and prose composition in general, may properly be referred to this third branch of Rhetoric, the declamatory or panegyrical, as Hermogenes expressly, and Aristotle tacitly, do refer it: and so <foreign lang="greek">λογογράφος</foreign> may mean either a speech<hi rend="italic">writer</hi> (as opposed to <foreign lang="greek">ῥήτωρ</foreign>), or a writer of <hi rend="italic">prose</hi> (as opposed to poetry). </p>
						<p>&lsquo;The opposites of all these (the foregoing classes of persons) are objects of contempt: for contempt is the opposite of emulation, and the notion of the one to the notion of the other&rsquo; (the substantive in <foreign lang="greek">-ις</foreign> denotes the <hi rend="italic">process</hi>, or operation of the feeling; the infin. with <foreign lang="greek">τό</foreign> the <hi rend="italic">abstract conception</hi> of it). &lsquo;And those who are so constituted as to emulate others, <pb n="138"/> or <hi rend="italic">themselves</hi> to be the objects of emulation, must necessarily be inclined to feel contempt for all such persons&mdash;and on such occasions (an unnecessary parenthetical <hi rend="italic">note</hi>, which interrupts the construction)&mdash;as lie under the defects and disadvantages opposite to the good things which are the objects of emulation. Hence contempt is often felt for the fortunate, when their luck comes to them without those good things which are really valuable (i.e. which depend in some degree upon merit for their acquisition)&rsquo;. </p>
						<p>&lsquo;Here ends the account of the means (<hi rend="italic">lit.</hi> channels, <hi rend="italic">media</hi>) by which the several emotions are engendered and dissolved, (furnishing topics or premisses) from which the arguments (modes of persuasion) that belong to them may be derived&rsquo;. </p>
						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">διαλύεται</lemma>] is here applied to the dissolution, breaking up, and so bringing to an end, of the <foreign lang="greek">πάθη</foreign> themselves. In a former passage on a similar subject, c. 4 &sect; 32, it seems rather to have its logical sense of breaking up, or refuting an argument. </p>

The import of these chapters, and their connexion with the main subject of the entire work, which explains and justifies their position here, has been already treated in the Introduction, pp. 110&mdash;112, to which the reader is referred. The study of these &lsquo;characters&rsquo; will enable the speaker to accommodate his language and arguments to their several tastes and dispositions. </p>
					<p>The four stages of human life, as described by Horace, Epist. ad Pis. 156 seq., have much more in common with Shakespeare's &lsquo;seven ages&rsquo;, (<hi rend="italic">As you like it</hi>, Act II. sc. 7 [lines 143&mdash;166],) than with Aristotle's analysis. Horace writes with a view to the use of the <hi rend="italic">poet</hi>, and describes them as they should appear in the drama or the Epic poem: his cha<pb n="139"/> racters are the <hi rend="italic">dramatic characters</hi>: Aristotle writing for the rhetorician applies his analysis to the purposes of <hi rend="italic">argument;</hi> reserving the dramatic expression of character for the third book, where it naturally falls under the treatment of style and expression. Horace's object appears in the lines, <hi rend="italic">Ne forte seniles mandentur iuveni partes pueroque viriles, semper in adiunctis aevoque morabimur aptis</hi> [176]. </p>
					<p>Bacon's <hi rend="italic">Essay</hi>, Of Youth and Age [XLII], is too well known to need more than a mere reference. Two such observers as Aristotle and Bacon must of course agree in the general outline of the two contrasted characters; but Bacon's is a brief sketch, presenting the leading features of both more particularly as they exhibit themselves in the conduct and management of business, and in public life: Aristotle fills in the details of the picture in a much more complete and comprehensive analysis. </p>
					<p>Plutarch, in the treatise <hi rend="italic">de virtute morali</hi>, c. XI, discussing the moral constitution of the human subject, illustrates his material theory of the origin of the <foreign lang="greek">πάθη</foreign> by reference to the characters of the young and old, which he thus describes; <foreign lang="greek">διὸ νέοι μὲν καὶ ὀξεῖς καὶ ἰταμοὶ</foreign> (headlong, hasty, precipitate,) <foreign lang="greek">περί τε τὰς ὀρέξεις διάπυροι καὶ οἰστρώδεις αἵματος πλήθει καὶ θερμότητι· τῶν δὲ πρεσβυτῶν ἡ πρὸς τὸ ἧπαρ ἀρχὴ τοῦ ἐπιθυμητικοῦ κατασβέννυται, καὶ γίνεται μικρὰ καὶ ἀσθενής· ἰσχύει δὲ μᾶλλον ὁ λόγος τοῦ παθητικοῦ τῷ σώματι συναπομαραινομένου</foreign>. Compare with this Rhet. II 12. 8, <foreign lang="greek">ὥσπερ γὰρ οἱ οἰνώμενοι, οὕτω διάθερμοί εἰσιν οἱ νέοι ὑπὸ τῆς φύσεως</foreign>: and 13. 7, <foreign lang="greek">οἱ πρεσβύτεροι ἐναντίως διάκεινται τοῖς νέοις· κατεψυγμένοι γάρ εἰσιν, οἱ δὲ θερμοί. ὥστε προωδοποίηκε τὸ γῆρας τῇ δειλία·ͅ καὶ γὰρ ὁ φόβος κατάψυξίς τίς ἐστι</foreign>. The curious correspondence of the metaphors in the two authors' description of the hot impetuosity of the one and the cold phlegmatic temper of the other, is accounted for by similarity of theory as to the origin of the <foreign lang="greek">πάθη</foreign>. With both the explanation is physiological, and in the spirit of modern inquiries in the same department. Aristotle's views may be gathered from the de Anima I 1, 403 <hi rend="italic">a</hi> 3, seq. He there describes them as inseparable from the body and its matter and functions; with the possible exception of <foreign lang="greek">τὸ νοεῖν</foreign> &lsquo;thought and intelligence&rsquo;, which is there included with the <foreign lang="greek">πάθη</foreign> as a property of &lsquo;life&rsquo;; and they are ranked with sensation in general: <foreign lang="greek">φαίνεται δὲ τῶν μὲν πλείστων</foreign>&mdash;the independent existence of the intellect, or part of it, being left an open question&mdash;<foreign lang="greek">οὐθὲν ἄνευ τοῦ σώματος πάσχειν οὐδὲ ποιεῖν, οἷον ὀργίζεσθαι, θαῤῥεῖν, ἐπιθυμεῖν, ὅλως αἰσθάνεσθαι</foreign>. See further, ib. line 16: and ib. line 31, a &lsquo;physical&rsquo; definition of anger (which he seems to accept as correct as far as it goes) is given, <foreign lang="greek">ζέσις τοῦ περὶ καρδίαν αἵματος καὶ θερμοῦ</foreign>: this is the definition of the <foreign lang="greek">ὕλη</foreign> of the <foreign lang="greek">πάθος</foreign>. Eth. N. IV 15, 1128 <hi rend="italic">b</hi> 14, <foreign lang="greek">σωματικὰ δὴ φαίνεταί πως εἶναι ἀμφότερα</foreign> (<foreign lang="greek">αἰδῶ καὶ νέμεσιν</foreign>) <foreign lang="greek">ὅπερ δοκεῖ πάθους μᾶλλον ἢ ἕξεως εἶναι</foreign>. Near the end of the 12th chapter Plutarch further assigns as the <foreign lang="greek">πάθη τῶν νέων, αἰσχύνη</foreign> (comp. Eth. N. IV 15, 1128 <hi rend="italic">b</hi> 16 seq.), <foreign lang="greek">ἐπιθυμία</foreign> (Aristotle, <foreign lang="greek">ἐπιθυμητικοί</foreign>, c. 12. 3), <foreign lang="greek">μετάνοια</foreign> (Ar. <foreign lang="greek">εὐμετάβολαι</foreign>, c. 12. 4), <foreign lang="greek">ἡδονή, λύπη</foreign> (meaning of course that they are excessively susceptible of these two feelings), <foreign lang="greek">φιλοτιμία</foreign>. (Ar. ib. &sect; 6.) </p>
					<p>Against Spengel's view of these <foreign lang="greek">ἤθη</foreign>&mdash;viz. that they are the analysis of the <foreign lang="greek">ἦθος</foreign> proper, <foreign lang="greek">ἐν τῷ λέγοντι</foreign>, taken by Aristotle out of the order of treatment, which he had originally laid down for the three great divi<pb n="140"/> sions of rhetorical proof, <foreign lang="greek">πίστεις, ἦθος, πάθος</foreign>; and placed after, instead of before, the <foreign lang="greek">πάθη</foreign>&mdash;I will here add to what I have already said in the Introd. p. 112 (and p. 110 on the real difference between the two kinds of <foreign lang="greek">ἦθος</foreign> described in II 1 and here), that, whereas in II 1 reference is made for details to the analysis of the virtues in I 9, the <hi rend="italic">political</hi> characters of I 8, and the characters of the three ages and conditions of life, are not noticed at all; and for the best of reasons; because they in fact belong to a different class of <foreign lang="greek">ἦθος</foreign>; the object of the first, <foreign lang="greek">ἦθος</foreign> proper, being to impress the audience favourably as to your own character and good intentions; that of the second to adapt your tone, sentiments and language, to the tastes and feelings of certain special classes whom you may have to address; you study their &lsquo;characters&rsquo; for the purpose of introducing into your speech what you know will be acceptable to each of them. And precisely the same thing may be said of the <hi rend="italic">political</hi> characters. </p>

						<p>&lsquo;The varieties of men's characters in respect of their instinctive feelings and developed states and of their several ages and fortunes (conditions of life), let us next proceed to describe&rsquo;. &sect; 2. &lsquo;By feelings or emotions I mean anger, desire, and such like of which we have spoken before (II 2&mdash;11), and by settled states, virtues and vices: these too have been discussed before, as well as the objects of individual choice, and of individual action (what sort of things they are inclined to do, or capable of doing, <foreign lang="greek">πρακτικοί</foreign>)&rsquo;. The second reference is to I 9, and probably also to I 5 and 6, on good absolute and comparative, as the object of human aspiration. </p>

						<p>Vater raises a difficulty about the connexion of the above passage with the concluding sentence of the last chapter, which he says he cannot understand. &ldquo;How could Aristotle after stating that he had concluded the description of the <foreign lang="greek">πάθη</foreign> immediately add, as though nothing had been said about them, <hi rend="italic">nunc autem qui mores aut animorum motus &mdash;explicemus</hi>&rdquo;<hi rend="italic">?</hi> My answer is that he does <hi rend="italic">not</hi> say so: the two sentences have reference to two totally different things: at the end of c. 11, he tells us that he has now finished the analysis of the <foreign lang="greek">πάθη</foreign>, and shews by the analysis how they can be applied to the purposes of the rhetorician, how to excite and allay them. What he says at the opening of c. 12, is that he is now going to treat of the application of these <foreign lang="greek">πάθη</foreign> and the <foreign lang="greek">ἕξεις</foreign> which grow out of them to the characters of certain ages and conditions of life. The Latin words quoted are a mere mistranslation: the <foreign lang="greek">κατά</foreign> is overlooked, and the sentence rendered as if it were <foreign lang="greek">τὰ δὲ ἤθη καὶ τὰ πάθη ...διέλθωμεν</foreign>. Vater accordingly on this ground, and also on that of the passage of Quintilian (immediately to be noticed), supposes that something is lost here. </p>
						<p>The passage of Quintilian, V 10. 17, presents a <hi rend="italic">real</hi> difficulty. In referring to Aristotle <hi rend="italic">in secundo de Arte Rhetorica libro</hi>&mdash;which can only <pb n="141"/> mean this place&mdash;he adds to what we actually find in Aristotle several other &lsquo;characters&rsquo; of which no trace is now to be found in his text, &ldquo;<hi rend="italic">ut</hi> divitias <hi rend="italic">quid sequatur, aut</hi> ambitum, <hi rend="italic">aut</hi> superstitionem; <hi rend="italic">quid boni probent, quid mali petant, quid</hi> milites, <hi rend="italic">quid rustici; quo quaeque modo res vitari vel appeti soleat.</hi>&rdquo; Both Victorius (Comm. ad II 17. 6, p. 358, ed. 1548), and Spalding (ad loc. Quint.), attribute the discrepancy to a lapse of memory on Quintilian's part, who was here quoting without book. The former, in a sarcastic note, thinks that it is much more probable to suppose that Quintilian, without referring to the text of his author, added <hi rend="italic">de suo</hi> what he thought <hi rend="italic">ought</hi> to be there, than that anything has been lost in a book which presents no trace of any hiatus. To which Spalding adds, &ldquo;non uno quidem loco vidimus videbimusque Quintilianum memoriae vitio e libris afferentem, quae in iis non plane eadem legerentur. Cf. IV 2. 132.&rdquo; In this explanation I think we must acquiesce. Spengel also, in his tract <hi rend="italic">&uuml;ber die Rhet. des Ar.</hi> (Trans. Bav. Acad. 1851) p. 43, attributes this want of coincidence to a &lsquo;mistake&rsquo; of Quintilian. </p>

						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ἁψίκορος</lemma>. As this word is not explained nor sufficiently illustrated in the Lexicons, it will be well to supply the deficiency by a few examples. This appears to be its earliest appearance in the extant Greek literature. It does not become at all common till Plutarch's time. Hesychius and Suidas supply the derivation. <foreign lang="greek">ἁψίκορον· ἄπλησμον. ἢ ἅμα τῷ ἅψασθαι κορεννύμενον ταχέως. ἁψίκορος· καυματινός</foreign> (<foreign lang="greek">καματηρός</foreign>, Salmasius), <foreign lang="greek">ταχέως ὀλιγωρῶν, καὶ κόρον λαμβάνων. ἁψικόρως· εὐμεταβλήτως</foreign> (Hesychius s. v.). <foreign lang="greek">ἁψίκορος· εὐμετάβλητος· ἢ ὁ ταχέως καὶ ἅμα τῷ ἅψασθαι κορεννύμενος. διά τε τὴν φυσικὴν τῶν Νομάδων ἁψικορίαν</foreign>&rdquo; (fickleness) <foreign lang="greek">κ.τ.λ.</foreign> (Polyb. XIV 1. 4; the quotation in Suidas is inexact), <foreign lang="greek">καὶ αὖθις</foreign> (M. Anton. I 16, Bekker ad loc.) &ldquo;<foreign lang="greek">συντηρητικὸν δεῖ εἶναι πρὸς τοὺς φίλους καὶ μηδαμοῦ ἁψίκορον</foreign>&rdquo; (Suidas, s. v.). Thus the primary meaning of the word is, <hi rend="italic">one that is satiated by a mere touch</hi>, <foreign lang="greek">ἅψει κεκορεσμένος, κορεσθείς</foreign>, easily satisfied with anything, soon tired of it; fickle, changeable, fastidious; <hi rend="italic">fastidiosus, ad mutationem proclivis</hi> (Ast's <hi rend="italic">Lex.

Until we know what the saying was&mdash;<hi rend="italic">dictum hoc Pittaci intercidit</hi>, says Buhle&mdash;we cannot decide whether <foreign lang="greek">εἰς</foreign> is to be interpreted &lsquo;against&rsquo; Amphiaraus or merely applied or addressed &lsquo;to&rsquo; him; [perhaps simply &lsquo;on&rsquo;; with <foreign lang="greek">ἀπόφθεγμα εἰς Ἀμφιάραον</foreign>, compare in this sense Pindar, Ol.

III 83, <foreign lang="greek">καὶ τὸ εὔηθες, οὗ τὸ γενναῖον πλεῖστον μετέχει, καταγελασθὲν ἠφανίσθη</foreign>, &lsquo;simplicity, the chiefest ingredient of a noble temper, was laughed to scorn and disappeared&rsquo;; namely, in that degeneration of character, and consequent perversion of language, which are ascribed by the author to the factious quarrels then prevailing in Greece. </p>

And in Demosth. c. Timocr. 717. 2, <foreign lang="greek">τῆς ὑμετέρας εὐηθείας</foreign> certainly bears the same sense as Aristotle gives to the word here. But in its ordinary application&mdash;even in Herodotus and the tragedians; in Plato, with whom it is very frequent, almost invariably&mdash; &lsquo;simplicity&rsquo; has degenerated into silliness or absurdity, by that process of deterioration, common in language, which Trench, <hi rend="italic">Study of Words</hi>, Lect.

						<p>&lsquo;And they exceed the due measure in self-love, this again (as well as illiberality and cowardice) being a kind of little-mindedness&rsquo; (which is characteristic of them, <hi rend="italic">supra</hi> &sect; 5). The connexion of <foreign lang="greek">μικροψυχία</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">φιλαυτία</foreign> [a word used in late Greek only] seems to be this: Little-mindedness (Eth. N. IV 9, init.) is the undervaluing of oneself, and one's own advantages. This narrows and cramps the mind, which is consequently incapable of lofty aims and aspirations. A form of this is selfishness, or self-love, which is thus described, Eth.

						<p>&lsquo;Their rule in life is profit, not honour, more than it ought to be, which arises from their selfishness: for profit, self-interest, is a man's <hi rend="italic">own</hi> good, whereas honour (or the right) is good absolutely&rsquo;. Orelli quotes this, and <foreign lang="greek">ἀλλὰ κατὰ τὸ κέρδος</foreign>, in illustration of Horace's <hi rend="italic">quaerit et inventis miser abstinet et timet uti</hi>, A. P. 170.

						<p>On <foreign lang="greek">τὸ καλόν</foreign> in its two aspects, see I 7. 24, and I 9. 3, and notes. We are here presented with the two opposing views of good, the ideal and practical. The ideal form represents good as the fair and right, the aim and end of our hopes and aspirations, and the rule of life, in the shape (it may be) of honour or glory (<hi rend="italic">la Gloire</hi>), or some immaterial, high and noble object, apart from all considerations of self, and one's own interest. The practical view of good regards it as something useful and serviceable for the uses and purposes of life, and for one's own interest and advancement; it is <foreign lang="greek">τὸ χρήσιμον</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">τὸ ξυμφέρον</foreign>, the useful and profitable.

						<p>&lsquo;And, speaking in general terms, all the advantages (good qualities, elements of good character) that youth and old age have divided between them (=<foreign lang="greek">ἔχει διῃρημένα</foreign>), both of these the others enjoy; and whereinsoever (the two first) are excessive or defective, in these (they observe, <hi rend="italic">subaudi</hi> <foreign lang="greek">οἱ ἀκμάζοντες ἔχουσιν</foreign>) a due moderation (or mean) and a fitness or propriety of conduct&rsquo;. </p>
						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ὅσα διῄρηται ἡ νεότης καὶ τὸ γῆρας</lemma>] I think <foreign lang="greek">διαιρεῖσθαι</foreign> must be here middle, said of those who divide amongst themselves, have <hi rend="italic">shares</hi> in any joint work or possession. Thuc. VII 19, <foreign lang="greek">διελόμενοι τὸ ἔργον</foreign>. An objection might be taken to this, that <foreign lang="greek">διῄρηται</foreign> is singular and not plural, and <pb n="160"/> that no one can share a thing with himself. But although the verb is singular in form, being connected grammatically with <foreign lang="greek">νεότης</foreign> alone, <hi rend="italic">which stands next to it</hi>, yet it is evident that <foreign lang="greek">γῆρας</foreign> is meant to be included in the distribution as well as the other. It is accordingly equivalent to <foreign lang="greek">διῃρημένα ἔχουσιν</foreign>. I think it cannot be passive; the analogy of <foreign lang="greek">πιστεύεσθαι τι</foreign> &lsquo;to be trusted with something&rsquo;, <foreign lang="greek">ἐπιτετράφθαι τι</foreign>, and the like, cannot be applied to this case. </p>
						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">τὸ μέτριον</lemma>] is Plato's <hi rend="italic">summum bonum</hi>, the highest in the scale of goods, in the Philebus; also the Horatian <hi rend="italic">aurea mediocritas:</hi> it may also stand for the Aristotelian <foreign lang="greek">μέσον</foreign>, which at all events is the sense in which it is employed here. </p>
						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">τὸ ἅρμοττον</lemma>] that which <hi rend="italic">fits</hi>, the fitting; derived by metaphor from the carpenter's, joiner's and builder's trades; is nearly equivalent to <foreign lang="greek">τὸ πρέπον</foreign>, and like it refers us to the <hi rend="italic">fitness of things</hi>, as a standard of good, to a harmonious organisation or order of the universe, a system physical or moral which has all its parts dove-tailed, as it were, together, arranged in due order and subordination, carefully and exactly fitted together; Cicero's <hi rend="italic">apta compositio</hi> (<hi rend="italic">membrorum</hi>, of the human figure [de officiis I 28. 98]). </p>

						<p>&lsquo;The body is in its prime from 30 to 35 (years of age), the soul (i.e. the intellectual and moral faculties) about nine and forty&rsquo; (50 minus one: <foreign lang="greek">δεῖν</foreign> is <foreign lang="greek">δέον</foreign>, <hi rend="italic">wanting</hi> 50 much). </p>
						<p>Two of the numbers here mentioned are multiples of seven. The stages of life are determined by a septenary theory, the earliest record of which is an elegiac fragment of doubtful genuineness (Porson), attributed to Solon (ap. Clemen. Alexandr. <hi rend="italic">Strom.</hi>, Bergk, <hi rend="italic">Lyr. Gr.</hi> p. 332 [346, ed. 2], Sol. Fragm. 25), in which the seventy years allotted to human life, and its successive stages of growth, development and decay, are divided into ten periods of seven years each. The dates here given by Aristotle for the prime of body and mind, agree tolerably well with the verses of the fragment. <foreign lang="greek">τῇ δὲ τετάρτῃ πᾶς τις ἐν ἑβδομάδι μέγ’  ἄριστος ἰσχύν ἥν τ̓ ἄνδρες σήματ̓ ἔχους̓ ἀρετῆς</foreign>. The fifth septenary is the marriageable age. In the seventh the intellect and powers of speech have reached their prime. <foreign lang="greek">ἑπτὰ δὲ</foreign> (49) <foreign lang="greek">νοῦν καὶ γλῶσσαν ἐν ἑβδομάσιν μέγ’  ἄριστος κ.τ.λ.</foreign> </p>
						<p>The same theory, whether derived from Solon or not, which seems to have been generally current, reappears in Polit. IV (VII) 16, 1335 <hi rend="italic">b</hi> 32, <foreign lang="greek">κατὰ τὴν τῆς διανοίας ἀκμήν· αὕτη δ’  ἐστὶν ἐν τοῖς πλείστοις ἥνπερ τῶν ποιητῶν τινὲς εἰρήκασιν οἱ μετροῦντες ταῖς ἑβδομάσι τὴν ἡλικίαν, περὶ τὸν χρόνον τὸν τῶν πεντήκοντα ἐτῶν</foreign> (i.e. 7 x 7 = 49): and again Polit. ib. c. 17, 1336 <hi rend="italic">b</hi> 37, <foreign lang="greek">δύο δ’  εἰσὶν ἡλικίαι πρὸς ἃς ἀναγκαῖον διῃρῆσθαι τὴν παιδείαν, μετὰ τὴν ἀπὸ τῶν ἑπτὰ μεχρὶ ἥβης καὶ πάλιν μετὰ τὴν ἀφ̓ ἥβης μεχρὶ τῶν ἑνὸς καὶ εἴκοσιν ἐτῶν. οἱ γὰρ ταῖς ἑβδομάσιν διαιροῦντες τὰς ἡλικίας ὡς ἐπὶ τὸ πολὺ λέγουσιν οὐ</foreign> <pb n="161"/> <foreign lang="greek">καλῶς</foreign> (leg. <foreign lang="greek">κακῶς</foreign>, Spengel), <foreign lang="greek">δεῖ δὲ τῇ διαιρέσει τῆς φύσεως ἐπακολουθεῖν</foreign>. Nevertheless the theory is departed from in assigning the proper age of marriage in the two sexes; ib. c. 16, 1335 <hi rend="italic">a</hi> 28, the woman is to marry at 18, the man at 37 &lsquo;or thereabouts&rsquo;; neither of them divisible by seven; <foreign lang="greek">ἐν τοσούτῳ γὰρ ἀκμάζουσι τε τοῖς σώμασι σύζευξις ἔσται κ.τ.λ.</foreign> And in line 35, the term of human life is again fixed at 70 years. So the Psalmist [xc. 10], &ldquo;The days of our years are threescore years and ten.&rdquo; </p>
						<p>And to the same theory (the number seven, marking a crisis, or stage of growth, in the life of an animal,) reference is frequently made, in the Hist. Anim., as VII 1. 2, 16, 18, c. 12. 2, and elsewhere: from all which it may be concluded that Aristotle was a believer in it. Plato, Rep. V 460 E, fixes the prime of life in a woman at the age of 20, in a man at 30: in Legg. IV 721 A, and in three other places, the age of marriage is fixed from 30 to 35, though in one of them (VI 772 E) 25 is also named. Compare on this subject Hes. Opp. et D. 695 seq. Xenoph. de Rep. Lac. I 6, (Stallbaum's note on Plato l c). </p>
						<p>But the theory of the virtues of the number seven was carried to a far greater extent, as may be seen in I 6 of Macrobius' Commentary on Cicero's <hi rend="italic">Somnium Scipionis</hi>, of which the sum is given in a quotation from the <hi rend="italic">Somnium Scipionis:&mdash;Cicero de septenario dicit, Qui numerus rerum omnium fere nodus est.</hi> Everything in nature is determined by the number seven. Near the end of the chapter, we are told, in conformity with Aristotle's statement, <hi rend="italic">Notandum vero quod, cum numerus se multiplicat</hi> (at the age of 49, 7 x 7), <hi rend="italic">facit aetatem quae proprie perfecta et habetur et dicitur: adeo ut illius aetatis homo, utpote qui perfectionem et attigerit iam, et necdum praeterierit, et consilio aptus sit, nec ab exercitio virium alienus habeatur.</hi> This is the prime of mind and body together. <hi rend="italic">Quinta</hi> (hebdomas) <hi rend="italic">omne virium</hi> (strength and powers of body alone), <hi rend="italic">quanta esse unicuique, possunt, complet augmentum.</hi> All this came no doubt originally from the Pythagoreans; as may be inferred from Arist. Met. N 6, 1093 <hi rend="italic">a</hi> 13, where this number seven, is said to be assigned by them as the <hi rend="italic">cause</hi> of everything that happened to have this number of members; <hi rend="italic">seven</hi> vowels, <hi rend="italic">seven</hi> chords or harmonies, <hi rend="italic">seven</hi> Pleiads; animals shed their teeth in <hi rend="italic">seven</hi> years&mdash;yes, says Ar., <hi rend="italic">some</hi> do, but some don't&mdash;and <hi rend="italic">seven</hi> champions against Thebes. And from this and similar considerations they inferred some mysterious virtue in the number; and identified it with <foreign lang="greek">νοῦς</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">καιρός</foreign>. (Ritter and Preller, <hi rend="italic">Hist. Phil.</hi> c. 2, Pythag. &sect; 102, note <hi rend="italic">a.</hi>) </p>
						<p>&lsquo;So for youth and age and prime of life, the kind of characters, that is to say, that belong to each, let thus much suffice&rsquo; (to have been said). </p>

						<p>&lsquo;This condition of life is inclined to look down upon even those who resemble, are on a level with, (in condition, wealth, rank, distinction, and so forth,) their own ancestors, because their distinctions, in proportion to the degree of their remoteness, are more distinguished (than those of contemporaries) and are easier to brag of&rsquo; (more readily admit of boastful exaggeration). <hi rend="italic">Distance lends enchantment to the view.</hi> Honours and distinctions shine with a brighter lustre in the remote ages of antiquity, and confer more dignity upon those who by right of inheritance can claim a share in them, than those of the same kind, and equal in all other respects, when acquired by contemporaries&mdash;familiarity breeds in some degree contempt for them&mdash;just as <foreign lang="greek">ἀρχαιοπλουτεῖν</foreign> is a higher claim to consideration than <foreign lang="greek">νεοπλουτεῖν</foreign>, II 9. 9, q. v.

						<p>&lsquo;The term <foreign lang="greek">εὐγενές</foreign> (<hi rend="italic">well-born</hi>, come of a good stock, of noble <hi rend="italic">race</hi>, or <hi rend="italic">descent</hi>) is applied to mark distinction (excellence) of race; <foreign lang="greek">γενναῖος</foreign> (of noble <hi rend="italic">character</hi>) to the maintenance of the normal type of character&rsquo; (keeping up to, not degenerating from, the true family standard). The difference between <foreign lang="greek">εὐγενής</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">γενναῖος</foreign> lies in this; that in the former the <hi rend="italic">race</hi> or <hi rend="italic">descent</hi>, <foreign lang="greek">γένος</foreign>, is <hi rend="italic">directly</hi> expressed as the prominent and leading idea; it indicates that the <foreign lang="greek">εὐγενής</foreign> comes of a good breed, but says nothing of the individual character: in the latter it is the <hi rend="italic">character</hi>, conformable to the excellence of the breed or race, that is put prominently forward. The account here given of <foreign lang="greek">εὐγένεια</foreign> is illustrated by the definition of it in I 5. 5; it denotes in fact the excellences and distinctions of one's ancestors, <hi rend="italic">as distinguished from</hi> one's own. See the passages there collected. In Hist. Anim. I 1, 488 <hi rend="italic">b</hi> 18, these two words are defined and distinguished almost in the same terms; <foreign lang="greek">εὐγενὲς μὲν γάρ ἐστι τὸ ἐξ ἀγαθοῦ γένους, γενναῖον δὲ τὸ μὴ ἐξιστάμενον ἐκ τῆς αὑτοῦ φύσεως</foreign>. Ar. is here characterising the dispositions of animals. Some are <foreign lang="greek">ἐλευθέρια καὶ ἀνδρεῖα καὶ εὐγενῆ οἷον λέων, τὰ δὲ γενναῖα καὶ ἄγρια καὶ ἐπίβουλα, οἷον λύκος·</foreign> from which it appears that <foreign lang="greek">γενναιότης</foreign> is strictly and properly <hi rend="italic">only</hi> the maintenance of a certain type of character, which need not necessarily be a good one: though in ordinary usage it is invariably applied to denote good qualities.

						<p>&lsquo;When clever families degenerate, their characters acquire a tendency to madness, as for instance the descendants of Alcibiades and Dionysius the elder (tyrant of Syracuse), whereas those of a steady (staid, stable) character degenerate into sluggishness or <hi rend="italic">dulness</hi>&rsquo; (of which the stubborn ass is the type; <foreign lang="greek">ὡς δ’  ὅτ̓ ὄνος...ἐβιήσατο παῖδας νωθής, ᾧ δὴ πολλὰ περὶ ῥόπαλ̓ ἀμφὶς ἐάγη</foreign> [Il.

						<p>&lsquo;And at the same time, these affections are natural to them, for many are they who require (the aid, the services) of the wealthy&rsquo;. They have an excuse for being thus affected by their wealth; the numerous claimants upon their bounty elate them with a sense of superiority, and at the same time by their servility give them frequent opportunities of exercising at their expense their ostentation and ill manners.

This same story is alluded to by Plato, Rep. VI 489 C, without naming the author of the saying, who indignantly denies its truth. The Scholiast, in supplying the omission, combines the two different versions of Aristotle and Diog. Laert., and describes it as a dialogue between Socrates and Eubulus. Diog. Laert.

				<div id="b2c18" type="chapter" n="18">

					<p>The following chapter marks a division of the general subject of the work, and a stage or landing-place, from which we look back to what has been already done, and forwards to what still remains to do. The evident intention of the writer is to give a summary statement of the entire plan, and the main division of his system of Rhetoric, contained in the first two books, which comprise all the intellectual part, <foreign lang="greek">τὰ περὶ τὴν διάνοιαν</foreign>, II 26. 5, all that depends on argument; as opposed to the non-essential and ornamental part, style, action, and arrangement, treated in Bk. III. And it may fairly be supposed that it was also his intention to arrange these divisions in the same order as that which he proposed to follow in the actual treatment of the subject. </p>
					<p>But in the text, at any rate of the first half of the chapter, to <foreign lang="greek">ποιητέον</foreign>, this order is not observed; and there is altogether so much irregularity and confusion in the structure of the sentences, and such a mixture of heterogeneous subjects, that it seems tolerably certain that we have not this portion of the chapter in the form in which Aristotle wrote it. First, the long parenthesis about the applicability of the terms <foreign lang="greek">κρίσις</foreign> or decision, and <foreign lang="greek">κρίτης</foreign>, <hi rend="italic">judge</hi> or critic, to all the three branches of Rhetoric, has no natural connexion with the context&mdash;though at the same time it is quite true that the use of the parenthesis, <hi rend="italic">a note</hi> inserted in the <hi rend="italic">text</hi>, is a marked feature of Aristotle's ordinary style: still this would be an exaggeration, or abuse of the peculiarity. Spengel has pointed out (<hi rend="italic">Trans. Bav. Acad.</hi> 1851, p. 35), that the whole of this parenthesis, <foreign lang="greek">ἔστι δέβουλεύονται</foreign> [p. 175, line 2, to p. 176, last line], is nothing but an expansion of a preceding passage, <pb n="172"/> I 1. 2, the same notion being here carried out into detail. But although it is so much out of place that it is hardly conceivable that even Aristotle (whose style is not remarkable for its close connexion&mdash;is in fact often rather rambling and incoherent) should have introduced it here, as part of an enormous protasis of which the apodosis or conclusion relates to something entirely different; yet as it bears all the characteristic marks of the author's style, including the irregularity and the heaping of parenthesis upon parenthesis, though it was most probably not written for this place, there is no reason to doubt that it proceeds from the pen of Aristotle. </p>
					<p>The parenthesis ends at <foreign lang="greek">βουλεύονται</foreign>, and we ought now to resume the interrupted <foreign lang="greek">πρότασις</foreign>. This appears, according to the ordinary punctuation, (with the full stop at <foreign lang="greek">πρότερον</foreign>,) to be carried on as far as <foreign lang="greek">πρότερον</foreign>, the conclusion or apodosis being introduced by <foreign lang="greek">ὥστε</foreign>, as usual. The grammar <foreign lang="greek">ἐπεί...ὥστε</foreign> is no objection to this, since we have already seen (note on II 9. 11) that Aristotle is often guilty of this, and even greater grammatical irregularities. But the sense shews that the passage when thus read cannot be sound. There is no real conclusion; for it by no means follows that, because &lsquo;the employment of all persuasive speeches is directed to a <hi rend="italic">decision</hi> of some kind&rsquo;, and because (second member of protasis) &lsquo;the political characters&rsquo; have been described (in I 8), &lsquo;<hi rend="italic">therefore</hi> it has been determined how and by what means or materials speeches may be invested with an ethical character&rsquo;. In fact it is a complete <hi rend="italic">non-sequitur.</hi> </p>
					<p>Bekker [ed. 3] and Spengel, in order to establish a connexion between protasis and apodosis, put a comma at <foreign lang="greek">πρότερον</foreign>; suppose that the preceding sentence from the beginning of the chapter is left incomplete, without apodosis, at <foreign lang="greek">βουλεύονται</foreign>; and that <foreign lang="greek">ὥστε</foreign> marks the conclusion <hi rend="italic">only</hi> from the clause immediately preceding; the meaning then being, that the description of the &lsquo;political characters&rsquo; in I 8 is a sufficient determination of the modes of imparting an ethical character to the speech. But this cannot be right: for not only is the fact alleged quite insufficient in itself to support the conclusion supposed to be deduced from it, but also the two kinds of characters designated are in fact different; and it could not be argued from the mere description of the characters of I 8, that the <foreign lang="greek">ἦθος ἐν τῷ λέγοντι</foreign> had been sufficiently discussed and determined; which is in fact done&mdash;so far as it is done at all&mdash;in II 1, and not in I 8. </p>
					<p>Other proposed alterations and suggested difficulties in the rest of the chapter may be left for discussion to their place in the Commentary: the meaning and connexion of this part are in general perfectly intelligible, though omission, interpolation, and obscurity or error are alleged against this and that phrase; and the order of the actual contents of the work coincides essentially and in the main with that which is here followed. </p>
					<p>I have now to state the views of two recent critics and commentators upon the whole passage, in its connexion with the order of the several divisions of the entire work. </p>
					<p>Spengel's views upon this subject are to be found in his tract <hi rend="italic">&uuml;ber die Rhetorik des Arist.</hi>, in the <hi rend="italic">Transactions of the Bav. Acad.</hi> 1851, <pb n="173"/> pp. 32&mdash;37; a work which I have already had frequent occasion to refer to. He had previously spoken of the order contemplated and adopted by Aristotle, in the arrangement of the three main divisions of his subject; the analysis of the direct proofs, <foreign lang="greek">πίστεις</foreign>, by logical argument, and the two modes of indirect confirmation of the others, the <foreign lang="greek">ἤθη</foreign>, and the <foreign lang="greek">πάθη</foreign>. The passages which he himself quotes in illustration of the first order in which Aristotle proposes to take them, pp. 25&mdash;27, shew that the order is <foreign lang="greek">πίστεις, ἤθη, πάθη</foreign>: nevertheless Spengel inverts the two last, p. 30 et seq., omitting the actual treatment of the <foreign lang="greek">ἦθος</foreign>, as a <hi rend="italic">subsidiary argument</hi> or mode of persuasion in II 1, the true <foreign lang="greek">ἦθος ἐν τῷ λέγοντι</foreign>; and, as it seems to me, confounding that with a totally different set of characters, which are delineated as an appendix to the <foreign lang="greek">πάθη</foreign>, and consequently <hi rend="italic">after</hi> them in II 12&mdash;17. This I have already pointed out, and explained the real application of the six characters of II 12&mdash;17 to the purposes of Rhetoric, in the Introduction p. 110, foll. and at the commencement of c. 12 in the Commentary. Spengel notices the inconclusive <foreign lang="greek">ὥστε</foreign> in the apodosis, c. 18. 1 (p. 34), apparently assuming that the passage is corrupt, but throws no further light upon the interpretation or means of correcting the section. Next we have, p. 36 foll., an attempt to prove that <foreign lang="greek">τὰ λοιπά</foreign>, in &sect; 5, is to be understood of the treatment of the <foreign lang="greek">πάθος</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">ἦθος</foreign> contained severally in c. 2&mdash;11 and 12&mdash;17 of Bk. II, and that consequently from the words <foreign lang="greek">ὅπως τὰ λοιπὰ προσθέντες ἀποδῶμεν τὴν ἐξ ἀρχῆς πρόθεσιν</foreign> we are to conclude that the order of treatment of the contents of the first two books was as follows; the <foreign lang="greek">εἴδη</foreign>, or <foreign lang="greek">πίστεις ἐξ αὐτοῦ τοῦ λόγου</foreign> (as if the <foreign lang="greek">ἦθος</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">πάθος</foreign> were not equally conveyed <hi rend="italic">by the speech itself</hi>), occupying the first book; next, the four <foreign lang="greek">κοινοὶ τόποι</foreign>, and the second part of the logical <foreign lang="greek">πίστεις</foreign>, II 18&mdash;26; and thirdly, the <foreign lang="greek">πάθος</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">ἦθος</foreign> in the first seventeen chapters of Bk. II, which originally formed the conclusion of that book, though now the order of the two parts is inverted. </p>
					<p>Vahlen, in a paper in the <hi rend="italic">Transactions of the Vienna Acad. of Sciences</hi>, Oct. 1861, pp. 59&mdash;148, has gone at some length into the questions that arise out of this eighteenth chapter, where it is compared with other passages in which Aristotle has indicated the order in which he meant to treat the several divisions of his subject. Op. cit. 121&mdash;132. His principal object in writing, he says, p. 122, is to defend against Brandis' criticisms Spengel's view that the original arrangement of Aristotle in treating the subjects of the second book has been subsequently inverted in the order in which they now stand; Aristotle having intended to complete the survey of the logical department of Rhetoric before he entered upon the <foreign lang="greek">ἤθη</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">πάθη</foreign>. He is of opinion (p. 126) that the analysis of the <foreign lang="greek">κοινοὶ τόποι</foreign> came next (in accordance with the original plan) to the <foreign lang="greek">εἴδη</foreign> of the first book; and consequently that there is a gap at the opening of the second between the conclusion of the <foreign lang="greek">εἴδη</foreign> and the commencement of the <foreign lang="greek">ἤθη</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">πάθη</foreign>; and that as a further consequence, the words in &sect; 2, <foreign lang="greek">ἔτι δ’  ἐξ ὧν ἠθικούσδιώρισται</foreign>, are an interpolation of some editor of Aristotle's work, who introduced them, <hi rend="italic">after the</hi> <foreign lang="greek">κοινοὶ τόποι</foreign> <hi rend="italic">had been transferred to their present place</hi>, as a necessary recognition of what had actually been done. His principal object is in fact to establish what he conceives to be the true order of the several parts of <pb n="174"/> the work; and in doing so he deals, as it seems to me, in the most arbitrary manner with Aristotle's text. He assumes a Redactor, or Editor, who has taken various liberties with the text of his author, and has interpolated various passages, chiefly relating to the <foreign lang="greek">ἤθη</foreign>, to supply what he conceived to be deficient after the order had been changed. How or why the order was changed, neither he nor Spengel gives us any indication; and the supposition of these repeated interpolations has little or no foundation except his own hypothesis of the inseparable connexion of the <foreign lang="greek">εἴδη</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">κοινοὶ τόποι</foreign>: for my own part I cannot find in the passages which he quotes in support of this opinion, or elsewhere in Aristotle's Rhetoric, any statement of a necessary connexion between the two, such as to make it imperative that the <foreign lang="greek">κοινοὶ τόποι</foreign> should be treated immediately after the <foreign lang="greek">εἴδη</foreign>. The order of treatment which we find in the received text appears to be sufficiently natural and regular to defend it&mdash; in default of the strongest evidence to the contrary&mdash;against the suspicion of dislocation and interpolation, though no doubt the order suggested by Vahlen may be, considered in itself, more strictly logical and consecutive. On the connexion of the clauses of the passage now under consideration (c. 18 &sect; 1), and how and why the long inappropriate parenthesis was introduced <hi rend="italic">here</hi>&mdash;which are, after all, the things that most require explanation&mdash;he leaves us as much in the dark as his predecessor Spengel. His interpretation of <foreign lang="greek">τὰ λοιπά</foreign> (which Spengel seems to have misunderstood), and anything else that requires notice, may be left for the notes on the passages to which they belong. </p>
					<p>I have suggested in the Introduction, p. 250, the possibility of the accidental omission of some words or sentences between <foreign lang="greek">εἴρηται πρότερον</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">ὥστε διωρισμένον</foreign>, in order to supply some connexion between protasis and apodosis, and give some significance to the conclusion; but without any great confidence in the success of the attempt to solve the difficulty: to which I am bound to add that it leaves unexplained the introduction of the parenthesis, <foreign lang="greek">ἔστι δέβουλεύονται</foreign>, which, however and whencesoever it may have been introduced, is here most certainly out of place. And I will now proceed to give a summary of the contents of the chapter, as I understand them. </p>
					<p>All speeches which have persuasion for their object are addressed to, or look to, a <hi rend="italic">decision</hi> of some kind. In the two more important branches of Rhetoric, the deliberative and forensic, <foreign lang="greek">ἐν τοῖς πολιτικοῖς ἀγῶσιν</foreign>, the <hi rend="italic">decision</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">judge</hi> may be understood literally: in the third or epideictic branch, the audience is in some sense also a judge, in his capacity of <hi rend="italic">critic</hi>, being called upon to <hi rend="italic">decide</hi> or pass sentence on the merits of the composition. Still it is only in the first two that the term &lsquo;judge&rsquo; can be applied to the hearer in its absolute, or strict and proper sense (<foreign lang="greek">ἁπλῶς κριτής</foreign>). Then, as a second member of the protasis, comes a clause which has the appearance of being a continuation or supplement of something which has been lost&mdash;a reference, namely, to the treatment of the <foreign lang="greek">ἦθος</foreign> in II 1, which might justify the conclusion that follows, that &lsquo;it has now been determined in what way and by what means speeches may be made to assume an ethical character&rsquo;. Still the sentence and its statements remain incomplete: for if, as it appears, Aristotle's intention was to give an enumeration in detail of the main divisions of his Rhetoric <pb n="175"/> in the order in which he had placed them, the omission of the important department of the <foreign lang="greek">πάθη</foreign> would be quite unaccountable, unless indeed&mdash; which I am myself inclined to believe&mdash;he meant to include the <foreign lang="greek">πάθη</foreign> under the general head of <foreign lang="greek">ἠθικοὶ λόγοι</foreign>; which, as the treatment of the <foreign lang="greek">πάθη</foreign> belongs to Ethics, and the effects of the use of them by the speaker are purely ethical, he was fairly entitled to do. At the same time, if this be admitted, the <hi rend="italic">first part</hi> of the protasis with the parenthesis appended has no sufficient connexion with the conclusive <foreign lang="greek">ὥστε</foreign>: nor is it clear why the &lsquo;political characters&rsquo;, which do not come under the <foreign lang="greek">ἦθος</foreign> proper, should be especially singled out as one at least of its representatives: though, if I am right in supposing something to be lost which stood before this clause, it might very likely have contained something which led to the mention of these characters, as one of the varieties of <foreign lang="greek">ἦθος</foreign> which impart an ethical colour to the speech. </p>
					<p>However, let us suppose at least, as we fairly may, that Aristotle's intention, however frustrated by corruption of his manuscript, was to tell us what he had already done from the commencement of the second book, and what he next proposed to do in the remainder of it. He has hitherto been employed (in this book) upon the Ethical branches of the art, by which the character of the speaker himself may be displayed in a favourable light, and the emotions of the audience directed into a channel favourable to the designs of the orator, &sect; 1. </p>
					<p>We now take a fresh start, and from a new protasis, which states that the <foreign lang="greek">εἴδη</foreign>, from which the statesman and public speaker, the pleader, and the declaimer, may derive their premisses and proofs, have been analysed under these three branches of Rhetoric, and also the materials, which may serve for imparting an ethical colour (in two senses, as before) to the speech, have been already despatched and determined, we arrive at the conclusion that it is now time to enter upon the subject of the <foreign lang="greek">κοινοί</foreign> or universal topics&mdash;three in number as they are here classified, the possible and impossible, the past and the future, and amplification or exaggeration and depreciation&mdash;which comes next in order; and is accordingly treated in the following chapter. When this has been settled, we must endeavour to find something to say about <hi rend="italic">enthymemes</hi> in general, arguments which may be applied to all the branches of Rhetoric alike, and <hi rend="italic">examples</hi>, the two great departments of rhetorical reasoning or proof, &lsquo;that by the addition of what still remained to be done&rsquo; (that is, by the completion of the logical division of the subject, by the discussion of enthymemes and examples, c. 20, the enthymeme including the <foreign lang="greek">γνώμη</foreign>, c. 21, the varieties of enthymeme, demonstrative and refutative, c. 22, and specimens of these, c. 23, fallacious enthymemes, c. 24, and the solution of them, c. 25, with an appendix, c. 26), &lsquo;we may fulfil the engagement, the task, which we proposed to ourselves at the outset of this work&rsquo;. </p>

In either case, if you want to persuade or convince any one, as an antagonist real or imaginary, you are looking for a decision or judgment in some sense or other: in the case of the defence of the thesis, the opposing argument or theory, which has to be overcome, seems to stand in the place of the antagonist in a contest of real life, who must be convinced if you are to succeed.

Therefore, either <foreign lang="greek">συμβουλεύοντες</foreign> must be changed into <foreign lang="greek">προτρέποντες</foreign> (printed by an oversight <foreign lang="greek">ἀποτρέποντες</foreign>) or better, <foreign lang="greek">ἢ ἀποτρέποντες</foreign> erased: the course which he has adopted in his recent edition.

						<p>&lsquo;The possibility of anything, in respect of being or coming to be, implies the possibility of the contrary: as, for example, if it be possible for a man to be cured, it is possible for him also to fall ill: for there is the same power, faculty, potentiality, i.e. possibility of affecting a subject, in the two contraries, in so far as they are contrary one to another&rsquo;. </p>
						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ᾗ ἐναντία</lemma>] i.e. solely in respect of their being contraries, and excluding all other considerations. As in the instance given, a man is equally liable to be affected by health and sickness in so far as they are contraries, without regard to any properties or qualities in himself, which may render him more or less liable to one or the other. This is Schrader's explanation. </p>
						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">τἀναντία</lemma>] &lsquo;contraries&rsquo; is one of the four varieties of <foreign lang="greek">ἀντικείμενα</foreign>, &lsquo;opposites&rsquo;. These are (1) <foreign lang="greek">ἀντίφασις</foreign>, &lsquo;contradiction&rsquo; (or contradictories), <foreign lang="greek">κατάφασις</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">ἀπόφασις</foreign>, affirmation and negation, affirmative and negative, to be and not to be, yes and no. (2) <foreign lang="greek">τὰ ἐναντία</foreign>, &lsquo;contraries&rsquo; which are defined as the extreme opposites under the same genus&mdash;good and bad, black and white, long and short, quick and slow, &amp;c.&mdash;which cannot reside in the same subject together. (3) Relative opposites, <foreign lang="greek">τὰ πρός τι</foreign>, as double and half, master and servant, father and son, &amp;c. And (4) opposites of state and privation, <foreign lang="greek">ἕξις</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">στέρησις</foreign>, the possession of something and the privation, absence, want, of it; as sight and blindness. (This last term, however, privation, is properly applied only to cases in which the opposite, possession or state, is <hi rend="italic">natural</hi> to the possessor; in which consequently that which <hi rend="italic">wants</hi> it, is <hi rend="italic">deprived</hi>&mdash;defrauded, as it were&mdash;of something to which it has a natural claim: blindness can only be called a <foreign lang="greek">στέρησις</foreign> when the individual affected by it belongs to a class <pb n="180"/> </p>

Ib. c. 8, 113 <hi rend="italic">b</hi> 15 seq. Ib. E 6. Metaph. <foreign lang="greek">Δ</foreign> 10, 1018 <hi rend="italic">a</hi> 20 seq. (where two more kinds are added, unnecessarily, see Bonitz ad loc.) and I 4, 1055 <hi rend="italic">a</hi> 38, where the usual four are alone mentioned. Cicero, Topic. XI 47&mdash;49, enumerates and illustrates the same four. Of <foreign lang="greek">ἐναντία</foreign> he says, <hi rend="italic">Haec, quae ex eodem genere contraria sunt appellantur adversa. Contrarium</hi> with him is Aristotle's <foreign lang="greek">ἀντικείμενον</foreign>, the <hi rend="italic">genus</hi>, or general notion of <hi rend="italic">opposite.</hi> </p>
						<p>The <hi rend="italic">argument</hi> from contraries, as employed here, is this: the possibility of anything <hi rend="italic">being</hi> or becoming the one, implies that of being or becoming the other; only not both at once: a virtuous man may always become (has the capacity, <foreign lang="greek">δύναμις</foreign>, of becoming) vicious, and the converse; but <foreign lang="greek">ἐνεργείᾳ</foreign>, when the one state is actually present, and <hi rend="italic">realised</hi> in the subject, it excludes the other. This reciprocal possibility in contraries arises from the fact that the two contraries belong to the same <hi rend="italic">genus</hi> or class. Black and white both fall under the <hi rend="italic">genus</hi> colour, of which they are the extremes; they pass from one into the other by insensible gradations of infinite variety, from which we may infer that any surface that admits of colour at all, will admit either of them indifferently apart, but not together; two different colours cannot be shewn on the same surface and at the same time. </p>
					</div3>
					<div3 id="b2c19s2" type="section" n="2">
						<p>Again, likeness or resemblance, <foreign lang="greek">τὸ ὅμοιον</foreign>, between two things suggests or implies a common possibility; if one thing can be done, the probability is that anything else <hi rend="italic">like it</hi> can be done equally. </p>
						<p>This is a variety of the argument from <hi rend="italic">analogy.</hi> We have a tendency, which appears to be natural and instinctive, to infer from any manifest or apparent resemblance between two objects, that is, from certain properties or attributes which they are seen or known to possess in common, the common possession of other properties and attributes, which are not otherwise known to belong to them, whereby we are induced to refer them to the same class. So here, the likeness of two things in certain respects, is thought to imply something different, which is also common to both; a common capacity or possibility. The argument being here applied solely to the use of Rhetoric, the things in question are rather actions and their consequences than facts and objects: if it has been found possible to effect something, to gain some political advantage for instance, in several previous cases, we argue that in the similar, parallel case which is under consideration, the like possibility may be expected. </p>
						<p>This however, though the popular view of the argument from analogy, and the ordinary mode of applying it, is not, strictly speaking, the right application of the term. Analogy, <foreign lang="greek">τὸ ἀνάλογον</foreign>, is arithmetical or geometrical proportion, and represents a similarity, not between objects themselves, but between the relations of them. See Sir W. Hamilton, <hi rend="italic">Lect. on Logic</hi>, Vol. 11. p. 165&mdash;174, Lect. XXXII, and on this point, p. 170. Whately (<hi rend="italic">Rhet.</hi> p. 74, c. 1), &ldquo;Analogy, being a resemblance of ratios, that should strictly be called an argument from analogy, in which the two cases (viz. the one <hi rend="italic">from</hi> which, and the one <hi rend="italic">to</hi> which we argue) are not themselves alike, but stand in a similar <hi rend="italic">relation</hi> to something else; or, in other words, that the common genus that they both fall under, consists <pb n="181"/> in a relation.&rdquo; This he illustrates by two examples of analogical reasoning. One of them is, the inferences that may be drawn as to mental qualities and the changes they undergo, from similar changes (i.e. relations) in the physical constitution&mdash;though of course there can be no direct resemblance between them. Hamilton's illustration of analogy proper is derived directly from a numerical proportion: that of analogy in its popular usage is, &ldquo;This disease corresponds in many symptoms with those we have observed in typhus fevers; it will therefore correspond in all, that is, it is a typhus fever,&rdquo; p. 171. </p>
						<p>Buther's <hi rend="italic">Analogy of Natural and Revealed Religion to the constitution and course of Nature</hi> may be regarded as an analogy of relations between them and God the author of both, in the proper sense of the word, though in his Introduction he twice appears to identify analogy with mere likeness or similarity. </p>
						<p>Lastly, the logical description of Analogy is to be found in Thomson's <hi rend="italic">Law of Thought</hi>, &sect; 121, &lsquo;Syllogism of Analogy&rsquo;, p. 250, seq. The author's definition is, p. 252, &ldquo;the same attributes may be assigned to distinct but similar things, provided they can be shewn to accompany the points of resemblance in the things, and not the points of difference.&rdquo; Or &lsquo;when the resemblance is undoubted, and does not depend on one or two external features&rsquo;), &ldquo;when one thing resembles another in known particulars, it will resemble it also in the unknown.&rdquo; </p>

						<p>&lsquo;The possibility of the <hi rend="italic">beginning</hi> of anything implies also that of the <hi rend="italic">end:</hi> for nothing impossible comes into being or begins to do so, <pb n="182"/> as for example the commensurability of the diameter (with the side of the square) never either begins to, nor actually does, come into being. <hi rend="italic">To begin implies to end</hi>, says Tennyson, <hi rend="italic">Two Voices</hi> [line 339]. In interpreting a rhetorical topic which is to guide men's practice, it is plain that we must keep clear of metaphysics. The beginning and end here have nothing to do with the finite and infinite. Nor is it meant that things that can be begun necessarily admit of being finished: the Tower of Babel, as well as other recorded instances of <hi rend="italic">opera interrupta</hi>, shew that this is not true. And though it may be true of the design or intention, of any attempt, that it always looks forward to an end, immediate or remote, still to the public speaker it is facility and expediency, rather than the mere possibility, of the measure he is recommending, that is likely to be of service in carrying his point. All that is really meant is, that if you want to know whether the end of any course of action, plan, scheme, or indeed of anything&mdash;is possible, you must look to the begining: beginning implies end: if it can be begun, it can also be brought to an end: nothing that is known to be impossible, like squaring the circle, can ever have a beginning, or be brought into being. Schrader exemplifies it by, <hi rend="italic">Mithridates coepit vinci, ergo et debellari poterit.</hi> Proverbs and passages on the importance of <foreign lang="greek">ἀρχή</foreign> are cited in the note on I 7. 11. </p>
						<p>The incommensurability of the diameter with the side of the square, or, which is the same thing, the impossibility of squaring the circle, is Aristotle's stock illustration of <hi rend="italic">the impossible:</hi> see examples in Bonitz ad Metaph. A 2, 983 <hi rend="italic">a</hi> 16. Euclid, Bk. X. Probl. ult. Trendelenburg, on de Anima III 6. 1, p. 500, explains this: the diameter of a square is represented by the root of 2, which is irrational, and therefore incommensurable  with the side. He also observes that Aristotle cannot refer to the squaring of the circle; a question which was still in doubt in the time of Archimedes could not be assumed by Aristotle as an example of impossibility. The illustration, which passed into a proverb, <foreign lang="greek">ἐκ διαμέτρου ἀντικεῖσθαι</foreign>, is confined to the side and diameter of the parallelogram. See also Waitz on Anal. Pr. 41 <hi rend="italic">a</hi> 26. </p>
						<p>&lsquo;And when the end is possible, so also is the beginning, because everything takes its origin, is generated, from a beginning&rsquo;. The end implies the beginning: everything that comes into being or is produced &mdash;everything therefore with which the orator has to deal in his sphere of practical life&mdash;has a beginning. Since the beginning is implied in the end, it is clear that if the end be attainable or possible, so likewise must the beginning be. </p>

						<p>&lsquo;And if it is possible for the latter, the posterior, the subsequent, of two things, either in substance and essence, or generation, to be brought into being, then also the prior, the antecedent; for instance, if a man <pb n="183"/> can be generated, then a child; for <hi rend="italic">that</hi> (the child) is prior in generation (every man must have been first a boy; this is <foreign lang="greek">ἐν γενέσει</foreign>, in the order of growth, in the succession of the natural series of generation or propagation): and if a child, then a man; because this (the child, <foreign lang="greek">ἐκείνη</foreign> being made to agree with <foreign lang="greek">ἀρχή</foreign> instead of <foreign lang="greek">παῖς</foreign>,) is a beginning or origin&rsquo;. This latter example is by the rule that every end necessarily implies a beginning; a child stands in the relation to mature man of beginning to end: and therefore every grown man must have passed through the period of childhood; which is also reducible to the other rule, that the possibility of subsequent implies that of antecedent, of which the preceding example is an illustration. </p>
						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">τὸ ὕστερον, τὸ πρότερον</lemma>] The two principal passages on the various senses in which <foreign lang="greek">πρότερον</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">ὕστερον</foreign>, before and after, earlier and later, antecedent and subsequent, prior and posterior, can be applied, are Categ. c. 12, in which five varieties are distinguished, and Met. <foreign lang="greek">Δ</foreign> 11, in which there are four. On the former passage Waitz says in his Comm. p. 316, &ldquo;non premendam esse divisionem quam nostro loco tradidit: apparet enim non id agi in his ut ipsa rerum natura exploretur et pervestigetur, sed ut quae usus ferat sermonis quotidiani distinguantur alterum ab altero et explicentur.&rsquo; </p>
						<p>In the Metaphysics, the divisions are four. In the first, prior and posterior refer us to a <hi rend="italic">series</hi> and an <hi rend="italic">order</hi>, established either by nature or by the human will, under which the <foreign lang="greek">τῇ γενέσει</foreign> of the Rhetoric will naturally fall. Of this there are five varieties, (1) <foreign lang="greek">κατὰ τόπον</foreign>, local (comp. Phys. IV 11, 219 <hi rend="italic">a</hi> 14, seq.); (2) <foreign lang="greek">κατὰ χρόνον</foreign>, chronological, the order of time (Phys. IV 14, 223 <hi rend="italic">a</hi> 4, seq.); (3) <foreign lang="greek">κατὰ κίνησιν</foreign>; (4) <foreign lang="greek">κατὰ δύναμιν</foreign>, capacity or power; capacity a natural order, power either of nature or human choice; (5) <foreign lang="greek">κατὰ τάξιν</foreign>. </p>
						<p>In the second the order of knowledge is referred to: only in two different applications the meaning of the two terms is inverted: in the order of <hi rend="italic">growth</hi> the particular is prior to the universal, sense and observation to generalisation or induction: in the order of dignity, the universal is prior to the particular, as the whole to the individual parts. The one is <foreign lang="greek">πρότερον πρὸς ἡμᾶς</foreign>, the other, <foreign lang="greek">πρότερον ἁπλῶς</foreign>. </p>
						<p>The third, <foreign lang="greek">πρότερα λέγεται τὰ τῶν προτέρων πάθη</foreign>, the priority of the attributes of the prior (in some series), as straightness is prior to smoothness, because the line is prior to the plane or surface&mdash;the notion is that the plane is <hi rend="italic">generated from</hi>, and so, in growth and origin, posterior to the line; and therefore the attribute of the latter is prior to that of the former&mdash;is not, as Bonitz remarks, coordinate with the three others, &ldquo;pendet enim a reliquis, quae suapte natura sunt priora, tamquam accidens a subiecto suo qui inhaeret.&rdquo; </p>
						<p>The fourth, the <foreign lang="greek">οὐσία</foreign> of the Rhetoric, priority and posteriority in essence or substance, <foreign lang="greek">τὰ κατὰ φύσιν καὶ οὐσίαν</foreign>; priority in this sense belongs to things <foreign lang="greek">ὅσα ἐνδέχεται εἶναι ἄνευ ἄλλων</foreign>: that is, things which are independent of others, whereas the others (the posterior) are dependent on them: the latter imply the former, the former do not necessarily imply the latter. Such is the relation of one and two; two always imply one, <pb n="184"/> one does not necessarily imply two. Similarly the <hi rend="italic">first category</hi>, <foreign lang="greek">οὐσία</foreign> substance, is prior to all the others, which express only properties and attributes of the first. This priority is <foreign lang="greek">οὐσία</foreign>, which is evidently inserted merely because it was suggested by the opposite <foreign lang="greek">γένεσις</foreign>, and being utterly useless in Rhetoric, from which all nice distinctions and subtleties of all kinds are alien, is accordingly passed over in the illustration. This division of <foreign lang="greek">οὐσία</foreign> also includes priority of <foreign lang="greek">δύναμις</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">ἐνέργεια</foreign>, where again the order of growth and of dignity inverts the relation of the two: <foreign lang="greek">δύναμις</foreign>, the capacity, being of course prior in growth or time, the <foreign lang="greek">ἐνέργεια</foreign>, <hi rend="italic">actus</hi>, the realization, or active and perfect condition, being superior in the order of dignity and importance, or in conception, <foreign lang="greek">λόγῳ</foreign>. </p>
						<p>Another division is that of <foreign lang="greek">οὐσίᾳ</foreign> substance, <foreign lang="greek">λόγῳ</foreign> conception, and <foreign lang="greek">χρόνῳ</foreign>. Metaph. <foreign lang="greek">Θ</foreign> 8, 1049 <hi rend="italic">b</hi> 11, seq. </p>

						<p>&lsquo;And all sciences and arts imply the possibility of the existence or generation of their objects&rsquo;.

This I think is the distinction here intended. Moral and political philosophy come under the head of sciences which have facts, moral and social, for the objects of their study; though they belong to the <hi rend="italic">practical</hi> department of knowledge, and have <hi rend="italic">action</hi> for their end and object. <foreign lang="greek">ἐπιστήμη</foreign> and its object <foreign lang="greek">τὸ ἐπιστητόν</foreign>, are relative terms, the one necessarily implying the other, Categ. c. 10, 11 <hi rend="italic">b</hi> 27, <foreign lang="greek">καὶ ἡ ἐπιστήμη δὲ τῷ ἐπιστητῷ ὡς τὰ πρός τι ἀντίκειται</foreign>; and often elsewhere. This may help to establish the necessary connexion which is assumed between knowledge, science, art, and their objects. But I do not suppose that Ar. here means to assert the existence of a natural law which connects them; but only that, as a matter of fact, men never <hi rend="italic">do</hi> choose as an <pb n="185"/> object of study in science, or try their hand at producing by art, anything which they know in the one case to have no real existence, and in the other to be incapable of being produced. </p>

A whole implies its parts, and the parts a whole. Whole and part are relative terms: neither of them can stand alone, nor has any meaning except in reference to its correlative: hence of course the possibility of the one necessarily implies the possibility of the other. <foreign lang="greek">ὅλον λέγεται οὗ μηθὲν ἄπεστι μέρος ἐξ ὧν λέγεται ὅλον φύσει</foreign>, Metaph. <foreign lang="greek">Δ</foreign> 26, 1023 <hi rend="italic">b</hi> 26.

						<p>The qualification, <foreign lang="greek">ὡς ἐπὶ τὸ πολύ</foreign>, of the <hi rend="italic">universal</hi> possibility of the divisibility of a whole into its parts, seems to be introduced to meet the objection which might arise from the existence or conception of <foreign lang="greek">ἀδιαίρετα</foreign>, such as a geometrical point, or an atom, or the human soul, or Parmenides' &lsquo;one&rsquo;, <foreign lang="greek">οὖλον, μουνογενές,...ἓν ξυνεχές</foreign> [Ritter and Preller, <hi rend="italic">Hist.

						<p>Of the parts of a shoe here mentioned we have absolutely no information either in ancient or modern authorities. The explanation of the word <foreign lang="greek">πρόσχισμα</foreign>, given by Photius, who refers to Aristophanes for an example of it, <foreign lang="greek">εἶδος ὑποδήματος</foreign>; and by Hesychius, the same words with the <pb n="186"/> addition of <foreign lang="greek">ἐσχισμένον ἐκ τοῦ ἔμπροσθεν</foreign>, and Pollux&mdash;will not apply <hi rend="italic">here</hi> at all events, nor to Ar. Probl. XXX 8, <foreign lang="greek">ὑπόδημα ἐκ προσχίσματος</foreign>, where it is plainly, as here, a part of the shoe, and not the whole&mdash;though it is probable enough that Aristophanes in the passage referred to by Photius may have meant it by <foreign lang="greek">ὑπόδηματος εἶδος</foreign>: and <foreign lang="greek">κεφαλίς</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">χιτών</foreign> are passed over in total silence: they appear in none of the dictionaries of antiquity that I am acquainted with, nor are the ordinary Lexicons more instructive. We are left therefore to conjecture as to the precise meaning of them, but I think the consideration of the words themselves will <hi rend="italic">help</hi> us at least to understand what they represent. </p>
						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">πρόσχισμα</lemma> is &lsquo;a slit in front&rsquo; of the shoe, with which Aristotle's use of the word in the Problem above quoted exactly agrees. This I think is fully confirmed by a drawing of a <foreign lang="greek">ὑπόδημα</foreign> in Becker's <hi rend="italic">Charicles</hi>, p. 448 (Transl. ed. 2), which is a facsimile of a modern half-boot laced up in front. The <foreign lang="greek">πρόσχισμα</foreign> is the slit down the front, which when the shoe is worn has to be laced up. This seems pretty certain; but of <foreign lang="greek">κεφαλίς</foreign> I can only conjecture from the name, that it is a head-piece, or <hi rend="italic">cap</hi>, covering the <hi rend="italic">toes</hi>, and distinguishing this kind of shoe from those in which the toes were left uncovered, which seems to have been the usual fashion. <foreign lang="greek">χιτών</foreign>&mdash;guided by a very common use of the word, which extends it from a covering of the body to any covering whatsoever (in Rost and Palm's <hi rend="italic">Lexicon</hi>, s. v. No. 2, Vol. II. p. 2466)&mdash;I have supposed to mean the upper leather, the object of which, just like that of the tunic or <hi rend="italic">coat</hi>, is to protect or cover the upper part of the foot, and keep out the cold. Stephens' Lexicon referring to this passage translates <foreign lang="greek">κεφαλίς</foreign> <hi rend="italic">tegumentum capitis!</hi> Xen. Cyrop. VIII 2. 5, (where <foreign lang="greek">σχίζων</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">χιτῶνας</foreign> are used in connexion with shoes,) and Schneider's note, throw no additional light upon the exact meaning of these three words. </p>

The following topics suggest arguments to prove the <hi rend="italic">probability</hi> of some act having been committed which the pleader wishes to establish against his antagonist. </p>
						<p>&lsquo;First of all we may infer that if anything that is naturally less likely to have occurred has happened (been done), then (<hi rend="italic">a fortiori</hi>) anything (of the same kind) that is more usual may probably have happened also&rsquo;. <pb n="189"/> The <hi rend="italic">probability</hi> the degree of which is estimated by the frequency of recurrence, being in the latter case greater.

						<p>&lsquo;And if (in a relation of prior and posterior, antecedent and consequent) the usual consequent (of the antecedent) has happened, then (we may argue that) the antecedent also has happened; as, for instance, the having forgotten something implies a previous learning, some time or other, of the same&rsquo;. Learning is the necessary antecedent of forgetting; without the first the second is impossible. As this is a <hi rend="italic">necessary connexion</hi>, the argument from it is a <foreign lang="greek">τεκμήριον</foreign>, a <hi rend="italic">certain</hi> indication: it is not however convertible, as a necessary sequence; for it does not follow that, because a man can't forget without having first learnt, he also can't learn without afterwards forgetting: the converse is only probable, not necessary. </p>

						<p>When power is combined with the will to do a thing, we may argue that the thing has been done: this is human nature: every one, having the power to do what he wishes, does it; because there is no impediment, nothing to hinder him from the gratification of his desire.

						<p>&lsquo;Further, it may be argued that an act has been done, if the supposed perpetrator had the wish or desire to do it, and no external circumstances stood in his way; or if he had the power of doing it (some injury to another), and at the same time was angry; or if he had at the same time a desire and the power of satisfying it&rsquo;, (the <hi rend="italic">desire</hi> here is especially <hi rend="italic">lust</hi>, and the act done, adultery); &lsquo;for men for the most part are wont to gratify their impulses when they have the power of doing so; the bad from want of self-control, and the good because their desires are good or well-directed (because they desire what is good, and nothing else). </p>
						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ἐβούλετο, ἐπεθύμει</lemma>] &ldquo;<hi rend="italic">Voluit</hi> praevia deliberatione, <hi rend="italic">concupivit</hi> ex affectu.&rdquo; Schrader. If Schrader meant by <hi rend="italic">voluit</hi> that <foreign lang="greek">βούλησις</foreign> is <hi rend="italic">willing</hi> and not <hi rend="italic">wishing</hi>, and that it implies deliberation and purpose, as he certainly seems to say, this is a mistake. I will endeavour to determine the proper signification of <foreign lang="greek">βούλησις</foreign> and its distinction from <foreign lang="greek">ἐπιθυμία</foreign>. </p>
						<p>First, however, it must be admitted that neither of the two terms, <foreign lang="greek">βούλεσθαι</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">ἐπιθυμεῖν</foreign>, is confined exclusively to its own proper and primary sense: these like other terms of psychology are used with a latitude and indefiniteness which belong to a very early stage of inquiry into the constitution of our inner man. For instance, <foreign lang="greek">ἐπιθυμία</foreign>, which properly denotes the three bodily appetites, is often extended to the <pb n="190"/> whole class of <hi rend="italic">desires</hi>, mental as well as bodily; and thus becomes identified or confounded with <foreign lang="greek">βούλησις</foreign>. </p>
						<p>From a comparison of three passages of our author in which we find notices of <foreign lang="greek">βούλησις</foreign>, we draw the inference that it means <hi rend="italic">wish</hi> and not <hi rend="italic">will. Will</hi> implies <hi rend="italic">purpose;</hi> and we are distinctly told in Eth. Nic. III 4, 1111 <hi rend="italic">b</hi> 20 seq. that <foreign lang="greek">βούλησις</foreign> is distinguished from <foreign lang="greek">προαίρεσις</foreign>, deliberate moral purpose, by the absence of this. Further the exercise of <foreign lang="greek">προαίρεσις</foreign> is confined to things which are in our power to do or avoid; the wish sometimes is directed to what is impossible or unattainable, to immortality for instance or happiness. It is also directed to the <hi rend="italic">end</hi>, whereas <foreign lang="greek">προαίρεσις</foreign> looks rather to the means of attaining the end. <foreign lang="greek">τέλος ἐστὶ τῶν πρακτῶν ὃ δἰ αὑτὸ βουλόμεθα</foreign>, Eth. Nic. I 1, 1094 <hi rend="italic">a</hi> 19. Further it is always directed to what is good, real or supposed, Rhet. I 10. 8. Psychologically considered, it belongs to the family of the <foreign lang="greek">ὀρέξεις</foreign>, the instinctive impulses which prompt to action, acting unconsciously and without deliberation. These are three, de Anima II. 3, 414 <hi rend="italic">b</hi> 2, <foreign lang="greek">ὄρεξις μὲν γὰρ ἐπιθυμία</foreign> (appetite) <foreign lang="greek">καὶ θυμός</foreign> (passion, especially anger), <foreign lang="greek">καὶ βούλησις</foreign> (wish, the mental desire of good). (<foreign lang="greek">βούλησις</foreign>, Rhet. u. s., is distinguished from <foreign lang="greek">ἐπιθυμία</foreign>, by this intellectual character of discrimination between good and bad; <foreign lang="greek">ἐπιθυμία</foreign> being a mere animal appetite, <foreign lang="greek">ἄλογος ὄρεξις</foreign>). Comp. de Anima I. 5, 411 <hi rend="italic">a</hi> 28, <foreign lang="greek">ἔτι δὲ τὸ ἐπιθυμεῖν καὶ βούλεσθαι καὶ ὅλως αἱ ὀρέξεις</foreign>, where the two are again distinguished. And in Rhet. u. s. the three <foreign lang="greek">ὀρέξεις</foreign> are divided into <foreign lang="greek">λογιστική</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">ἄλογοι</foreign>, the former character belonging to <foreign lang="greek">βούλησις</foreign>, the latter (irrational) to <foreign lang="greek">θυμός</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">ἐπιθυμία. ἐπιθυμία</foreign> therefore is bodily appetite, and <foreign lang="greek">ἐπεθύμει</foreign> here, as a cause of crime, though not excluding hunger and thirst, refers more particularly to <hi rend="italic">lust.</hi> In the second case, <foreign lang="greek">ἐπιθυμοῦσιν τῶν ἐπιεικῶν</foreign>, &lsquo;desire&rsquo; is extended to intellectual impulses, which can distinguish good from bad; and is thus confounded with <foreign lang="greek">βούλησις</foreign>, which denotes wishing, but not willing. It is to be observed that the discrimination which is exercised by <foreign lang="greek">βούλησις</foreign> in the choice of good, is purely impulsive or instinctive, otherwise it would not be one of the <foreign lang="greek">ὀρέξεις</foreign>: it employs no calculation or deliberation like the <foreign lang="greek">προαίρεσις</foreign> preparatory to decision, and does not always stimulate to action; as when it is directed to impossibilities. </p>
						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">εἰ ἐδύνατο καὶ ὠργίζετο</lemma>] Because anger, as long as it lasts, is always accompanied by the desire of vengeance, which, if a man have the power, he will be sure to wreak on the object of his anger, II 2. 2.

						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">καὶ εἰ ἔμελλε γίγνεσθαι, καὶ ποιεῖν</lemma>] What seems to be meant is this; anything which was on the point of being done, we may assume to have actually happened; or whatever a man was on the point of doing, that he actually did. Expressed at full length this would run, <foreign lang="greek">καὶ εἴ τι ἔμελλε γίγνεσθαι</foreign>, (<foreign lang="greek">ἐγένετο</foreign>)<foreign lang="greek">· καὶ</foreign> (<foreign lang="greek">εἴ τις ἔμελλε</foreign>) <foreign lang="greek">ποιεῖν, ἐποίησεν</foreign>, or <foreign lang="greek">πέπραχεν</foreign> <pb n="191"/> (again from &sect; 18). In any other Greek author one would hardly perhaps venture upon thus supplying an ellipse; but I see no other way of extracting at once sense and Greek from the text. There appears to be no variation in the MSS. Bekker, ed. 3, and Spengel, read <foreign lang="greek">καὶ εἰ ἔμελλε [γίγνεσθαι, καὶ] ποιεῖν</foreign>. In &sect; 19, the latter also puts <foreign lang="greek">ἐβούλετο καὶ</foreign>, and (after <foreign lang="greek">ἐκώλυεν</foreign>) <foreign lang="greek">καὶ εἰ δυνατὸν</foreign> (so A^{c} for <foreign lang="greek">ἐδύνατο</foreign>), in brackets, as interpolations. The last three words are also omitted by MS Z^{b}. It seems to me that, in the two latter cases at least, the text is perfectly intelligible and defensible. The only reason alleged for omitting the five words in brackets in &sect; 19 is that, if we retain them, <foreign lang="greek">εἰ ἐβούλετο...ἐκώλυεν</foreign> is a mere repetition of the preceding <foreign lang="greek">εἰ ἐδύνατο καὶ ἐβούλετο</foreign>. That this is not the case, Victorius has pointed out in his explanation. The former of the two topics, &sect; 18, combines power and wish: both together are certain to produce the act. The latter statement is different; the wish alone is sufficient to produce the act&mdash;provided there are no external impediments in the way: in that case the mere wish, the internal impulse, is <hi rend="italic">not</hi> sufficient. </p>
						<p>&lsquo;For it is natural or likely&mdash;this is all we want for our argument&mdash; that one who is waiting to do something, or on the point of doing it, would also actually carry out his intention, and do it: the probability is that it has been done&rsquo;. </p>
					</div3>
					<div3 id="b2c19s21" type="section" n="21">
						<p>In this connexion of antecedent and consequent, if it is usual, but not necessary, it is a sign, <foreign lang="greek">σημεῖον</foreign>, and uncertain; when necessary, it is a <foreign lang="greek">τεκμήριον</foreign>. Anal. Pr. II 27, sub init. <foreign lang="greek">σημεῖον</foreign> (here including both kinds) <foreign lang="greek">δὲ βούλεται</foreign> (would be, if it could: aspires to be) <foreign lang="greek">εἶναι πρότασις ἀποδεικτικὴ ἀναγκαία ἢ ἔνδοξος· οὗ γὰρ ὄντος ἔστιν ἢ οὗ γενομένου πρότερον, ἢ ὕστερον γέγονε τὸ πρᾶγμα, τοῦτο σημεῖόν ἐστι τοῦ γεγονέναι ἢ εἶναι</foreign>. </p>
						<p>&lsquo;And again, if what had been previously (<foreign lang="greek">πεφύκει</foreign>, &lsquo;had always been&rsquo;, the regular accompaniment) the natural antecedent of so and so, (of the assumed event, or imputed act,) or means to a certain end, has happened, (then the ordinary consequent has happened, or the end aimed at been attained); for instance, we infer from the occurrence of thunder that there has been lightning; and from the <hi rend="italic">attempt</hi>, the execution of a crime&rsquo;. By <foreign lang="greek">ἐπείρασε</foreign>, says Victorius, is meant&mdash;principally, not exclusively &mdash;<hi rend="italic">stuprum</hi>, &lsquo;seduction&rsquo;, the <hi rend="italic">attempt</hi> on a woman's chastity: on this use of the verb <foreign lang="greek">πειρᾷν</foreign> see Ruhnken ad Tim. s. v. p. 210. Timaeus explains it, <foreign lang="greek">πειράζειν διὰ λόγων παῖδα ἢ γυναῖκα</foreign>. Plat. Phaedr. 227 C, Arist. Plut. 150, and Lat. <hi rend="italic">tentare.</hi> </p>
						<p>&lsquo;And (the converse) if what had been the ordinary natural consequent of something else, or the end of certain means (the aim and object of certain actions) has happened, then we infer that the ante<pb n="192"/> cedent in the one case has occurred, the means to the end in the other have been employed, as we infer lightning from thunder, and the attempt from the execution of an act or crime. And of all these cases, in some the connexion is of necessity, in the rest only for the most part&rsquo;. The <hi rend="italic">natural</hi> antecedent and consequent, as the uniform order of nature, is the <hi rend="italic">necessary</hi> connexion: of the uncertain issues of <hi rend="italic">human agency</hi>, <foreign lang="greek">τὰ ἐφ’  ἡμῖν</foreign>, actions which depend upon ourselves and our own will, nothing more than probability can be predicated: <foreign lang="greek">ἀγαπητὸν οὖν περὶ τοιούτων καὶ ἐκ τοιούτων λέγοντας παχυλῶς καὶ τύπῳ τἀληθὲς ἐνδείκνυσθαι, καὶ περὶ τῶν ὡς ἐπὶ τὸ πολὺ καὶ ἐκ τοιούτων λέγοντας τοιαῦτα καὶ συμπεραίνεσθαι</foreign>: the conclusions of moral and social sciences can but amount to probability (Eth. Nic. I 1, 1094 <hi rend="italic">b</hi> 19, <hi rend="italic">et passim</hi>). Consequently, the connexion of motives and actions, and of actions with one another, follows only a general rule, and this rule can never be applied with absolute certainty. </p>

						<p>Materials for arguments on the topic of &lsquo;not happening&rsquo;, the disproof of a statement of fact, may plainly be derived from the opposites of the preceding, which shew how it may be established.

						<p>Arguments for the establishment of the probability of future events and consequences clearly may be derived from the same source: for where the power and the wish to do anything are united, the thing will be done; as likewise when desire, anger, and calculation, are accompanied by the power of gratifying the two first, and carrying out the third. Spengel has again, without manuscript authority, bracketed <foreign lang="greek">καὶ λογισμῷ</foreign> as an interpolation; doubtless because it is not mentioned in &sect;&sect; 18, 19, of which this is a summary. The objection has been already anticipated and answered by Victorius. Calculation or reasoning is implied, he thinks, in the desires of good men, which are always directed to what is good. I cannot think however that this is what Ar. means here by <foreign lang="greek">λογισμός</foreign>. And if we insist upon the strict interpretation of <foreign lang="greek">ἐπιθυμοῦσιν</foreign>, as excluding any operation of the intellect, still it is hard to deny the author the opportunity of supplying in &sect; 23 what he has omitted to notice in &sect; 19. The statement is perfectly true: &lsquo;calculation <hi rend="italic">plus</hi> the power&rsquo; of carrying it out <hi rend="italic">will</hi> produce future consequences: neither does it <hi rend="italic">contradict</hi> anything that has been said before, but merely supplements it. After all even Aristotle is a man, and liable to human infirmities; and certainly his ordinary style of writing is not of that character which would lead us to expect rigorous exactness: on the contrary it is hasty and careless in a degree far beyond the measure of ordinary writing.

						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">διὰ ταῦτα κ.τ.λ.</lemma>] The meaning of this obscure sentence seems to be this:&mdash;It follows from what has just been stated, <foreign lang="greek">διὰ ταῦτα</foreign>&mdash;the statement, that is, that the co-existence of impulse (desire and passion) with power, is a sure source or spring of action&mdash;that the intention which these impulses suggest,&mdash;whether it be immediately, in the very impulse (or, starting-point, first start) to action, or (future) when a man is anxiously waiting for his opportunity (<foreign lang="greek">ἐν μελλήσει</foreign>),&mdash;is most likely to be carried out; and then an <hi rend="italic">additional</hi> reason is assigned for the probability of the future event when it is <hi rend="italic">on the point</hi> of taking place, either immediately, or not long hence, that things that are impending (acts or events) are for the most part much more likely to happen than those that are not impending.

					<p>Having now finished the treatment of the special modes of rhetorical proof, the <foreign lang="greek">εἴδη, ἦθος, πάθος</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">κοινοὶ τόποι</foreign>, we have next to speak of the universal. </p>
					<p>Hitherto the objects of our investigation and analysis have been of a <hi rend="italic">special</hi> character, included under particular sciences, chiefly moral and political, and also, under the three branches of Rhetoric, the topics severally appropriate to each: the <foreign lang="greek">ἦθος</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">πάθος</foreign>, the secondary arguments, by which a favourable impression of the speaker's character is conveyed to the audience, and they themselves brought into the state of feeling which his purpose requires, are likewise confined to Rhetoric: as are also the <foreign lang="greek">κοινοὶ τόποι</foreign>&mdash;<hi rend="italic">common</hi> to all the three branches, though even these are not equally applicable to all, and may therefore in a sense be included under the term <foreign lang="greek">ἴδια</foreign> (so Schrader).&mdash;We now proceed to what remains to be done before we bring the logical and intellectual division of Rhetoric to its conclusion&mdash;to give an account of the two universal methods common to all reasoning of every kind, compared with which all the rest may be called <foreign lang="greek">ἴδια</foreign>, viz. deduction, demonstration, syllogism, and induction; or, as they appear in Rhetoric, in the imperfect forms of enthymeme (inference) and example; which are in fact the only two methods by which we can arrive at truth and knowledge. <foreign lang="greek">ὅτι δ’  οὐ μόνον οἱ διαλεκτικοὶ καὶ ἀποδεικτικοὶ συλλογισμοὶ διὰ τῶν προειρημένων γίνονται σχημάτων</foreign> (the figures of syllogism), <foreign lang="greek">ἀλλὰ καὶ οἱ ῥητορικοί, καὶ ἁπλῶς ἡτισοῦν πίστις καὶ καθ̓</foreign> <pb n="196"/> <foreign lang="greek">ὁποιανοῦν μέθοδον, νῦν ἂν εἴη λεκτέον. ἅπαντα γὰρ πιστεύομεν ἢ διὰ συλλογισμοῦ ἢ ἐξ ἐπαγωγῆς</foreign>.

					<p>&lsquo;These <hi rend="italic">common</hi> (universal) modes of persuasion, or rhetorical proof, are generically two (two in kind as we say; two <hi rend="italic">species</hi> in one <hi rend="italic">genus</hi>), example and enthymeme; for <foreign lang="greek">γνώμη</foreign> is a part of enthymeme&rsquo;.

It seems that this is assigned as a reason for <hi rend="italic">beginning</hi> with <foreign lang="greek">παράδειγμα</foreign>, which is a variety of induction, rather than with <foreign lang="greek">ἐνθύμημα</foreign>, the rhetorical offshoot of <foreign lang="greek">ἀπόδειξις</foreign>, demonstration or deduction.

Of the latter again, one kind is comparison or illustration; the other <foreign lang="greek">λόγοι</foreign>, fables, like Aesop's and the Libyan&rsquo;; (and the fables of Phaedrus, La Fontaine, and Gay). The illustration, &lsquo;those of Aesop and the Libyan&rsquo;, is confined to only one of the two kinds of <foreign lang="greek">λόγοι</foreign>, fables proper, in which animals, plants, or even inanimate objects are endowed with speech and reason: the other includes fictions, tales, stories: analogous cases, fictitious, and made for the occasion, or more usually derived from the writings of poets, especially epic and tragic, philosophers, historians, or any authors of credit. See further on these terms and divisions, Introd. pp. 254&mdash;6, and the <pb n="197"/> references there given: and on <foreign lang="greek">λόγοι</foreign>, &lsquo;fables&rsquo;, p. 255, note. On the Fable, see some excellent remarks in M&uuml;ller, <hi rend="italic">H. G. L.</hi> c. XI 14, 15; and G. C. Lewis, in <hi rend="italic">Phil. Mus.</hi> I 280, &ldquo;On the fables of Babrius.&rdquo; He begins with this definition:&mdash;&ldquo;A fable may be defined to be an analogical narrative, intended to convey some moral lesson, in which irrational animals or objects are introduced as speaking.&rdquo; </p>

						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ἔστι δὲ τὸ μὲν πράγματα λέγειν</lemma>] For <foreign lang="greek">παράδειγμα</foreign> of the older editions, I accept with Bekker, ed. 3, Spengel's alteration <foreign lang="greek">πράγματα λέγειν</foreign>. It is suggested by MS A^{c} <foreign lang="greek">παραδείγματα λέγειν</foreign>, and supported by &sect; 8, <foreign lang="greek">τὰ διὰ τῶν πραγμάτων</foreign>; see in <hi rend="italic">Trans. Bav. Acad.</hi> Munich 1851, p. 49. </p>
						<p>&lsquo;The historical example (<foreign lang="greek">τὸ λέγειν πράγματα προγεγενημένα</foreign>) is of this kind: as if, for instance (a deliberative speaker) were to say, We must arm against the King&rsquo; (the Great King, the King of Persia, as usual without the article), &lsquo;and not allow him to subdue Egypt: for in fact Darius did not cross (the Aegean to attack us) until he had secured (got possession of) Egypt, but as soon as he had done that, he <hi rend="italic">did</hi> cross; and Xerxes again did not make <hi rend="italic">his</hi> attempt upon us until he had seized it, but crossed as soon as he was master of it: and therefore (the <hi rend="italic">inference</hi> from the two <hi rend="italic">examples</hi> or historical parallels) this King also is likely to cross if he is allowed to seize it, so that we must not permit it&rsquo;. The case here given in illustration is probably an imaginary one, <foreign lang="greek">εἴ τις λέγοι</foreign>; and this seems to be Victorius's opinion. But it is barely possible that the recovery of Egypt by Ochus, <foreign lang="greek">ὁ μετονομασθεὶς Ἀρταξέρξης</foreign> (Diod.), about 350 B.C., Clint. <hi rend="italic">Fast. Hell.</hi> 11, p. 316 and note w, may have attracted the attention of the Athenian assembly, and this argument have been used by one of the speakers on the question. Max Schmidt, in his tract <hi rend="italic">On the date of the Rhetoric</hi>, makes use of this passage as helping to fix it, pp. 19&mdash;21. Artaxerxes' expedition to Egypt was undertaken in 351 B. C., and continued through the next year. Both the rival sovereigns, Nectanebus, the reigning king, and Artaxerxes, sent ambassadors to the Greek states for aid, and the subject excited general interest at Athens, as well as in the rest of Greece. It was at this time that Aristotle, who was then employed on his Rhetoric, introduced this illustration, which was suggested by what was actually going on at the time. </p>

						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">παραβολή</lemma> is <hi rend="italic">juxtaposition</hi>, setting one thing <hi rend="italic">by the side</hi> of another for the purpose of <hi rend="italic">comparison</hi> and illustration; taking analogous or <hi rend="italic">parallel</hi> cases; it is the argument from analogy, <foreign lang="greek">ἄν τις δύνηται ὅμοιον ὁρᾷν</foreign>, &sect; 7. A good instance of <foreign lang="greek">παραβολή</foreign> in this sense occurs, Pol. II 5, 1264 <hi rend="italic">b</hi> 4, where Plato is said to derive a <foreign lang="greek">παραβολή</foreign>, or analogy, <foreign lang="greek">ἐκ τῶν θηρίων</foreign> <pb n="198"/> (i.e. dogs), to prove that the pursuits and occupations of men and women should be the same. </p>
						<p>&lsquo;Of <foreign lang="greek">παραβολή</foreign><note anchored="yes"><foreign lang="greek">Παραβολή</foreign> is thus described by Eustath. ad II. A. p. 176 (ap. Gaisford, <foreign lang="greek">λέγεται δὲ παραβολὴ διότι τοῖς λεγομένοις παραβάλλει, τουτέστι συγκρίνει καὶ παρατίθησι, πρᾶγμά τι γνώριμον εἰωθὸς ἀεὶ γίνεσθαι· ὅπερ ὀφείλει πάντως γνωριμώτερον εἶναι τοῦ δἰ ὃ παρείληπται. κακία γὰρ παραβολῆς τὸ ἄγνωστον καὶ ἀσύνηθες...διότι οὐδὲ διδασκαλικὴ ἡ τοιαύτη ἐστὶ παραβολή</foreign>. On the definition, and various definitions of the &lsquo;parable,&rsquo; see Trench on the Parables, Ch. 1 Introd. The author in defining parable, and distinguishing it from fable, seems to confine himself too exclusively to the New Testament parables, when he says that the latter &ldquo;is constructed to set forth a truth spiritual and heavenly,&rdquo; whereas the fable &ldquo;never lifts itself above the earth&rdquo;; it &ldquo;inculcates maxims of prudential morality, industry, caution, foresight,&rdquo; all its morality being of a <hi rend="italic">worldly</hi> character, p. 2. And again, p. 9, &ldquo;the parable differs from the fable, moving as it does in a spiritual world, and never transgressing the actual order of things natural.&rdquo; <hi rend="italic">Aristotle</hi>, to whom Dr Trench does not refer, distinguishes parable <hi rend="italic">in general</hi> from fable by this; that the former depicts <hi rend="italic">human</hi> relations (in which the N. T. parable coincides with it); it <hi rend="italic">invents</hi> analogous cases, which are not <hi rend="italic">historical</hi>, but always such as <hi rend="italic">might</hi> be so; always probable, and corresponding with what actually occurs in real life. The fable is <hi rend="italic">pure fiction</hi>, and its essential characteristic is, that it invests beasts, birds, plants, and even things inanimate with the attributes of humanity.</note> the Socratic practice or method is an example; as for instance if one were to say, that the magistrates ought not to be chosen by lot: for this is analogous to the case of choosing for the athletes (who were to enter the lists) not those who are fitted for the combat, but those upon whom the lot falls; or to choosing the steersman out of a crew of sailors on the principle that it was the man who won the toss, and not the man of knowledge and skill (the man who knows his business), that ought to be chosen&rsquo;. </p>
						<p>This very same analogy is ascribed to Socrates by the accuser at his trial, as one of those which he was in the habit of using, Xen. Memor. I 2. 9. And the same mode of inference, from the analogy of the mechanical and other arts, was transmitted by Socrates to Plato, and through him to his pupil Aristotle, in whose writings it constantly appears in illustration of many of his moral and social and political theories. It is to this practice of Socrates that Critias refers, when he and Charicles, during the tyranny of the Thirty, summoned him before them, and forbade him to continue his dialectical practice and intercourse with the young Athenians. Socrates inquires what sort of questions he is ordered to abstain from. Ib. I 2. 37, <foreign lang="greek">ὁ δὲ Κριτίας, ἀλλὰ τῶνδέ τοί δε ἀπέχεσθαι, ἔφη, δεήσει, ὦ Σώκρατες, τῶν σκυτέων καὶ τῶν τεκτόνων καὶ τῶν χαλκέων· καὶ γὰρ οἶμαι αὐτοὺς ἤδη κατατετρίφθαι διαθρυλλουμένους ὑπὸ σοῦ</foreign>. Similarly Callicles, Plat. Gorg. 491 A, <foreign lang="greek">νὴ τοὺς θεούς, ἀτεχνῶς γε ἀεὶ σκυτέας τε καὶ κναφέας καὶ μαγείρους λέγων καὶ ἰατροὺς οὐδὲν παύει, κ.τ.λ.</foreign> Alcibiades, Sympos. 221 E, <foreign lang="greek">ὄνους γὰρ κανθηλίους λέγει καὶ χαλκέας τινὰς</foreign> <pb n="199"/> <foreign lang="greek">καὶ σκυτοτόμους καὶ βυρσοδέψας, καὶ ἀεὶ διὰ τῶν αὐτῶν ταῦτα φαίνεται λέγειν</foreign>. And Hippias' sneer, Xen. Mem. IV 4, 5 and 6, (Socrates had just compared <hi rend="italic">more suo</hi> the teaching of justice to that of various trades,) <foreign lang="greek">ἔτι γὰρ σύ, ὦ Σώκρατες, τὰ αὐτὰ ἐκεῖνα λέγεις, ἃ ἐγὼ πάλαι ποτέ σου ἤκουσα</foreign>, and Socrates' rejoinder repeated in Gorg. 490 E, 491 B.

					<div3 id="b2c20s5" type="section" n="5">
						<p>The fable may be exemplified by that of Stesichorus about Phalaris, and that of Aesop, in his defence of the demagogue. </p>
						<p>For when the Himereans had elected Phalaris general with absolute power, and were about to give him a body-guard, Stesichorus, after having finished the rest of his argument (or discussion), told them a fable, &lsquo;how a horse was the sole possessor of a meadow, when a stag came, and desiring to take vengeance upon the stag for spoiling his pasture he asked the man (or a man <foreign lang="greek">τινά</foreign>, MS A^{c}, Spengel) if he could help him to chastise the stag: the other assented, on the condition of his accepting a bit and allowing himself to mount him with his javelins: so when he had agreed and the other had mounted, instead of his revenge he himself became a slave henceforth to the man: so likewise you, said he, see to it that ye do not in your desire of vengeance upon your enemies share the fate of the horse: for the bit ye have already&mdash;when ye elected a general with absolute power, but if ye grant him a body-guard and let him get on your backs, <hi rend="italic">then</hi> henceforward ye <hi rend="italic">will</hi> be Phalaris' slaves.&rsquo; The same fable is briefly told by Horace, Ep. 1. 10. 34, <hi rend="italic">Cervus equum pugna melior communibus herbis pellebat</hi>, &amp;c. </p>
						<p>This fable of Stesichorus, which Aristotle here assigns to the age and case of Phalaris, is by Conon &lsquo;a writer in Julius Caesar's time,&rsquo; Bentley, <hi rend="italic">Phalaris</hi>, Vol. 1. p. 106 (ed. Dyce [p. 101 ed. Wagner]) transferred to that of Gelon; and this latter version is regarded by Bentley as the more probable; &lsquo;the circumstances of Gelon's history seem to countenance Conon.&rsquo; &lsquo;If we suppose then with the Arundel marble that Stesichorus lived Ol. LXXIII 3,&rsquo; (this is highly improbable; it places Stesichorus' <hi rend="italic">floruit</hi> a full century too low, in the year B. C. 486; which should indeed be 485, the year in which Gelon became master of Syracuse, Clinton, <hi rend="italic">Fasti Hellenici, sub anno</hi>,) &lsquo;it exactly <pb n="200"/> agrees with the age of Gelon, and Conon's account of the story may seem more credible than Aristotle's. And then all the argument that would settle Phalaris' age from the time of Stesichorus, will vanish into nothing&rsquo; (which is probably Bentley's principal reason for maintaining the paradox). Mure, M&uuml;ller and Clinton, <hi rend="italic">F. H., sub anno</hi> 632, place the date of Stesichorus' birth in B. C. 645, 643 or 632, and 632, severally; &lsquo;so that,&rsquo; says M&uuml;ller, <hi rend="italic">H. G. L.</hi> ch. XIV 4, (as he lived over 80) &lsquo;he might be a contemporary of the Agrigentine tyrant Phalaris, against whose ambitious projects he is said by Aristotle to have warned his fellow-citizens (he was a native of Himera) in an ingenious fable.&rsquo; Mure likewise, Vol. III. p. 226, follows Aristotle. Clinton, <hi rend="italic">F. H.</hi>, places Phalaris' accession to the throne of Agrigentum in B. C. 570. On Phalaris, see Mr Bunbury's article in Smith's <hi rend="italic">Biographical Dictionary.</hi> Mr B. says, it would appear from Aristotle, Rhet.

						<p>&lsquo;And Aesop in Samos as advocate for a demagogue on his trial for a capital offence, said that a fox in crossing a river was driven into a cleft or chasm (in the bank); being unable to get out, she suffered for a long time, and many dog-ticks fastened upon her. And a hedgehog, in his wanderings, when he saw her, took compassion upon her, and asked her, if he should (was to, <hi rend="italic">optative</hi>) remove the dog-ticks from her. But she would not allow it. And upon his asking her why, she replied, because these are already satiated with me and suck (draw) little blood; but if you remove these, others will come, hungry, and drain me of all the blood that is left. But you too, men of Samos, he continued, <hi rend="italic">this</hi> one will do you no more harm, for he has got rich; but if you put him to death, others will come who are poor, and they will waste all your public property by their thefts.&rsquo; </p>

Fragm. 44 (Bergk), <foreign lang="greek">εὕδουσιν ὀρέων κορυφαί τε καὶ φάραγγες</foreign>; and &lsquo;a chasm&rsquo; or &lsquo;cleft&rsquo;, which it bears here. A fox in attempting to cross a rapid river has been carried down by the torrent, and lodged in a rent or chasm of the precipitous bank, and is there caught as it were in a trap, prevented from getting out by the rapidity of the stream in front. This sense of <foreign lang="greek">φάραγξ</foreign> is illustrated by Thuc. II 76, <hi rend="italic">bis</hi>, where it is used of the pits or clefts in the rocks into which the Athenians threw the bodies of the Spartan ambassadors who had been betrayed into their hands and then murdered, the Lacedaemonians having previously treated Athenian prisoners in the same manner, <foreign lang="greek">ἀπέκτειναν πάντας καὶ ἐς φάραγγας ἐνέβαλον</foreign>.

It is there translated &ldquo;the style sententious.&rdquo; <foreign lang="greek">γνωμολογία</foreign> is here, at any rate, the science or study, the theory (<foreign lang="greek">λόγος</foreign>), and (in Rhetoric) the use or practical application, of <foreign lang="greek">γνᾶμαι</foreign>, maxims or general moral sentiments; after the analogy of <foreign lang="greek">ἀστρολογία, μετεωρολογία, δικολογία</foreign> (Rhet. I 1. 10), <foreign lang="greek">φυσιολογία</foreign> (Plut.) and a great number of modern sciences; the <hi rend="italic">use</hi> of the maxim predominates in the application of <foreign lang="greek">γνωμολογεῖν</foreign> throughout the chapter.</note>. As to (the art of) maxim-making, we shall best arrive at a clear understanding of the objects, times, and persons, to which and at which the employment of it is most appropriate in our speeches, when it has been first stated what a maxim is. </p>

					<div3 id="b2c21s2" type="section" n="2">
						<p>&lsquo;A maxim is a declaration&mdash;not however of particulars or individuals, as, for instance, what sort of a person Iphicrates is, but universally (a general statement, an universal moral rule or principle)&rsquo;. <foreign lang="greek">ἀπό-</foreign> <pb n="205"/> <foreign lang="greek">φανσις</foreign> (<foreign lang="greek">ἀποφαίνειν</foreign>) a &lsquo;declaration&rsquo; or &lsquo;utterance&rsquo;. Here again we have in two MSS the <hi rend="italic">varia lectio</hi> <foreign lang="greek">ἀπόφασις</foreign>. See on this, note on I 8. 2. Comp. &sect; 9, <foreign lang="greek">οἱ ἀγροῖκοι μάλιστα γνωμοτύποι εἰσὶ καὶ ῥᾳδίως ἀποφαίνονται</foreign>, and &sect; 16, <foreign lang="greek">διὰ τὸ ἀποφαίνεσθαι τὸν τὴν γνώμην λέγοντα</foreign>... </p>
						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ἀποφαίνεσθαι</lemma> seems to have some special connexion with <foreign lang="greek">γνώμη</foreign> in its ordinary signification as well as this technical application. See Heindorf on Gorg. &sect; 48, p. 466 C. In several passages which the quotes the same verb is used for <hi rend="italic">declaring</hi> a <foreign lang="greek">γνώμη</foreign>, in the sense of <hi rend="italic">opinion.</hi> [&ldquo;So Protag. 336 D, <foreign lang="greek">τὴν ἑαυτοῦ γνώμην ἀποφαίνεσθαι</foreign>; ib. 340 B.&rdquo; Dr Thompson on Gorg. 1. c.] </p>
						<p>&lsquo;And not of all universals, as, for example, that straight is opposed to crooked, but only of those which are concerned with (human) actions, and are to be chosen or avoided in respect of action.&rsquo; This concern with human action&mdash;<foreign lang="greek">πρᾶξις</foreign> can only be predicated of human beings&mdash;gives the <foreign lang="greek">γνώμη</foreign> its <hi rend="italic">moral</hi> character. See, for instance, the beginning of the second chapter of Eth. Nic. II. Of actions it is said, 1104 <hi rend="italic">a</hi> 31, <foreign lang="greek">αὗται γάρ· εἰσι κύριαι καὶ τοῦ ποιὰς γενέσθαι τὰς ἕξεις</foreign>; they determine the moral character. And so frequently elsewhere. This moral character of the <foreign lang="greek">γνώμη</foreign> however, though it undoubtedly predominates in the description and illustration of it through the remainder of the chapter, is not absolutely exclusive: the <foreign lang="greek">γνώμη</foreign> may be applied likewise to all practical business of life, and all objects of human interest, as health in &sect; 5; and <foreign lang="greek">πράξεις</foreign> must be supposed virtually to include these. With this definition that of Auct. ad Heren. IV 17. 24 deserves to be compared: it is not so complete as Aristotle's, but may be regarded as supplementary to it: <hi rend="italic">Sententia</hi> (i. e. <foreign lang="greek">γνώμη</foreign>, which is also the term by which Quintilian expresses it, Inst. Orat. VIII 5) <hi rend="italic">est oratio sumpta de vita, quae aut quid sit aut quid esse oporteat in vita breviter ostendit, hoc pacto;</hi> it is there illustrated to the end of the chapter. One useful precept for the guidance of the rhetorician in the employment of the <foreign lang="greek">γνώμη</foreign> may be quoted here, especially as Aristotle has omitted it. <hi rend="italic">Sententias interponi raro convenit, ut rei actores, non vivendi praeceptores videamur esse.</hi> <foreign lang="greek">γνῶμαι</foreign> often take the form of &lsquo;precepts&rsquo;. Harris, u. s, p. 182. </p>
						<p>&lsquo;And therefore since rhetorical enthymemes are as one may say&rsquo; <pb n="206"/> (<foreign lang="greek">σχεδόν</foreign> &lsquo;pretty nearly&rsquo;, that is, not absolutely, but generally, making allowance for some which are <hi rend="italic">not</hi> concerned with the practical business of life&mdash;so Victorius) &lsquo;the logical mode of reasoning or inference on these subjects (the business of life and human actions), when this syllogistic process is withdrawn (and the major premiss or conclusion is left alone), the conclusions and major premisses of enthymemes are <foreign lang="greek">γνῶμαι</foreign>&rsquo;. These premisses and conclusions taken by themselves are mere <hi rend="italic">enunciations</hi> of some general principle: they do not become enthymemes, i. e. inferences or processes of <hi rend="italic">reasoning</hi>, till <hi rend="italic">the reason</hi> is added&mdash;sententia <hi rend="italic">cum ratione</hi>, Quint. and Auct. ad Heren., Introd. p. 257&mdash;which is stated in the next sentence. <hi rend="italic">Hanc quidem partem enthymematis quidam initium aut clausulam epichirematis esse dixerunt: et est aliquando, non tamen semper.</hi> Quint. VIII 5. 4 (de Sententiis, VIII 5. 1&mdash;8, q. v.). </p>
						<p>&lsquo;For instance, &ldquo;No man that is of sound mind ought ever to have his children over-educated to excess in learning,&rdquo; (Eur. Med. 294). Now this is a maxim (moral precept, the <hi rend="italic">conclusion</hi> of the enthymeme): but the addition of the reason, and the why (the <foreign lang="greek">αἰτία</foreign> or cause) makes the whole an enthymeme, for example, &ldquo;for besides the idle habits which they thereby contract to boot&rdquo; (into the bargain&mdash;the <hi rend="italic">comparative</hi> <foreign lang="greek">ἄλλος</foreign>, other, in this common, but illogical use of the word, brings two heterogeneous things into illicit comparison: see [p. 46 <hi rend="italic">supra</hi> and note on III 1. 9]) &ldquo;they reap (gain as their reward) hostile jealousy from the citizens.&rdquo; The <foreign lang="greek">ἀργία</foreign> here is the literary indolence, or inactivity, the withdrawal from active life and the consequent neglect of their duties as citizens, into which they are led by their studious habits. This is what provokes the jealousy and hostility of the citizens. Plato's unpopularity at Athens was due to the same cause. Plato justifies himself against these charges of his enemies in four well known passages, in the Republic [VI 484&mdash;497], Theaetetus [172 C] and Gorgias [527]; and in the seventh Epistle, if that be his [see Introd. to Dr Thompson's ed. of the Gorgias, pp. xii&mdash;xiv]. </p>
						<p>These lines are put into the enthymematic form, as an argument, in &sect; 7. It is a specimen of a <hi rend="italic">practical syllogism</hi>, or enthymeme, logic applied to action or conduct. As a syllogism it would run thus: All <pb n="207"/> ought to avoid, or no man should be rendered liable to, idle habits and the hatred of his fellow-citizens: children who are over-educated do become idle and unpopular; therefore children ought not to be overeducated. </p>
						<p>&lsquo;And again, &ldquo;There is no man who is altogether happy&rdquo;&rsquo;&mdash;Eur. Fragm. Sthenel. I (Dind., Wagn.). The <hi rend="italic">reason</hi>, which converts it into an enthymeme, is supplied by Aristoph. Ran. 1217, <foreign lang="greek">ἢ γὰρ πεφυκὼς ἐσθλὸς οὐκ ἔχει βίον, ἢ δυσγενὴς ὤν</foreign>, (he is here interrupted by Aeschylus who finishes the verse for him with <foreign lang="greek">ληκύθιον ἀπώλεσεν</foreign>: but the Schol. supplies the conclusion,) <foreign lang="greek">πλουσίαν ἀροῖ πλάκα</foreign>. </p>
						<p>&lsquo;And another, &ldquo;there is none of mankind that is free&rdquo;&rsquo; is a <foreign lang="greek">γνώμη</foreign>, but with the addition of the next verse (<foreign lang="greek">τῷ ἐχομένῳ ἔπει</foreign>) it becomes an enthymeme, &lsquo;&ldquo;for he is the slave either of money or fortune.&rdquo;&rsquo; From Eur. Hec. 864. Our texts have <foreign lang="greek">θνητῶν</foreign> for <foreign lang="greek">ἀνδρῶν</foreign>: doubtless it is one of Ar.'s ordinary slips of memory in quotation, and a very unimportant one. But I think as a general rule, it is quite unsafe to rely upon our author's quotations in correction of any reading in more ancient writers. </p>
					</div3>
					<div3 id="b2c21s3" type="section" n="3">
						<p>&lsquo;If then a <foreign lang="greek">γνώμη</foreign> is what has been described, there must necessarily be four kinds of <foreign lang="greek">γνώμη</foreign>: either with, or without, an appendage or supplement (containing the reason)&rsquo;. It is first put forward independently as a <foreign lang="greek">γνώμη</foreign>, and then, if it is not generally acceptable, and a reason is required, this is added, and it becomes an enthymeme. </p>
					</div3>
					<div3 id="b2c21s4" type="section" n="4">
						<p>&lsquo;Those that require proof (<foreign lang="greek">ἀπόδειξις</foreign> &lsquo;demonstration&rsquo;, as before, used loosely for proof of any kind) are all such as state anything paradoxical (contrary to received opinion; or surprising, unexpected, contrary to expectation, and to anything that you ever heard before) or anything which is questioned (or open to question): those that have nothing unexpected about them (may be stated, <foreign lang="greek">λέγονται</foreign>) without a supplement&rsquo;. These together make up the four kinds. </p>
					</div3>
					<div3 id="b2c21s5" type="section" n="5">
						<p>The first two kinds are those which require no supplement. &lsquo;Of these, some must require no supplement owing to their being already well known, as, &ldquo;best of all is wealth for a man, at least in my opinion;&rdquo; because most people think so&rsquo;. </p>
						<p>The line here quoted is of uncertain origin. There was a famous <foreign lang="greek">σκόλιον</foreign>, drinking-song or catch, usually attributed to Simonides, which Athen., XV 694 E, has preserved amongst several that he there quotes; and it is also to be found in Bergk's Collection, <hi rend="italic">Fragm. Lyr. Gr.</hi> Scolia, <pb n="208"/> 13. It runs thus: <foreign lang="greek">ὑγιαίνειν μὲν ἄριστον ἀνδρὶ θνατῷ, δεύτερον δὲ καλὸν φύαν γενέσθαι, τὸ τρίτον δὲ πλουτεῖν ἀδόλως, καὶ τὸ τέταρτον ἡβᾷν μετὰ τῶν φίλων</foreign>. This is repeated by Anaxandrides in some iambics of his Thesaurus, Fragm. I (Meineke, <hi rend="italic">Fr. Comm. Gr.</hi> III 169), and quoted by Athen. immediately after the <foreign lang="greek">σκόλιον</foreign> as a parallel or illustration. Anaxandrides does not know the author; <foreign lang="greek">ὁ τὸ σκόλιον εὑρὼν ἐκεῖνος, ὅστις ἦν</foreign>. Plato has likewise quoted it in Gorg. 451 E, and elsewhere (see Stallbaum's note). The Scholiast on this passage says, <foreign lang="greek">τὸ σκόλιον τοῦτο οἱ μὲν Σιμωνίδου φασίν, οἱ δὲ Ἐπιχάρμου</foreign>. On which Meineke, u. s., note, says &lsquo;Nonne igitur pro <foreign lang="greek">ἡμῖν</foreign> legendum <foreign lang="greek">ἐμίν</foreign>, et ipse ille versus, <foreign lang="greek">ἀνδρὶ δ’  ὑγιαίνειν κ.τ.λ.</foreign>, Epicharmo tribuendus?&rsquo; The trochaic metre is doubtless in favour of this supposition, but that shews on the other hand that it could not have formed part of the scolion above quoted, which is in quite a different measure: and also, supposing it to be taken from that, it would be a most improbable and unmeaning repetition of the first line. If therefore Meineke is right in attributing it to Epicharmus, it must have belonged to another and independent scolion. Another scholium in Cramer, Anecd. Paris. on Ar. Rhet. has <foreign lang="greek">τὸ ἀνδρὶ δ’  ὑγιαίνειν ἄριστον Σιμωνίδου ἐστὶν ἀπὸ τῶν σκολιῶν αὐτοῦ ἐπῶν. οἳ δ̓ Ἐπιχάρμου</foreign>. Meineke, u. s. Simonides at all events has something like it, <foreign lang="greek">οὐδὲ καλᾶς σοφίας χάρις, εἰ μή τις ἔχει σεμνὰν ὑγίειαν</foreign>. This places health at the head of the list of goods: another distich, quoted in Ar. Eth. Nic. I 9, Eth. Eudem. init., as &lsquo;the Delian inscription&rsquo; <foreign lang="greek">ἐπὶ τὸ προπύλαιον τοῦ Λητῴου</foreign> (Eth. Eud.), Theogn. 255, and (in iambics) Soph. Fragm. Creus. (Stob. CIII 15, Dind. Fr. 326), places health second in the order, or rather, perhaps, leaves the question open. Ariphron of Sicyon (Athen. XV 702 A) wrote a hymn to Health, beginning <foreign lang="greek">ὑγίεια πρεσβίστα μακάρων</foreign>; he also regards it as the greatest of all blessings, <foreign lang="greek">σέθεν δὲ χωρὶς οὔτις εὐδαίμων ἔφυ</foreign>, line 8. See in Bergk, <hi rend="italic">Fr. Lyr. Gr.</hi> p. 841 [p. 984, ed. 2]. Comp. Philem. Fr. Inc. 62, <foreign lang="greek">αἰτῶ δ’  ὑγίειαν πρῶτον, εἶτ̓ εὐπραξίαν κ.τ.λ.</foreign> </p>

						<p>&lsquo;Of those which have the supplement (these are the two kinds <pb n="209"/> of the second division), some are part of an enthymeme, as &ldquo;no man of sound mind ought,&rdquo; (the commencement of the verses of Euripides in &sect; 2), and the rest have an enthymematic character, but are not part of an enthymeme: which (the latter) are in fact the most popular&rsquo;. <foreign lang="greek">αἱ μὲν ἐνθυμήματος μέρος</foreign> may be thought to be a careless expression, contradictory to the description of enthymeme in I 2. 13: since it is characteristic of the enthymeme that it omits at least one of the premisses (see on the enthymeme Introd. p. 104), and therefore a <foreign lang="greek">γνώμη</foreign> with the reason appended represents a conclusion with one premiss, which is an enthymeme. The explanation seems to be that an enthymeme is an <hi rend="italic">assumed</hi> syllogism: the inference which it draws rests upon the possibility of constructing a syllogism out of it: if that cannot be done, the inference is not valid. So that in one sense the enthymeme is a true and complete syllogism, in another, in so far as it <hi rend="italic">expresses</hi> only <hi rend="italic">one</hi> premiss, it may be called <hi rend="italic">a part</hi> of it, and incomplete. And this serves to explain the statement of I 2. 13, <foreign lang="greek">τὸ δ’  ἐνθύμημα συλλογισμόν</foreign> (i. e. a mode of syllogistic reasoning), <foreign lang="greek">καὶ ἐξ ὀλίγων τε καὶ πολλάκις ἐλαττόνων ἢ ἐξ ὧν ὁ πρῶτος συλλογισμός</foreign>. </p>
						<p>&lsquo;And all those have this (latter) character in which the reason of the (general) statement is made to appear, as in this, &ldquo;mortal as thou art, guard, keep (cherish), not immortal anger;&rdquo; for, to say &ldquo;that a man ought not to keep his anger for ever&rdquo; is a <foreign lang="greek">γνώμη</foreign>; but the addition, &ldquo;as a mortal&rdquo; (<hi rend="italic">because</hi> he is a mortal), states the (reason) <hi rend="italic">why.</hi> And like it again is this, &ldquo;Mortal thoughts&rdquo; (or a mortal spirit&mdash;that is, one which confines its aims and aspirations within the limits of its mortal condition), &ldquo;not immortal, become a mortal man.&rdquo;&rsquo; </p>
						<p>The first of these two quotations is used by Bentley in his <hi rend="italic">Dissertation on Phalaris</hi>, p. 247 [p. 229 ed. Wagner], and foll. He does not attempt to fix the authorship of it, but contents himself with saying &ldquo;this, though the author of it be not named, was probably...borrowed from the stage,&rdquo; p. 247, but afterwards, p. 249 [231], &ldquo;and even that one (the verse in question) is very likely to be taken from the same place&rdquo; (viz. Euripides). Subsequently, p. 262 [243], he speaks of it as from &ldquo;a poet cited by Aristotle,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Aristotle's poet.&rdquo; He quotes from Euripides' Philoctetes, Fragm. IX (Dind.), XII (Wagner), a parallel passage as having been borrowed by the author of Phalaris, <foreign lang="greek">ὥσπερ δὲ θνητὸν καὶ τὸ σῶμ’  ἡμῶν ἔφυ, οὕτω προσήκει μηδὲ τὴν ὀργὴν ἔχειν ἀθάνατον, ὅστις σωφρονεῖν ἐπίσταται</foreign>.

						<p>The second verse, <foreign lang="greek">θνατὰ χρή κ.τ.λ.</foreign>, is ascribed by Bentley to Epicharmus; a supposition with which the dialect and metre agree.

						<p>&lsquo;The use of maxims, or sententious language, is appropriate in respect of age (time of life) to elders, and as to subjects, should be directed to those in which the speaker has experience; since for one who is not so far advanced in life to employ maxims is as unbecoming as story-telling (i. e. fables, legends, mythical stories), whilst to talk about things that one knows nothing of is a mark of folly and ignorance (or want of cultivation)&rsquo;. On <foreign lang="greek">μυθολογεῖν</foreign> Victorius says, &ldquo;Fabellarum sane auditione delectantur pueri; non tamen ipsis fabulas fingere aut narrare congruit.&rdquo; And this, because young people have as yet had little or no experience of life, and if they pronounce maxims and precepts at all, must do it of things of which they are ignorant: and this shews folly, as well as ignorance.

The restless, excitable, intriguing spirit, the love of novelty and foreign adventure, the sanguine temper, quick wit, and daring audacity, therein described, must necessarily have made them the most troublesome and dangerous of neighbours; ever ready to interfere in their neighbours' affairs, and form schemes of aggrandisement at their neighbours' expense. Another proverb of the same kind is mentioned by Schrader as having been applied to the Franks, <hi rend="italic">Francum amicum habeas, vicinum non habeas:</hi> it is found in Eginherd's <hi rend="italic">Life of Charlemagne.</hi> Gibbon also refers to it, without naming his authority. In the 10th century at Constantinople, &ldquo;a proverb, that the Franks were good friends and bad neighbours, was in every one's mouth.&rdquo; <hi rend="italic">Decline and Fall</hi>, ch. XLIX.

						<p>&lsquo;Maxims may also be cited in opposition to, or in contradiction of, those that have become public property&mdash;by these I mean such as &lsquo;know thyself&rsquo;, &lsquo;avoid excess&rsquo; (the maxims or adages of Solon and Chilon)&mdash;whenever one's character is likely to be put in a more favourable light (thereby), or the <foreign lang="greek">γνώμη</foreign> has been pronounced in an excited state of feeling (by the opponent who is to be answered); of this &lsquo;pathetic&rsquo; <foreign lang="greek">γνώμη</foreign> an instance is, if for example a man in a fit of passion were to say that it is false that a man is bound to know himself, &ldquo;this gentleman at any rate, if he knew himself, would never have claimed to be elected general.&rdquo;&rsquo; </p>
						<p>Aristotle has said that there are two classes of cases in which a <pb n="217"/> generally accepted or &lsquo;universal&rsquo; maxim&mdash;such as Solon's <foreign lang="greek">γνῶθι σεαυτόν</foreign>&mdash;may be contradicted <hi rend="italic">with effect.</hi> One of these is, when the <foreign lang="greek">γνώμη</foreign> itself, including the contradiction of it&mdash;as appears from the example&mdash; is uttered in a state of excited feeling, real or assumed, such as indignation. The example of this is a man <hi rend="italic">in a fit of passion</hi>, <foreign lang="greek">ὀργιζόμενος</foreign>, loudly asserting that Solon's universally accepted maxim, or the precept conveyed by it, is untrue, or at any rate liable to exception; for if so and so (some imaginary person) had had a true knowledge of himself (and his own incapacity) he never would have aspired to be a general: but he <hi rend="italic">has</hi> done so, and succeeded in the attempt: and this <hi rend="italic">success</hi> shews the falsity of the rule, as a prudential maxim, at any rate in this case; and also being <hi rend="italic">undeserved</hi> provokes the indignation of the speaker. And it is to be observed that this success without merit is <hi rend="italic">necessary</hi> to inspire the feeling, the existence of which is distinctly stated. The case is that of Cleon, Thuc. IV 27 seq. Victorius however understands it in a different sense. According to him the case is that of an Iphicrates, who raised himself from a low condition to the height of power and distinction; Rhet. I 7. 32, <foreign lang="greek">Ἰφικράτης αὑτὸν ἐνεκωμίαζε λέγων ἐξ ὧν ὑπῆρξε ταῦτα</foreign>; I 9. 31, <foreign lang="greek">ἐξ οἵων εἰς οἷα</foreign>, (<foreign lang="greek">τὸ τοῦ Ἰφικράτους</foreign>); if Iphicrates had &lsquo;known himself&rsquo;, i. e. remembered his origin, he never could have entered upon such a career. But it seems to me that this is not a proper interpretation of &lsquo;self-knowledge&rsquo;, and that the maxim could not be applied in this sense: the mere recollection of his former low estate surely is not entitled to the name of knowledge of self. Iphicrates, instead of disobeying the precept, conformed to it in the strictest sense; he did <hi rend="italic">know himself</hi> so well, he was so fully aware of his capacity for fulfilling the duties of the office, that he did not hesitate to apply for and exercise the command of an army. Victorius' words are; &ldquo;<foreign lang="greek">παθητικῶς</foreign> dicet, qui ira percitus ita loquetur&rdquo; (but what is the <hi rend="italic">occasion</hi> of the anger, when it is thus interpreted? The mere contradiction of an universal maxim does not give rise to a fit of passion), &ldquo;falsum est omnino, quod aiunt, debere homines seipsos nosse: hic enim profecto si se ipsum cognosset nunquam praetor ducere exercitum voluisset.&rdquo; It may perhaps be meant that the speaker <hi rend="italic">assumes</hi> indignation in order to give force to his contradiction: or really gets into a passion at the thought of the folly of mankind for believing it. </p>
						<p>&lsquo;Our character is bettered, men's opinion of our character is improved, by saying for instance (<hi rend="italic">subaudi</hi> <foreign lang="greek">οἷον εἴ τις λέγοι</foreign>, <hi rend="italic">aut tale aliquid</hi>) that we ought not, as is said, to love as with the prospect of our love being turned into hatred, but rather the reverse, to hate as if that was likely to become love&rsquo;.

					<div3 id="b2c21s14" type="section" n="14">
						<p>&lsquo;The language (statement, expression) should be accompanied <pb n="218"/> by the manifestation of the deliberate moral purpose (by which the moral character of every thought and action is estimated), or if not, the reason (at any rate) should be added; as thus &ldquo;a man's love should be, not as people say, but as though it were to be lasting (as deep and fervent and assured, as though it were to endure for ever); for the other (the reverse) has the character of treachery (belongs to, is characteristic of, a designing, plotting, treacherous man; implying deceit together with evil designs of future mischief).&rdquo;&rsquo; This is the construction that <hi rend="italic">may</hi> be put upon it: it also admits of a more favourable interpretation: see the note on II 13. 4, already referred to. &lsquo;Or thus, &ldquo;but the statement, the maxim, does not satisfy me: for the true, sincere, genuine friend should love as if his love were to last for ever.&rdquo; And again, neither does the (maxim) &ldquo;nothing to excess (satisfy me); for the wicked surely should be hated to excess.&rdquo;&rsquo; </p>

						<p>&lsquo;These <foreign lang="greek">γνῶμαι</foreign> are of the greatest service (help) to our speeches &mdash;one of which&rsquo; (the other follows in the next section) &lsquo;is due to, arises out of, the want of cultivation and intelligence in the audience; for they are delighted if ever any one chance to light upon, and express in general terms, any opinion that they hold themselves, but partially&rsquo;. </p>
						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">φορτικότης</lemma>, as far as Classical Greek is concerned, appears to be a <foreign lang="greek">ἅπαξ λεγόμενον</foreign>: it is found also in Eustathius (Steph. <hi rend="italic">Thes.</hi> sub v.). <foreign lang="greek">φορτικός</foreign>, from <foreign lang="greek">φόρτος</foreign> a burden or load, burden-like, burden-ish, and hence met. burdensome, oppressive, annoying: especially applied to <hi rend="italic">vulgarity</hi>, in person, manners, or intellect. The last of these senses, intellectual vulgarity, the want of cultivation and refinement, and especially of philosophical cultivation&mdash;a coarse and vulgar habit of mind, which looks merely at the surface of things, with little or no faculty of observation or power of distinction, and contents itself with a mere vulgar knowledge shared with the mass of mankind&mdash;is, if not <hi rend="italic">peculiar</hi> to Aristotle, at any rate much more commonly found in his writings than in others. In this sense the <foreign lang="greek">φορτικός</foreign> does not differ much from the <foreign lang="greek">ἀπαίδευτος</foreign>, and is opposed to the <foreign lang="greek">χαριείς</foreign>, which, in Aristotle, often expresses the <hi rend="italic">highest degree</hi> of <hi rend="italic">grace</hi> and refinement, arising from the study of philosophy. It is in this signification that the word is used here, meaning a want of intelligence and of philosophical or (generally) intellectual training, which disqualifies men for making distinctions and estimating the value of an argument; consequently they measure the validity of a <pb n="219"/> reason not by its logical force or cogency, but by its coincidence with their own previously conceived opinions; which they love to hear exaggerated by the orator, who humours them by these illicit generalisations. The Scholiast explains it <foreign lang="greek">ἀγροικίαν</foreign>. Victorius has, I think, entirely mistaken the meaning of the word. The <foreign lang="greek">φορτικότης</foreign> here ascribed to vulgar audiences is much the same as the <foreign lang="greek">μοχθηρία τῶν ἀκροατῶν</foreign>, III 1. 5, the vices or defects, which oblige the orator to have recourse to <foreign lang="greek">τἆλλα ἔξω τοῦ ἀποδεῖξαι</foreign> in order to convince them, because they are unable to appreciate logic alone.

						<p>&lsquo;This then is one use (or usefulness, advantage) of the employment of <foreign lang="greek">γνῶμαι</foreign>, there is also another, and a better; that is, that it gives an ethical character to our speeches.

On which Schrader, &ldquo;ratio seligendi enthymemata differt a locis ipsis. Quomodo aliud est argenti fodina, aliud argentum investigandi et explorandi modus.&rdquo; </p>
					</div3>
					<div3 id="b2c22s2" type="section" n="2">
						<p>&lsquo;Now that the enthymeme is a kind of syllogism has been already stated (I 2. 8, and 13), and also how (in what respects) it is a syllogism, and wherein it differs from those of dialectics (I 2. 11); for&rsquo;&mdash; these are two of the differences&mdash;&lsquo;we must neither go very far back, nor introduce all the steps (of the regular syllogism), in drawing our inferences; the one is obscure by reason of its length, the other is mere chattering (idle talk, or vain repetition, leading to nothing, III 3. 3), because it states what everybody sees already (what is already evident)&rsquo;. </p>
						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">οὔτε γὰρ πόρρωθεν κ τ.λ.</lemma>] This is a manifest reference to I 2. 13, where <hi rend="italic">both</hi> of these two things which the rhetorician has to avoid are expressly mentioned. </p>
						<p>First, he must not deduce his inference, the conclusion which he wishes to establish, by a long train of connected syllogisms from a remote distance, <foreign lang="greek">συλλογίζεσθαι καὶ συνάγειν ἐκ συλλελογισμένων πρότερον... ἀνάγκη μὴ εἶναι εὐεπακολούθητον διὰ τὸ μῆκος, ὁ γὰρ κριτὴς ὑπόκειται εἶναι ἁπλοῦς</foreign>. Comp. I 2. 12, <foreign lang="greek">ἔστι τὸ ἔργον αὐτῆς</foreign> (<foreign lang="greek">τῆς ῥητορικῆς</foreign>)...<foreign lang="greek">ἐν τοῖς τοιούτοις ἀκροαταῖς οἳ οὐ δύνανται διὰ πολλῶν συνορᾶν οὐδὲ λογίζεσθαι πόρρωθεν</foreign>. (Comp. Topic. A 11, 105 <hi rend="italic">a</hi> 8, where this is extended to dialectical argumentation. A similar precept is given in III 17. 6. <foreign lang="greek">πόρρωθεν</foreign> of &lsquo;farfetched&rsquo; metaphors, III 2. 12. Comp. III 3. 4.) This will only puzzle his &lsquo;simple&rsquo; audience, whose powers of perception and memory will be alike unable to keep pace with him. The reasoning of the rhetorician must be as clear and as brief as possible. </p>
						<p>Secondly, he must draw his conclusion without expressing all that <pb n="222"/> belongs to the regular syllogism; this is also for the sake of brevity; the formal syllogism is unsuitable to the orator who has a great deal to say, and is hastening to his conclusion, fearing to weary his audience, because it <hi rend="italic">expresses</hi> a great deal that is self-evident, and may well be left for the hearers themselves to supply. Besides this, the enthymeme which he employs obliges him to omit either one of the two premisses or the conclusion; which of them it is to be, depends upon the degree in which the reasoning will be intelligible without it: anything that is absolutely <foreign lang="greek">φανερόν</foreign> should (in reasoning) be omitted to save time. These are the two points in which the use of the enthymeme differs from that of the dialectical syllogism. </p>
						<p>With respect to the first, the dialectician, whose object is merely to gain the victory in the dispute, and who has an antagonist more or less a match for him, can take his own time, and need not accommodate his reasoning to the intelligence of his opponent: to the rhetorician, the time allowed is generally limited, he has usually an uneducated and perhaps unintelligent audience to address, which he must keep in good humour, and therefore neither puzzle nor weary. The second point conveys the essential difference between the enthymeme and dialectical syllogism, that in the former <foreign lang="greek">οὐ πάντα δεῖ λαμβάνοντας συνάγειν. πάντα</foreign> may also include, what Schrader adds, &ldquo;multas propositiones probabiles, communes, intempestivas,&rdquo; which &ldquo;plane omitti debere praecipit.&rdquo; </p>
						<p>On <foreign lang="greek">ἀδολεσχία</foreign>, see note on III 3. 3. Eth. N. III 13, 1118 <hi rend="italic">a</hi> I. Comp. de Soph. El. c. 3, 165 <hi rend="italic">b</hi> 15. </p>
						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">τοῦτο γάρ</lemma>] <foreign lang="greek">γάρ</foreign> here can hardly bear its usual signification, that of &lsquo;a reason assigned&rsquo;: the fact&mdash;that the uneducated are more convincing to a mob than your philosopher&mdash;is not the reason of the preceding statement, but rather the reverse; the previous statement explains (supplies the reason or explanation of) the fact. It must therefore be a case of that use of <foreign lang="greek">γάρ</foreign> which Schleiermacher in his translation of Plato represents by <hi rend="italic">n&auml;mlich, videlicet;</hi> a use of the word which frequently occurs in the Platonic dialogues. And so I have translated it: though it is to be observed that if <hi rend="italic">n&auml;mlich</hi> always represents the Greek <foreign lang="greek">γάρ</foreign> (in these special cases), the English &lsquo;namely&rsquo; will not always represent the German <hi rend="italic">n&auml;mlich.</hi> [Comp. note 1 on p. 134, and Shilleto on Thuc. I. 25. 4.] </p>
						<p>&lsquo;This, <hi rend="italic">namely</hi>, is also the reason why the ignorant (or illiterate) have a greater power of persuading when they are addressing a mob than the highly educated or cultivated (in dialectics and philosophy), as the poets say that the uncultivated are the more accomplished speakers in a crowd&rsquo;. </p>
						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">οἱ ποιηταί</lemma>] is generalised from one, viz. Euripides, who alone is referred to. The plural sometimes expresses the single individual <hi rend="italic">plus</hi> those like him. So we speak of &lsquo;our Newtons and our Bacons&rsquo;, <pb n="223"/> as if there were several of them, &lsquo;poets, Homers and Virgils&rsquo;; or else conveys contempt, &lsquo;don't talk to me of your Hegels and Schellings&rsquo; (from some one who was no admirer of German philosophy) and so on.

						<p>The verses here referred to, not directly quoted, are from Eur. Hippol. 989, <foreign lang="greek">οἱ γὰρ ἐν σοφοῖς φαῦλοι, παρ’  ὄχλῳ μουσικώτεροι λέγειν</foreign>. The same verses are referred to by Plutarch, de Educ. Lib. c. 9, p. 6 B. </p>
						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">μουσικός</lemma>, has here an unusual sense, which seems to be borrowed from the notion of <hi rend="italic">cultivation</hi>, literary and intellectual, which the term expresses: hence &lsquo;skilled in&rsquo;, &lsquo;highly trained or cultivated&rsquo; in the practice of a <hi rend="italic">particular</hi> art. So Rost and Palm Lex. <hi rend="italic">wohlunterrichtet, geschickt.</hi> &ldquo;Accomplished in&rdquo; seems to unite the two meanings; general cultivation, with special skill in the particular art. Ast's <hi rend="italic">Lex. Plat.</hi>, on <foreign lang="greek">μουσικῶς</foreign>: &ldquo;Et in universum <hi rend="italic">decenter.</hi> Plat. Rep. III 403 A, <foreign lang="greek">ἔρως πέφυκε ...μουσικῶς ἐρᾷν</foreign>, Legg. VII 816 C.&rdquo; </p>
						<p>&lsquo;For the one (the <foreign lang="greek">πεπαιδευμένοι</foreign>) talk about generals and universals, the others about (<hi rend="italic">lit.</hi> &lsquo;from&rsquo;, the materials <hi rend="italic">from</hi> which the speech is derived) what they really know, and things that are near to us (near, that is, to our observation, things sensible; and to our interests, those which nearly concern us)&rsquo;. The <foreign lang="greek">κοινὰ καὶ καθόλου</foreign> are the general or abstract, and universal notions, with which alone the philosopher and man of science care to deal. These are of course remote from popular knowledge and interests. The <hi rend="italic">artist</hi> also is conversant with &lsquo;generals&rsquo; and not with &lsquo;particulars or individuals&rsquo;: the rules of art are all general rules. Experience or empiricism deals with the particular: <foreign lang="greek">ἡ μὲν ἐμπειρία τῶν καθ’  ἕκαστόν ἐστι γνῶσις, ἡ δὲ τέχνη τῶν καθόλου</foreign>. Metaph. A 1, 981 <hi rend="italic">a</hi> 15. Rhet. I 2. 11, II 19. 27. But although these <hi rend="italic">abstract</hi> universal truths and rules are in themselves better known, <foreign lang="greek">καθ’  αὑτά, ἁπλῶς, τῇ φύσει γνωριμώτερα</foreign>, that is, convey a higher and more comprehensive kind of knowledge, yet <hi rend="italic">to us</hi>, <foreign lang="greek">ἡμῖν, πρὸς ἡμᾶς</foreign>, things of sense and the <hi rend="italic">concrete</hi>, the visible and palpable, are nearer or closer (<foreign lang="greek">ἐγγύς</foreign>), <hi rend="italic">clearer</hi> and more interesting, and in this sense, better known; the knowledge of these <hi rend="italic">comes to us first</hi>, as the simpler <foreign lang="greek">πρότερον</foreign>, appeals to our senses, and is consequently more in accordance with <hi rend="italic">our</hi> lower nature<note anchored="yes"><foreign lang="greek">φύσις</foreign> is used in more than one sense: thus it may be applied to the normal or abstract notion of <hi rend="italic">nature</hi>, its true and highest form, perfect nature; or an imperfect nature, as it shews itself in us and our imperfect faculties and condition.</note>. The distinction of absolute or objective, and relative or subjective, knowledge is very familiar to Aristotle. See Phys. Auscult. at the <pb n="224"/> beginning [p. 184 <hi rend="italic">a</hi> 16], <foreign lang="greek">πέφυκε δὲ ἐκ τῶν γνωριμωτέρων ἡμῖν ἡ ὁδὸς καὶ σαφεστέρων ἐπὶ τὰ σαφέστερα τῇ φύσει καὶ γνωριμώτερα· οὐ γὰρ ταὐτὰ ἡμῖν τε γνώριμα καὶ ἁπλῶς</foreign>. Metaph. Z 4, 1029 <hi rend="italic">b</hi> 1, seq. Bonitz ad loc. Waitz ad Organ. 71 <hi rend="italic">a</hi> 1, II 299, 71 <hi rend="italic">b</hi> 24, p. 307.

						<p>&lsquo;We therefore must not derive our arguments or inferences from all possible opinions&rsquo; (&ldquo;ex omnibus quae probantur, et vera esse videntur.&rdquo; Victorius); &lsquo;but select them out of those which are defined or determined or settled for us (marked off, and separated from the rest, as especially suitable to our purpose) (in some way or other) as, for instance, either by the judges (i. e. their known opinions: this in a law case) or those whose authority they accept&rsquo;. </p>
						<p>That is, there are many truths, such as scientific generalities, which may indeed be included amongst <hi rend="italic">opinions</hi> (because they are <hi rend="italic">believed</hi> as well as <hi rend="italic">known</hi>) but yet are alien to the purposes of Rhetoric, and also many opinions, properly so called, which are unfit for its use, <foreign lang="greek">οὐκ ἐξ ὧν ἔτυχεν</foreign>, I 2. 11; and besides this, &ldquo;every fool has some opinions&rdquo;, I 2. 11; we must therefore make a selection if we wish to persuade&mdash; we had been already told that though the sphere of Rhetoric, like that of Dialectics, is theoretically unlimited, I 2. 1, yet that in practice it is usually confined to the business of life and human action, and therefore that its materials are in fact drawn from Politics, including Ethics, from political and social philosophy, ib. &sect; 7. </p>
						<p>Here however there is a still further restriction&mdash;we must select out of the vast range of probable opinions those which happen to suit our immediate purpose: for instance, if we are arguing a case in a law-court we must draw our inferences from such opinions as they (the judges) themselves are known to hold, or at any rate such as those whom they regard as authorities are known to approve. <foreign lang="greek">κρίνειν</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">κριτής</foreign>, as we have seen, II 1. 2; 18. 1, may be extended to the <hi rend="italic">decision</hi> of audiences in all three branches of Rhetoric, the assembly, the judges, and the <foreign lang="greek">θεαταί</foreign> or <foreign lang="greek">θεωροί</foreign> of an epideixis, and Victorius takes this view. As however <foreign lang="greek">κρίνουσιν</foreign> is qualified by <foreign lang="greek">οἷον</foreign>, which shews that there are other analogous cases, the two audiences of indirect <foreign lang="greek">κρίνοντες</foreign> may perhaps be left to be understood. </p>
						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">τῶν δοκούντων</lemma>] &lsquo;probable opinions&rsquo;, comp. II 1. 6; 25. 2, and <foreign lang="greek">φαίνεται</foreign> in I 2. 11, and in the succeeding clause. </p>
						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">καὶ τοῦτο δέ</lemma>] &lsquo;And this too should be clear&mdash;the speaker should be quite certain&mdash;that it <hi rend="italic">does</hi> so appear to&mdash;that this <hi rend="italic">is</hi> really the opinion of&mdash;all or most (of any audience)&rsquo;.&mdash;If <foreign lang="greek">δέ</foreign> be retained (so Bekker), compare note on I 6. 22. MS A^{c} <foreign lang="greek">δή</foreign>. <hi rend="italic">Quaere</hi> <foreign lang="greek">δεῖ</foreign>? Victorius seems to understand it so, as he uses the word <hi rend="italic">debet;</hi> perhaps supposing that the notion of &lsquo;ought&rsquo; is carried on from the preceding <foreign lang="greek">λεκτέον</foreign>: and this is confirmed by the following <foreign lang="greek">συνάγειν</foreign>. <pb n="225"/> </p>
						<p>&lsquo;And his inferences should be drawn not only from necessary propositions, but also from those that are only true for the most part&rsquo;, probabilities. The <foreign lang="greek">τεκμήριον</foreign>, the certain sign, the necessary concomitant, is the only <hi rend="italic">necessary</hi> argument admitted in Rhetoric: its ordinary materials are <foreign lang="greek">εἰκότα</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">σημεῖα</foreign>, things by their very name and nature only probable. On these materials of Rhetoric, see Introd. p. 160 seq. One might suppose from the phraseology adopted here, <foreign lang="greek">μὴ μόνον ἐκ τῶν ἀναγκαίων, ἀλλὰ καὶ ἐκ τῶν ὡς ἐπὶ τὸ πολύ</foreign>, that the necessary propositions and conclusions were the rule and the probable the exception; instead of the reverse. The true statement is found in I 2. 14. Comp. Anal. Pr. I 27, 43 <hi rend="italic">b</hi> 32&mdash;36. </p>

						<p>&lsquo;So first of all it must be understood that anything we have to speak or reason about&rsquo; (on <foreign lang="greek">συλλογίζεσθαι</foreign> et sim. for reasoning in general, see note on I 1. 11), &lsquo;whether it be on a political subject or any other whatever, it is necessary to (have in our possession) be acquainted with everything that belongs to this also (<foreign lang="greek">καί</foreign> besides the <foreign lang="greek">συλλογισμός</foreign> itself, or the particular point which the argument has in view), either all or some (according to circumstances); for if you have nothing (no information, no facts) in your possession (as material) you will have nothing to draw your inferences from&rsquo;. The same thing is stated, and nearly in the same words, Anal. Pr. I 30, 46 <hi rend="italic">a</hi> 3, <foreign lang="greek">ἡ μὲν οὖν ὁδὸς κατὰ πάντων ἡ αὐτὴ καὶ περὶ φιλοσοφίαν καὶ περὶ τέχνην ὁποιανοῦν καὶ μάθημα·</foreign> (all learning and all philosophy and science begin with <hi rend="italic">observation</hi>,) <foreign lang="greek">δεῖ γὰρ τὰ ὑπάρχοντα καὶ οἷς ὑπάρχει περὶ ἑκάτερον ἀθρεῖν, καὶ τούτων ὡς πλείστων εὐπορεῖν</foreign>.

The <foreign lang="greek">ὑπάρχοντα</foreign> here spoken of are all that properly <hi rend="italic">belong</hi> to a thing, all its properties, qualities, attributes, all its antecedents and consequences&mdash;these are especially important in human actions, the rhetorician's subject&mdash;everything closely connected with it, whether similar or different, as opposites, relative terms and so on: in short, if you have to speak or reason upon any subject, if you wish to succeed, you must first know <hi rend="italic">all about it.</hi> This is illustrated at length from the three branches of Rhetoric in the next five sections. </p>

But the two things spoken of are not precisely identical, and there is a certain connexion of cause and effect between them: it is first said in general terms that the premisses upon each subject of Rhetoric have been already selected: and from this it may <hi rend="italic">in a sense</hi> be said to <hi rend="italic">follow</hi> that we are supplied <hi rend="italic">in detail</hi>, with topics for our enthymemes, with <foreign lang="greek">εἴδη</foreign> or special topics under the three branches of Rhetoric, and also for the <foreign lang="greek">ἤθη, πάθη</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">ἕξεις</foreign> in Bk. II. </p>
						<p>Vahlen, u. s. pp. 130, 1, for the reasons before mentioned (some account of his views on this subject has been given in the introductory observations on c. 18), condemns the whole of section 16, as the interpolation of an editor, who has inserted (we are not told <hi rend="italic">why</hi>) a sentence &lsquo;without motive, and disturbing&rsquo; the connexion, in which of course, following the <hi rend="italic">altered</hi> arrangement (which is assumed) he has placed the <foreign lang="greek">ἤθη</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">πάθη</foreign> immediately after the <foreign lang="greek">εἴδη</foreign> (as they now stand). </p>
						<p>Besides this he objects to <foreign lang="greek">παθημάτων</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">ἕξεων</foreign>, with which we have next to deal. <foreign lang="greek">πάθημα</foreign> in this sense for <foreign lang="greek">πάθος</foreign>, is certainly very rare, perhaps unique. But, <hi rend="italic">per contra</hi>, there are at least four passages where <foreign lang="greek">πάθημα</foreign> is found in other senses, to express which <foreign lang="greek">πάθος</foreign> is always elsewhere employed. Metaph. A 2, 982 <hi rend="italic">b</hi> 16, <foreign lang="greek">τῶν τῆς σελήνης παθημάτων</foreign>, and c. 4, 985 <hi rend="italic">b</hi> 12, <foreign lang="greek">τὡν παθημάτων</foreign> (<foreign lang="greek">τῆς ὑποκειμένης οὐσίας</foreign>): Anal. Post. I 10, 76 <hi rend="italic">b</hi> 13, <foreign lang="greek">τῶν καθ’  αὑτὰ παθημάτων</foreign>, and Anal. Pr. II 27, 70 <hi rend="italic">b</hi> 9 <foreign lang="greek">ὅσα φυσικά ἐστι παθήματα</foreign>: which certainly seem to be sufficient to justify <foreign lang="greek">παθημάτων</foreign> here<note anchored="yes">[Bonitz (<hi rend="italic">Aristotelische Studien</hi> V 50, and <hi rend="italic">Index Aristotelicus</hi>) holds that in Aristotle there is no clear distinction of meaning between <foreign lang="greek">πάθημα</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">πάθος</foreign>, &ldquo;sed eadem fere vi et sensus varietate utrumque nomen, saepius alterum, alterum rarius usurpari.&rdquo; In the Aristotelian writings, <foreign lang="greek">πάθημα</foreign> is never found in the sing. except in the spurious <hi rend="italic">Physiognomonica</hi> 806 <hi rend="italic">a</hi> 2; the gen. pl. <foreign lang="greek">παθημάτων</foreign> occurs 38 times, <foreign lang="greek">παθῶν</foreign> only 8. (Note Eth. Eudem. B, 2, 1220 <hi rend="italic">b</hi> 6, <foreign lang="greek">λεκτέον δὴ κατὰ τί τῆς ψυχῆς ποῖ̓ ἄττα ἤθη. ἔσται δὲ κατά τε τὰς δυνάμεις τῶν παθημάτων, καθ̓ ἃς ὡς παθητικοὶ λέγονται, καὶ κατὰ τὰς ἕξεις, καθ̓ ἃς πρὸς τὰ πάθη ταῦτα λέγονται τῷ πάσχειν πῶς ἢ ἀπαθεῖς εἶναι. μετὰ ταῦτα ἡ διαίρεσις ἐν τοῖς ἀπηλλαγμένοις</foreign> (?) <foreign lang="greek">τῶν παθημάτων καὶ τῶν δυναμέων καὶ τῶν ἕξεων. λέγω δὲ πάθη μὲν τὰ τοιαῦτα, θυμὸν φόβον αἰδῶ ἐπιθυμίαν</foreign>.) Bernays, while admitting that the words are often used loosely, draws the following distinction: <foreign lang="greek">πάθος</foreign> <hi rend="italic">ist der Zustand eines</hi> <foreign lang="greek">πάσχων</foreign> <hi rend="italic">und bezeichnet den unerwartet ausbrechenden und vor&uuml;bergehendenden Affect;</hi> <foreign lang="greek">πάθημα</foreign> <hi rend="italic">dagegen ist der Zustand eines</hi> <foreign lang="greek">παθητικὸς</foreign> <hi rend="italic">und bezeichnet den Affect also inh&auml;rirend der afficirten Person und als jederzeit zum Ausbruche reif. K&uuml;rzer gesagt</hi>, <foreign lang="greek">πάθος</foreign> <hi rend="italic">ist der Affect und</hi> <foreign lang="greek">πάθημα</foreign> <hi rend="italic">ist die Affection</hi> (Aristoteles &uuml;ber Wirkung der Trag&ouml;die, Abhhandl. der hist. phil. Gesellschaft in Breslau, I. pp. 149, 194&mdash;6). The distinction is insisted on in a treatise by H. Baumgart, <hi rend="italic">Pathos und Pathema im Aristotelischen Sprachgebrauch</hi>, K&ouml;nigsberg, 1873, pp. 58.]</note>. <pb n="235"/> </p>
						<p>As to <foreign lang="greek">ἕξεων</foreign>, this, through a deviation from the author's usual phraseology, who generally confines himself to <foreign lang="greek">ἤθη</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">πάθη</foreign>, appears again in this connexion, II 12 init., <foreign lang="greek">τὰ δ’  ἤθη ποῖοί τινες κατὰ τὰ πάθη καὶ τὰς ἕξεις κ.τ.λ.</foreign> The author there himself tells us his meaning, interpreting <foreign lang="greek">ἕξεις</foreign> by <foreign lang="greek">ἀρετὰς καὶ κακίας</foreign>; and I can see no reason for condemning the word, as Vahlen does, except the very insufficient one, that it is unusual<note anchored="yes">I have noticed in many recent German commentators on Aristotle, Brandis being an honourable exception, a disposition to pin down their author to a fixed and particular mode of expression in certain cases from which he is never to be allowed to deviate. Aristotle is the very last writer to whom any such rule should be applied. He is always hasty, often careless; and, as we have seen in so many instances in this work, is very apt to use words in senses either vague and indeterminate, or (properly) inapplicable, or unusual; and his style is loose and careless to a fault, both in construction and expression. He is a writer who more than all others requires a most liberal allowance for irregularities.</note>. The <foreign lang="greek">ἕξεις</foreign> in this sense, do actually enter into, and in fact constitute the <foreign lang="greek">ἦθος</foreign>, and I do not see why they should not be specially mentioned, if Aristotle chose to depart from his ordinary practice, and do so. </p>
						<p>So far then we have been occupied with the <foreign lang="greek">εἴδη</foreign>, special subjects derived from special sciences, and specially employed each in one of the three departments of Rhetoric&mdash;this is generally, not absolutely true; for though the three ends of Rhetoric, the good or useful, the just, and the noble or right, are more appropriate and more serviceable, each in <hi rend="italic">one</hi> of the three branches, yet any of them can be, and sometimes is, introduced in them all&mdash;and we must now turn to the topics, the families, classes, of arguments into which enthymemes in <hi rend="italic">general</hi> may be made to fall. This is for convenience of practice, that we may know where to look for them when we want them, and apply that which happens to be appropriate to the particular case. This classification is made in the 23rd chapter, which therefore is the <hi rend="italic">rhetorical</hi> representative of the far more extensive and minute classification of <hi rend="italic">dialectical</hi> topics, and is the object also of Cicero's Topica. And as the treatise on fallacies, the book <foreign lang="greek">περὶ σοφιστικῶν ἐλέγχων</foreign>, is appended to the books of the Topics, so we have a similar chapter on rhetorical fallacies (c. 24) added to the analysis of the genuine arguments. </p>
						<p>I will here remark (against Vahlen) that the word <foreign lang="greek">καθόλου</foreign> &sect; 17, which contrasts these universal <foreign lang="greek">τόποι</foreign> with the special topics that have preceded, renders the actual mention of them in the foregoing section almost, if not quite, necessary. </p>
					</div3>
					<div3 id="b2c22s17" type="section" n="17">
						<p>&lsquo;Let us now proceed further in another way to take (or find) <pb n="236"/> universal topics about every thing (taken promiscuously, that is, from any of the <foreign lang="greek">εἴδη</foreign>, and applied indifferently to any of the three branches of Rhetoric), and add a supplementary note upon the refutative and demonstrative (<hi rend="italic">subaudi</hi> <foreign lang="greek">τόπους ἐνθυμημάτων</foreign>) topics of enthymemes (the contents of c. 23), and those of apparent&rsquo; (shams, impostors, not genuine), &lsquo;not real, enthymemes; not real, because this is likewise the case with syllogisms (of which enthymemes though mutilated are a copy, and therefore share with the others the fallacious kind)&rsquo;. </p>
						<p>The literal translation of <foreign lang="greek">οὐκ ὄντων δὲ ἐνθυμημάτων, ἐπεί περ οὐδὲ συλλογισμῶν</foreign> is, &ldquo;enthymemes not real, because there are also unreal (not-real syllogisms&rdquo;; <foreign lang="greek">οὐδέ</foreign>, neither, being broken up into two parts, of which the <foreign lang="greek">δέ</foreign> contrasts <foreign lang="greek">συλλογισμῶν</foreign> with <foreign lang="greek">ἐνθυμημάτων</foreign>, and the <foreign lang="greek">οὐ</foreign> negatives the <hi rend="italic">genuineness</hi> (und. from the preceding) of the syllogism, not the syllogism itself. </p>
						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">παρασημαινόμενοι</lemma>] is a very oddly chosen word to express the treatment of chapters 23 and 24, which are just as much connected with the subject of the work, and treated with as much care and detail, as the rest. It means according to Victorius (and Rost and Palm's <hi rend="italic">Lex.</hi>) <hi rend="italic">adscribere, adnotare</hi>, applied to something of subordinate interest and importance, or not immediately and closely connected with the subject in hand, as a <hi rend="italic">note</hi> on the margin of a manuscript; &lsquo;noting beside&rsquo; the main subject, <hi rend="italic">a supplementary note.</hi> This is certainly the meaning of it in Top. A 14, 105 <hi rend="italic">b</hi> 16, where it is applied to the &lsquo;noting down&rsquo; of the opinions of individual philosophers, &lsquo;beside&rsquo;, as supplementary to, those which are generally accepted: and also, as Victorius thinks, of <foreign lang="greek">παράσημα</foreign> in de Soph. El. 20, 177 <hi rend="italic">b</hi> 6&mdash;this is not quite so certain: [<foreign lang="greek">ἐν τοῖς γεγραμμένοις παράσημα ποιοῦνται</foreign> (signa ponunt ad vocabula distinguenda), <hi rend="italic">Index Aristotelicus</hi>]. Alexander Aphrodisiensis in his commentary on the former passage adds <foreign lang="greek">παραγράφειν</foreign>, apparently as a synonym, or interpretation of the other. </p>
						<p>&lsquo;And after this has been made clear, let us pass on to the determination of solutions and objections, whence they must be brought, from what sources derived, for the refutation of enthymemes&rsquo;. Of <foreign lang="greek">λύσις</foreign> and its two modes, <foreign lang="greek">ἔλεγχος</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">ἔνστασις</foreign>, the contents of c. 25, see Introd. 268 seq. </p>

					<p>In an excellent <hi rend="italic">Review of the study of ancient Rhetoric</hi> [by Spengel], read at the celebration of the eighty-third anniversary of the foundation <pb n="237"/> of the Munich Academy of Sciences, 1842, a clear account is given of the relation of these <foreign lang="greek">τόποι ἐνθυμημάτων</foreign> that follow to the <foreign lang="greek">εἴδη</foreign> of the first book, of which I will give a translation with very slight alterations. </p>
					<p>To the first of these he gives the name of &lsquo;formal&rsquo;, to the second of &lsquo;material&rsquo; proofs. &ldquo;Formal proofs, such as they appear in Dialectics and Rhetoric, are of an universal nature, and therefore applicable alike to all branches of science; they form the collective Topics, which Aristotle has elaborated for Dialectics with wonderful completeness in the most comprehensive of all the works of his Organon; whilst in Rhetoric, not without reference to the other, he has selected and put forward only what is most essential. Material proofs are with him such as are derived from the principles of the special sciences, the knowledge of which the orator must bring with him, ready for any occasion on which it may be properly applied. Aristotle is by no means of opinion that a mere superficial description, without thorough knowledge of the object to be described, and alien to the true spirit of it, can be called &lsquo;rhetorical&rsquo; with propriety; on the contrary, the orator must be thoroughly imbued with the knowledge of his subject, whatever department of knowledge it may happen to belong to, and from this special science bring with him his concrete proofs, for the purpose of convincing. Accordingly, for forensic pleading the accurate study of law is indispensable, for the deliberative speaking or counselling that of Politics, the science of government, and similarly for each kind the special knowledge which belongs to it. But this special knowledge cannot be obtained from Rhetoric itself, otherwise it would carry in itself all knowledge, which is not the case: the office of Rhetoric is, to work up the proofs which the special science offers, to combine them with the &lsquo;formal&rsquo;, and so to bring the subject within the reach of universal comprehension.&rdquo; </p>
					<p>On the contents of this chapter, and its connexion with the Topics, Brandis, ap. Schneidewin's <hi rend="italic">Philologus</hi> [IV i.] p. 18, has the following remarks. &ldquo;We now turn (c. 23) to the universal points of view (topics) most worthy of attention for the formation or refutation of enthymemes, which are briefly discussed. Before passing to this, Aristotle has already pointed out the connexion which exists between this division of the Rhetoric and the Topics (c. 22 &sect; 10). It is perfectly conceivable however that here also (as before, referring to Rhet. I 7,) what in the Topics has met with a detailed discussion in regard of the various modes of applying them, is here only briefly referred to, and with an exclusive view to the application to be made of them in speaking.&rdquo; He then illustrates this at some length from the two works; but it will be more convenient to leave these details till we come to them in the course of the notes on the topics themselves. [On the Topics, see in general Grote's <hi rend="italic">Aristotle</hi>, ch. IX.] </p>
					<p>Cicero, Topica, first gives a summary classification of the various forms of these arguments under their most general heads, III 11. These are, <hi rend="italic">coniugata, ex genere, ex forma, ex similitudine, ex differentia, ex contrario, ex adiunctis, ex antecedentibus, ex consequentibus, ex repugnantibus, ex caussis, ex effectis, ex comparatione maiorum aut parium aut minorum</hi>, (the last, <hi rend="italic">comp. maiorum et minorum</hi>, are the topics of Rhet. I 7,) which are afterwards described in greater detail and illustrated, cc. IX 38,&mdash;XVIII 71, <hi rend="italic">Haec ego argumenta, quae transferri in multas causas</hi> <pb n="238"/> <hi rend="italic">possunt, locos communes nominamus</hi>, de Inv. II 15. 48. Quintilian treats them, Inst. Orat. V 10, 20&mdash;94, and sums them up thus, &sect; 94; <hi rend="italic">Ergo ut breviter contraham summam, ducuntur argumenta a</hi> personis, causis, locis, tempore (<hi rend="italic">cuius tres partes diximus</hi>, praecedens, coniunctum, insequens), facultatibus (<hi rend="italic">quibus</hi> instrumentum <hi rend="italic">subiecimus</hi>), modo (<hi rend="italic">id est ut quidque sit factum</hi>), finitione, genere, specie, differentibus, propriis, remotione, divisione, initio, incrementis, summa, similibus, dissimilibus, pugnantibus, consequentibus, efficientibus, effectis, eventis, iugatis, comparatione, <hi rend="italic">quae in plures diducitur species. Iugata</hi> are Cicero's <hi rend="italic">coniugata</hi>, Aristotle's <foreign lang="greek">σύστοιχα</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">ὅμοιαι πτώσεις</foreign>. </p>
					<p>These arguments can <hi rend="italic">all</hi>(<hi rend="italic">?</hi>) be turned both ways, and applied to prove either the affirmative <foreign lang="greek">δεικτικά, κατασκευαστικά</foreign>, constructive, confirmatory; or the negative, <foreign lang="greek">ἐλεγκτικά</foreign>, (23. 30); <foreign lang="greek">ἀνασκευάζειν, ἀναιρεῖν</foreign>; destructive of the proposition maintained by the theorist (in philosophy), the opponent (in dialectics). Rhetoric <foreign lang="greek">τἀναντία συλλογίζεται</foreign> [I 1. 12]. Of the first, <foreign lang="greek">ἐκ τῶν ἐναντίων</foreign>, this is expressly stated. </p>
					<div3 id="b2c23s1" type="section" n="1">
						<p>One class of demonstrative (or affirmative) enthymemes is derived from <hi rend="italic">opposites:</hi> we have to consider, namely, whether the opposite (to the one) belongs to (i. e. can be said, or predicated of) the opposite (to the other). Two pairs of opposites are supposed, as in the example, temperance and licentiousness, good, i. e. profitable, and injurious: the question is whether the two opposed terms or things stand in the same relation to one another, i. e. that one can be predicated of the other, as the two first, to which they <hi rend="italic">are</hi> opposed: if they can, the original proposition may be maintained, or inferred by the enthymeme; if not, it can be confuted or destroyed. The inference in either case is drawn <foreign lang="greek">ἐκ τῶν ἐναντίων</foreign>, from the correctness or incorrectness, the truth or falsehood, of the assertion of compatibility or coexistence in the opposites, or that one <hi rend="italic">can</hi> be predicated of the other. Thus in the example, if the opposites to the original proposition&mdash;temperance is profitable&mdash; stand in the same relation to one another as the two members of the first, so that the one can be truly predicated of the other&mdash;if the opposite, injurious, is truly predicable of licentiousness&mdash;then, so far, we infer the truth of the first: if not, the proposition may be confuted. The inference, like all other rhetorical inferences, is <hi rend="italic">probable</hi>, not necessary: it can always be contradicted. </p>
						<p>Aristotle, as we have already seen (note on c. 19. 1), distinguishes four kinds of <foreign lang="greek">ἀντικείμενα</foreign>, or opposites; contradictory, contrary (extremes under the same genus, as here <foreign lang="greek">σωφροσύνη</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">ἀκολασία</foreign> are the two extremes, virtue and vice, under the genus <foreign lang="greek">ἦθος</foreign>, moral character), relative, and <foreign lang="greek">ἕξις</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">στέρησις</foreign>, state and privation. In the Topics all the four kinds in their relation to this form of argument are successively handled; in the Rhetoric, the treatment is confined to the single kind of contraries, as the most useful and plausible, and the rest passed over. See Brandis, u. s., p. 18. The passage in the Topics corresponding to this is B 8, 113 <hi rend="italic">b</hi> 27, seq. [Grote's <hi rend="italic">Ar.</hi> I, chap. IX pp. 422, 3]; but compare also B 2, 109 <hi rend="italic">b</hi> 17; on the import and limitations of <foreign lang="greek">ἐναντίον</foreign> Ib. c. 7; <foreign lang="greek">Γ</foreign> 6, init. on the great advantages and wide extent of these two first topics, viz. this, and the next, <pb n="239"/> <foreign lang="greek">τῶν συστοίχων καὶ τῶν πτώσεων. ὁμοίως γὰρ ἔνδοξον τὸ ἀξιῶσαι, εἰ πᾶσα ἡδονὴ ἀγαθόν, καὶ λύπην πᾶσαν εἶναι κακόν κ.τ.λ.</foreign> followed by a series of illustrations: also B 9, 114 <hi rend="italic">b</hi> 6. The treatment of opposites in the Topics and Rhetoric corresponds in this, that in both works it has reference solely to the art of reasoning, to the inferences affirmative or negative that may be drawn by constructive, or refutative, syllogisms and enthymemes. </p>
						<p>Cicero (who borrows a good deal from Aristotle), Topic. XI. 47, <hi rend="italic">Deinceps locus est, qui a contrario dicitur. Contrariorum autem genera sunt plura: unum eorum quae in eodem genere plurimum differunt</hi> (Arist.), <hi rend="italic">ut sapientia et stultitia....Haec quae ex eodem genere contraria sunt appellantur adversa.</hi> His instance is, <hi rend="italic">si stultitiam fugimus, sapientiam sequamur</hi> (this in the Aristotelian form would be, If folly is to be shunned, wisdom is to be sought or pursued). He then goes through the three remaining kinds of <hi rend="italic">contraria</hi>, following Aristotle. </p>
						<p><hi rend="italic">Ex contrariis, Frugalitas bonum, luxuria</hi> enim <hi rend="italic">malum</hi> (enthym.). <hi rend="italic">Si malorum causa bellum est, erit emendatio pax: si veniam meretur qui imprudens nocuit, non meretur praemium qui imprudens profuit.</hi> Quint. V 10. 73. In the last example, the opposites are, excuse, indulgence (for a fault), and reward (for a service), injury and benefit: the merit or <hi rend="italic">desert</hi> is common to both: only in the one case it takes the form of demerit, which <hi rend="italic">deserves</hi> punishment: as is also the absence of purpose, of good or ill intention. </p>
						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ἀναιρεῖν</lemma>, &lsquo;to take up&rsquo;, passes on to the sense of removing, taking away; thence to <hi rend="italic">taking off</hi>, destroying; and so finally, when it comes to logic, is applied to the argument which upsets, subverts, destroys, or refutes the adversary's argument or position. </p>
						<p>&lsquo;Or (a second example) as it is in the Messeniac speech (of Alcidamas, on which see note on I 13. 2), &ldquo;for if it is the war which is the cause of the present evils, it is by <hi rend="italic">the</hi> peace (which I now propose) that they must be rectified.&rdquo; <foreign lang="greek">συμβουλεύει ὁ Ἀλκιδάμας τοῖς Λακεδαιμονίοις μὴ καταδουλῶσαι τοὺς ἐν Μεσσήνῃ, ἐπιχειρῶν ἐκ τοῦ ἐναντίου. Εἰ γὰρ ὁ</foreign> <pb n="240"/> <foreign lang="greek">πόλεμος, φησί, προυξένησε τάδε τὰ κακά, εἰρήνη πάλιν ταῦτα ἐπανορθώσεται</foreign> (Scholiast). &lsquo;Verba ipsa Alcidamantis scholiastes videtur conservasse.&rdquo; Sauppe ad Alcid. Fragm. Messen. 2. <hi rend="italic">Oratores Attici</hi>, III 154. Quintilian has borrowed this, see above [middle of p. 239]. </p>
						<p>&ldquo;The four lines which follow as a third example are of uncertain authorship: Gaisford attributes them either to Agathon or Theodectes: the enthymeme <hi rend="italic">ex contrario</hi> that it contains would suit either of them, since they both cultivated Rhetoric as well as the dramatic art (Wagner <hi rend="italic">Trag. Gr. Fragm.</hi> III 185). To avoid the conjunction of <foreign lang="greek">εἰ</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">οὐ</foreign>, Elmsley, ad Med. 87, proposes <foreign lang="greek">ἐπεί</foreign>. Reisig, <hi rend="italic">Coniect.</hi> I p. 113 (ap. Pflugk), justly replies that <foreign lang="greek">εἴπερ</foreign> is equivalent to <foreign lang="greek">ἐπεί</foreign>, and therefore admits the same construction. On <foreign lang="greek">εἰ</foreign> with <foreign lang="greek">ἄν</foreign> and the optative, see Appendix (on II 20 &sect; 5) at the end of this book; and on <foreign lang="greek">εἰ</foreign> followed by <foreign lang="greek">οὐ</foreign>, see Appendix C, Vol. I p. 301. For <foreign lang="greek">οὐδ ἄν</foreign>, Wagner proposes either <foreign lang="greek">ἤν</foreign> or <foreign lang="greek">ἅν</foreign>. </p>
						<p>Cicero, de Inv. I XXX 46, has adopted this: <hi rend="italic">In contrariis hoc modo; nam si iis qui imprudentes laeserunt ignosci convenit, iis qui necessario profuerunt haberi gratiam non oportet</hi>, and Quintilian, V 10. 73, (above). </p>
						<p>The second quotation (example 4), is from Euripides' Thyestes, Fragm. VII (Wagner). This we learn from the Scholiast, quoted in Wagner's note. Matthiae refers to the similar paradox in Agathon's couplet, Rhet. II 24. 10. </p>

						<p>Top. II. <foreign lang="greek">ἐκ τῶν ὁμοίων, πτώσεων</foreign>] On <foreign lang="greek">πτώσεις</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">σύστοιχα</foreign>, see note on I 7. 27. <foreign lang="greek">πτῶσις</foreign> &ldquo;<hi rend="italic">grammatische abbiegung</hi>,&rdquo; Brandis [<hi rend="italic">Philol.</hi> IV i]. &lsquo;Another (inference may be drawn) from similar inflexions; for the inflected words (or, the inflexions of the word) must be capable of similar predication, (for instance from <foreign lang="greek">δίκη</foreign> by inflexion, or variation of termination, are formed the <foreign lang="greek">πτώσεις, δίκαιος, δικαίως</foreign>&mdash;as well as the grammatical <hi rend="italic">cases, inflexion and declension</hi>, and if <foreign lang="greek">δίκαιον</foreign> can be predicated of anything, then <foreign lang="greek">δικαίως</foreign> must be predicable of the same). We may therefore argue, says the example, &lsquo;that justice is not all good&rsquo;, taking the negative side, <foreign lang="greek">μὴ ὑπάρχειν</foreign>, good is not universally predicable of justice; otherwise good would be predicable of the <foreign lang="greek">πτῶσις, δικαίως</foreign>, which is not true in all cases; &lsquo;for all good is <foreign lang="greek">αἱρετόν</foreign>, an object of choice; but a just punishment, or to be <hi rend="italic">justly</hi> punished, everybody would allow not to be desirable&rsquo;. This is an application of the topic to its negative, destructive, or refutative use: the inference is that the rule laid down is not true. Compare with this example, I 9. 15, where the same distinction is made: although <foreign lang="greek">τὰ δίκαια</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">δικαίως ἔργα</foreign> are similarly predicable, yet this is not the case with the <foreign lang="greek">πάθη</foreign>: <foreign lang="greek">ἐν μόνῃ γὰρ</foreign> (this is therefore an exceptional case to which the ordinary rule of <foreign lang="greek">ὅμοιαι πτώσεις</foreign> does not apply) <foreign lang="greek">ταύτῃ τῶν ἀρετῶν οὐκ ἀεὶ τὸ δικαίως καλόν, ἀλλ’  ἐπὶ τοῦ ζημιοῦσθαι αἰσχρὸν τὸ δικαίως μᾶλλον ἢ τὸ ἀδίκως</foreign>. </p>
						<p>Brandis u. s. notes on this topic another difference which shews itself between the Topics and the Rhetoric, that whereas in the former the <foreign lang="greek">σύστοιχα</foreign> are usually (not always) added to the <foreign lang="greek">πτώσεις</foreign> in the treatment of it, they are here omitted, and the grammatical form of co-ordinates alone taken into account. <pb n="241"/> </p>
						<p>The use of the topic as a dialectical argument is abundantly illustrated in the Topics, in very many places, as may be seen by consulting Waitz's Index ad Organon, s. v. The principal passage on the subject is Top. B 9,&mdash;where the <foreign lang="greek">πτώσεις</foreign>, the <hi rend="italic">grammatical</hi> co-ordinates, are properly subordinated to the more extensive <foreign lang="greek">σύστοιχα</foreign>, things which are <hi rend="italic">logically</hi> co-ordinate, 114 <hi rend="italic">b</hi> 34. The latter are exemplified by <foreign lang="greek">δικαιοσύνη, δίκαιος, δίκαιον, δικαίως</foreign>. Compare A 15, 106 <hi rend="italic">b</hi> 29, on the application of them to ambiguous terms, <foreign lang="greek">πλεοναχῶς λεγόμενα</foreign>, also <foreign lang="greek">Γ</foreign> 3, 118 <hi rend="italic">a</hi> 34, <foreign lang="greek">Δ</foreign> 3, 124 <hi rend="italic">a</hi> 10, and the rest, which indicate their various applications<note anchored="yes">If I am not mistaken <foreign lang="greek">ὅμοιαι πτώσεις</foreign> is a misnomer. If <foreign lang="greek">πτώσεις</foreign> are the various inflexions&mdash;declensions in an extended sense&mdash;of a root-word, the term must be confined to the changes of the <hi rend="italic">terminations:</hi> in these appears, not <hi rend="italic">similarity</hi>, but <hi rend="italic">difference:</hi> the similarity lies, not in the terminations, but in the idea or root common to all the varieties: &lsquo;similar&rsquo; therefore, though it may very well be predicated of the <foreign lang="greek">σύστοιχα</foreign>, is not properly applied to <foreign lang="greek">πτώσεις</foreign>.</note>. </p>
						<p>Cicero, Top. IV 12, comp. IX 38, illustrates <hi rend="italic">coniugata</hi>, which is his name for Ar.'s <foreign lang="greek">πτώσεις</foreign>, by <hi rend="italic">sapiens, sapienter, sapientia;</hi> and the argument from it by, <hi rend="italic">Si compascuus ager est, ius est compascere. Haec verborum coniugatio</hi>, he says, <foreign lang="greek">συζυγία</foreign> <hi rend="italic">dicitur:</hi> on which Spengel (<hi rend="italic">Specim. Comm. in Ar.

						<p>Quintilian, who treats the topic with some contempt as hardly deserving of notice, has, Inst. Orat.

						<p>This topic has occurred before, II 19. 12, as one of the topics of &lsquo;the possible&rsquo;: where the parallel passages of Cic. Topic. XI 49, and de Inv. I 30. 47, will be found in the note. On the same, Quintilian, Inst. Or. V 10. 78, <hi rend="italic">Illa quoque quae</hi> ex rebus mutuam confirmationem praestantibus <hi rend="italic">ducuntur</hi> (<hi rend="italic">quae proprii generis videri quidam volunt, et vocant</hi> <foreign lang="greek">ἐκ τῶν πρὸς ἄλληλα</foreign>, <hi rend="italic">Cicero</hi> ex rebus sub eandem rationem venientibus) <hi rend="italic">fortiter consequentibus iunxerim</hi> (I should be bold to add to <hi rend="italic">consequents</hi>): <hi rend="italic">si portorium Rhodiis</hi> locare <hi rend="italic">honestum est et Hermocreonti</hi> conducere<hi rend="italic">; et quod</hi> discere <hi rend="italic">honestum, et</hi> docere (from de Inventione, u. s.). The argument is, &lsquo;If it may be said of one (of the two terms of the relation) that he has <hi rend="italic">done</hi> rightly or justly, then the same terms may be applied to what the other has <hi rend="italic">suffered</hi> (<foreign lang="greek">ποιεῖν</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">πάσχειν</foreign>, agent and patient, are relative opposites<note anchored="yes">The relation of <foreign lang="greek">ποιεῖν</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">πάσχειν</foreign>, agent and patient, action and passion, is well illustrated in the argument between Polus and Socrates, Plat. Gorg. c. 32, 476 B, seq. It is there shewn by analogy&mdash;the usual Socratic and Platonic method&mdash;that the relation between the two prevails throughout its various applications, and <hi rend="italic">therefore</hi> that crime and punishment follow the same law, and that justice or desert in the punishment of the criminal or patient implies the like justice in the infliction of it by the agent, and <hi rend="italic">vice versa.</hi></note>); and similarly (<foreign lang="greek">κελεύειν</foreign> is relative to <foreign lang="greek">πείθεσθαι</foreign>) command implies obedience, and the converse (this may be <hi rend="italic">inferred</hi> as the ordinary, probable, not a necessary consequence): as Diomedon the taxcollector argued about the taxes (i. e. the <hi rend="italic">farming</hi> of them) &ldquo;If it is no disgrace to you to <hi rend="italic">sell</hi>, neither is it to us to <hi rend="italic">buy.</hi>&rdquo; </p>
						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">οἷον ὡς</lemma>] This pleonasm occurs again in &sect; 6, <foreign lang="greek">οἷον ὡς Ἰφικράτης</foreign>. </p>
						<p>Of Diomedon, nothing is known but what we learn from the passage. </p>
						<p>&lsquo;And if the terms fairly or justly can be applied to the sufferer, then also to the doer (or perpetrator) of the act; and conversely, if to the doer then also to the sufferer&rsquo;. If there be any difference between this and the preceding, <foreign lang="greek">εἰ γὰρ θατέρῳπεπονθέναι</foreign>, it is that the first is the general expression of the relation between agent and patient, the second is a particular exemplification of it, in the justification of what would otherwise be a crime. </p>
						<p>&lsquo;But this admits of a fallacy: for though it may be true (in general, or in itself) that deserved suffering involves the justice of the punish<pb n="243"/> ment, yet perhaps (it does not always follow that) <hi rend="italic">you</hi> should be the agent of it, that the punishment should be inflicted by <hi rend="italic">you</hi> (any particular individual)&rsquo;. This fallacy is actually illustrated from Theodectes' Orestes, <hi rend="italic">infra</hi> c. 24 &sect; 3. The argument is used by Orestes in his trial for the murder of his mother Clytemnestra. In the trial scene of the Eumenides this point is taken into consideration, and the act of Orestes justified by Apollo and Athena on the general ground of the superiority of male to female; the father, the author of his existence, has a higher claim upon the son's affection and duty than the mother, and Orestes was right in avenging his father's death even upon her. Aesch. Eumen. 625 seq., 657 seq., 738&mdash;40. Comp. Eur. Orest. 528, where Tyndareus, Clytemnestra's father, says, <foreign lang="greek">θυγατὴρ δ’  ἐμὴ θανοῦς̓ ἔπραξεν ἔνδικα· ἀλλ̓ οὐχὶ πρὸς τοῦδ̓ εἰκὸς ἦν αὐτὴν θανεῖν</foreign>: and Orestes, <hi rend="italic">ib.</hi> 546, defends himself on the same grounds as in Aeschylus, <foreign lang="greek">ἐγὼ δ’  ἀνόσιός εἰμι μητέρα κτανών, ὅσιος δέ γ̓ ἕτερον ὄνομα, τιμωρῶν πατρί. 552, πατὴρ μὲν ἐφύτευσεν με κ.τ.λ. 562, ἐπὶ δ̓ ἔθυσα μητέρα, ἀνόσια μὲν δρῶν ἀλλὰ τιμωρῶν πατρί</foreign>. Electr. 1244, (quoted by Victorius on <foreign lang="greek">φησὶ δ’  ἀποκρινόμενοσκτανεῖν</foreign>,) the Dioscuri to Orestes, <foreign lang="greek">δίκαια μέν νυν ἥδ’  ἔχει· σὺ δ̓ οὐχὶ δρᾷς</foreign>. The case of Orestes and Clytemnestra became one of the stock examples in the rhetorical books. Auct. ad Heren. I 10. 17, I 15. 25, 16. 26. Cic. de Inv. I 13. 18, 22. 31. Quint. Inst. Or. III 11. 4, and 11 seq., VII 4. 8. </p>
						<p>&lsquo;And therefore a separate investigation is required, not only whether the sufferer deserved to suffer, but also whether the doer had a right to do it (as, to inflict the punishment), and then make the appropriate use of either: because sometimes there is a difference in cases of this kind (i. e. both kinds of right are not always found together: the punishment may be just, but <hi rend="italic">you</hi> may not be the proper person to inflict it), and there is nothing to prevent (the case being) as it is put in Theodectes&rsquo; Alcmaeon (where this &lsquo;division&rsquo;, <foreign lang="greek">διαλαβόντα</foreign>, is actually made): &ldquo;And did no mortal abhor thy mother?&rdquo; This is a question put to Alcmaeon, probably by Alphesiboea (Victorius), whose reply includes the words actually quoted, <foreign lang="greek">ἀλλὰ διαλαβόντα χρὴ σκοπεῖν</foreign>, with, of course, a good deal more about the murder which is omitted. &lsquo;To which (Alcmaeon) says in reply &ldquo;nay but we must first distinguish, and <hi rend="italic">then</hi> consider the case.&rdquo;&rsquo; (The <hi rend="italic">division</hi> or <hi rend="italic">distinction</hi> here spoken of is well illustrated by the parallel passage, the case of Orestes, II 24. 3.) &lsquo;And when Alphesiboea asks &ldquo;How?&rdquo;, he replies, &ldquo;To her they adjudged death, (i. e. decided that she was justly slain,) but (decided also) that <hi rend="italic">I</hi> should not have been the murderer.&rdquo;&rsquo; From this reply it may be gathered that the judges in Theodoctes' play had made the requisite distinction: the death of Eriphyle they agreed was deserved, but it was not for her son to inflict the penalty. &ldquo;Alcmaeon Eriphylen matrem suam interfecerat, quod haec Amphiarai mariti salutem prodiderat&rdquo; (Alcmaeon's act, like that of <pb n="244"/> Orestes, was justified by the implied murder of his father&mdash;the treachery which caused his death). &ldquo;Alphesiboea fuit Alcmaeonis uxor.&rdquo; Schrader. This fragment is quoted by Wagner, Theodect. Fragm. Alcm. I, but without a word of commentary, III 118. </p>
						<p>On Theodectes of Phaselis, the rhetorician and dramatic poet, the friend of Aristotle, who frequently refers to his compositions in both kinds, and on the rhetorical character of his writings, which is well illustrated here and in II 24. 3, see M&uuml;ller, <hi rend="italic">Hist. Gr. Lit.</hi> ch. XXVI &sect; 7, who refers to these passages. Also, <hi rend="italic">Camb. Journ. of Cl. and Sacred Phil.</hi> No. IX Vol. III p. 260 seq.<note anchored="yes">The unwarrantable identification, there supposed, p. 261, of the Theodectea with the <foreign lang="greek">rητορικὴ πρὸς Ἀλέξανδρον</foreign>, has been sufficiently corrected in Introd. to Rhet. pp. 55&mdash;67, on the Theodectea; where more information will be found about the author and his works.</note> To the passages there quoted on this author, add Theopomp. Hist. Phil. Lib. I, Fr. 26, ap. Fragm. Hist. Gr. (Didot) p. 282; and a ref. to his Philoctetes, Eth. Nic. VII 8, 1150 <hi rend="italic">b</hi> 9. </p>
						<p>Two other examples follow, but, as Spengel (<hi rend="italic">Tract on the Rhet.</hi> in <hi rend="italic">Trans. Bav. Acad.</hi>, Munich 1851, p. 46) justly says, they have no connexion with the preceding example from Theodectes, and the division which it exemplifies, but are illustrations of the general topic. Retaining the text (with Bekker) as it stands, we must accordingly understand the words <foreign lang="greek">ἔστι δ’  ἐν τούτῳμὴ κτανεῖν</foreign> as parenthetical, and suppose that the author, after the insertion of this as a <hi rend="italic">note</hi>, proceeds with his exemplification of the general topic. Spengel, u. s., p. 47, suggests that they may have been a later addition by the author himself, a note written on the margin, which has got out of its place. My supposition, of a note, <hi rend="italic">not</hi> written on the margin, but embodied in the text as a parenthesis&mdash;which is quite in Ar.'s manner&mdash;will answer the purpose equally well, and save the text in addition. </p>
						<p>&lsquo;And, another example, the trial of Demosthenes and those who slew Nicanor; for as they were adjudged to have slain him justly (the act), it was held that his death (the passion or suffering) was just&rsquo;. This is cited by Dion. Halicarn., Ep. I ad Amm. c. 12, as a proof that Aristotle was acquainted with and quoted the speeches of Demosthenes, referring it to the case (against Aeschines) for the Crown. In doing so he omits <foreign lang="greek">περί</foreign>. Of course <foreign lang="greek">ἡ περὶ Δημοσθένους δίκη</foreign> cannot have this meaning: and it is most probable that it is not the Orator that is here referred to, but Thucydides' general, or some other person of the name. <pb n="245"/> Neither is anything known of Nicanor and his murderers. On the use of Demosthenes' name in the Rhetoric, see Introd. p. 46, note 2. </p>
						<p>&lsquo;And again, the case of him that died at Thebes; concerning whom he (the spokesman of the defendants) bade them (the judges) decide whether he (the murdered man) deserved death, since there was no injustice in putting to death one that deserved it&rsquo;. &ldquo;In hanc quoque historiam nunquam incidi.&rdquo; Victorius. Buhle rightly refers it to the case of Euphron, introduced as an episode, and described at length by Xenophon, Hellen. VII 3. There had been one of the usual quarrels between the aristocratical (<foreign lang="greek">οἱ βέλτιστοι</foreign>) and the popular party at Sicyon, of which Euphron took advantage, with the design of making himself master of the city. But knowing that as long as the Thebans occupied the acropolis he had no chance of success, he collected a large sum of money and went to Thebes with the intention of bribing the Thebans to assist him. Some Sicyonian exiles learning this, followed him to Thebes and murdered him in the acropolis. Here the murderers were brought to trial before the magistrates and council, who were already there assembled. The accusation of the magistrates, and the speech for the defence, are both recorded. All the accused with one exception asserted their innocence: one alone admitted the fact, and in justification of it pleaded for himself and the rest the guilt of the man that had been slain, just as Aristotle here describes it. <foreign lang="greek">Οἱ μὲν οὖν Θηβαῖοι ταῦτα ἀκούσαντες ἔγνωσαν δίκαια τὸν Εὔφρονα πεπονθέναι</foreign>. But the Sicyonians (<foreign lang="greek">οἱ πολῖται</foreign>), interpreting the word &lsquo;good&rsquo; in the sense of good to them (<foreign lang="greek">τοὺς εὐεργέτας ἑαυτῶν</foreign>), said he was a <hi rend="italic">good</hi> man, and buried him in the market-place, and adore him as the (second) founder of their city (<foreign lang="greek">ὡς ἀρχηγέτην</foreign>), like Brasidas at Amphipolis (Thuc. V. 11). </p>
						<p>The whole of this section, with the exception of the last example, <foreign lang="greek">καὶ περὶ τοῦ Θήβησιν ἀποθανόντος</foreign>, is quoted by Dionysius l. c. in support of his view that Demosthenes' speeches had been delivered before the composition of the Rhetoric, and were accessible to its author. The difference between the text which he seems to have used and that now received is very great, and apparently unaccountable. Besides minor discrepancies, the entire quotation from Theodectes, <foreign lang="greek">ἐνιότε γὰρκτανεῖν</foreign> is omitted; and the clauses preceding and following stand thus, <foreign lang="greek">ἔστι δὲ τοῦτο παραλογίσασθαι. οὐ γὰρ εἰ δικαίως ἔπαθεν ᾄν, καὶ δικαίως ὑπὸ τούτου πέπονθεν, ὡς ὁ φόνου ἄξια ποιήσας πατήρ, εἰ ὑπὸ τοῦ υἱοῦ τοῦ ἑαυτοῦ τὴν ἐπὶ θανάτῳ ἀπάγεται, δεῖ σκοπεῖν χωρὶς......ὁποτέρως ἂν ἁρμόττῃ. ἐνιότε γὰρ διαφωνεῖ τὸ τοιοῦτον. ὥσπερ ἐν τῷ Ἀλκμαίωνι τοῦ Θεοδέκτου, καὶ οἷον ἡ περὶ Δημοσθένους δίκη κ.τ.λ.</foreign> All the alterations seem to be for the worse, and in one of them, <foreign lang="greek">ἔπαθεν ἄν</foreign> for <foreign lang="greek">ἔπαθέν τι</foreign>, the grammatical blunder betrays corruption. The additional example of the father and son introduced by Dionysius is, as Spengel observes, not here in point. The very example for the sake of which the extract was made is mutilated, and the explanation, <foreign lang="greek">ἐπεὶ γὰρ αποθανεῖν</foreign>, omitted: from which Spengel very justly argues that it could <pb n="246"/> not have been in the MS that he used: if he had read it there, he could not have so absurdly misapplied the example to the case for the Crown<hi rend="italic">:</hi> Spengel has reviewed the two passages in connexion in the tract above cited, pp. 44&mdash;47. Our text, which is, when properly explained, perfectly consistent and intelligible, is retained by Bekker and seems to require no alteration: at all events none of Dionysius' variations could be advantageously introduced. </p>

						<p>Top. IV. The argument from greater to less&mdash;from that which is more to be expected to that which is less (Brandis)&mdash;and the converse; Top. B 10, 114 <hi rend="italic">b</hi> 37 seq. To which is subjoined, &sect; 5, <foreign lang="greek">εἰ μήτε μᾶλλον μήτε ἧττον</foreign>, where two things are compared which are equally likely or probable, and accordingly the one may be inferred from the other: of this there are three cases, <foreign lang="greek">ἐκ τοῦ ὁμοίως ὑπάρχειν ἢ δοκεῖν ὑπάρχειν τριχῶς</foreign>. Top. Ib. 115 <hi rend="italic">a</hi> 15. Of the first there are four varieties: according as (1) the more or less is predicated of the <hi rend="italic">same</hi> object&mdash;if pleasure is good, then the greater the pleasure the greater the good; and if wrong-doing is bad, the greater the wrong the worse; the <hi rend="italic">fact</hi> is to be ascertained by induction&mdash;or (2) when one of two things is predicated (in the way of comparison), if that of which it is more likely to be predicated is without it (any property or quality), the same may be inferred of the less likely; or conversely, if the less likely has it, <hi rend="italic">a fortiori</hi> the more likely: or (3) (the reverse of the preceding) when two things are predicated of one, if the more likely is not there, we may infer that the less likely will not, or if the less likely be found there, that the more likely will also: (4) when two things are predicated of two others, if that which is more likely is wanting to the one, the less likely will surely be wanting to the other; or, conversely, if that which is less likely to be present to the one is there, the other will be sure to have that which is more likely [Grote's <hi rend="italic">Ar.</hi> I. p. 425]. These nice distinctions, though appropriate to Dialectics, are unnecessary in Rhetoric, and are therefore here omitted; but the examples will suggest the proper use of the topic. The inference in all these cases is plain and will be acknowledged by the audience, and that is all that is required. </p>
						<p>The inference from greater to less, or from more to less likely or probable, is commonly called the <hi rend="italic">argumentum a fortiori;</hi> the rule <hi rend="italic">omne maius continet in se minus</hi> may also be referred to the same principle, though the two are not absolutely coextensive. </p>
						<p>Cic.Topic. III 11, <hi rend="italic">Alia</hi> (ducuntur argumenta) <hi rend="italic">ex comparatione maiorum aut parium aut minorum.</hi> This is well exemplified in IV 23. XVIII 68, <hi rend="italic">Reliquus est comparationis locus cuius...nunc explicanda tractatio est. Comparantur igitur ea quae aut maiora aut minora aut paria dicuntur: in quibus spectantur haec, numerus, species, vis, quaedam etiam ad res aliquas affectio.</hi> These four modes of application are clearly explained and illustrated in the following sections, 69&mdash;71. </p>
						<p>De Orat. II 40. 172, <hi rend="italic">Maiora autem et minora et paria comparabimus sic: ex maiore; si bona existimatio divitiis praestat et pecunia tanto opere expetitur, quanto gloria magis est expetenda: ex minore; Hic</hi> <pb n="247"/> <hi rend="italic">parvae consuetudinis causa huius mortem fert tam familiariter; Quid si ipse amasset? quid hic mihi faciet patri?</hi> (Terent. Andr. I 1. 83)<hi rend="italic">: ex pari sic; est eiusdem et eripere et contra rempublicam largiri pecunias.</hi> </p>

V 10. 86&mdash;93, Apposita <hi rend="italic">vel</hi> comparativa <hi rend="italic">dicuntur quae maiora ex minoribus, minora ex maioribus, paria ex paribus probant.</hi> These are applied, subdivided, and illustrated through the remaining sections. </p>
						<p>&lsquo;Another from the more or less, as for instance, &ldquo;if not even the gods are omniscient, surely men can hardly be supposed to be so:&rdquo; for that is as much as to say, if that to which something is more likely to belong wants it, plainly that which is less likely must want it too. Again (the argument) that a man who was capable of striking his father would also strike his neighbours, follows (is derived from) the (general rule or principle), that the less involves or implies the (possible existence, or capacity, <foreign lang="greek">δύναμις</foreign>, of the) greater; in whichever way we are required to argue (the inference is required to be drawn), whether the affirmative or the negative&rsquo;. This last example, as an exemplification of the inference from less to greater, has been looked upon as an error, and various corrections have been proposed, as by Vater, and Spengel in <hi rend="italic">Specim. Comm. ad Ar. Rhet.</hi> II c. 23, p. 12, 1844. The latter has subsequently altered his opinion, and in 1851 (<hi rend="italic">Trans. of Bav. Acad.</hi> p. 58) he admits that the explanation suggested by Victorius, and adopted by Muretus, Majoragius, and others, is sufficient to support the text; which, as usual, is retained by Bekker. No doubt, according to the ordinary interpretation of <foreign lang="greek">μᾶλλον</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">ἧττον</foreign> in one of these comparisons, where the greater and less are referred to the <hi rend="italic">magnitude</hi> and <hi rend="italic">importance</hi> of the crime, the argument is <foreign lang="greek">ἐκ τοῦ μᾶλλον</foreign>, <hi rend="italic">ex maiore ad minus:</hi> the man who would strike his father (the greater) would <hi rend="italic">a fortiori</hi> strike an ordinary acquaintance. But Ar. has here departed from this usual application of the topic, and makes the comparison in respect of the <hi rend="italic">frequency</hi> of the crime: as it is less usual to strike one's father than one's neighbour, a man that could be guilty of the former, is much <hi rend="italic">more likely</hi> to commit the latter and lesser offence: and the inference is from the less to the greater <hi rend="italic">in this sense.</hi> &ldquo;Aristoteles, cum boni viri officium sit nemini vim afferre, cumque iniuria ab omni abesse debeat, si tamen ibi manet ubi minus esse debebat, illic etiam existet ubi frequentius esse consuevit: et haec causa est cur <foreign lang="greek">εἰ τὸ ἧττον ὑπάρχει</foreign> appellarit, <hi rend="italic">a minore</hi> que eam significari voluerit.&rdquo; Victorius. </p>
						<p>On the double reading of MS A^{c}, see Spengel, <hi rend="italic">Trans. of Bav. Acad.</hi> 1851 p. 57 [and to the same effect in Spengel's ed., 1867; &ldquo;in A post <foreign lang="greek">δέῃ δεῖξαι</foreign> haec sententia alia ratione verbis <foreign lang="greek">τύπτει ὅτι...δεῖ δεῖξαι</foreign> explicatur...duplicem sententiae formam iuxta positam melius perspiciemus: <pb n="248"/> On these Aristotelian <foreign lang="greek">διττογραφίαι</foreign>, see Torstrik, Praef. ad de Anima, p. xxi, seq. </p>

						<p>The second branch of these inferences from comparison, is that of parallel cases. This is the argument from analogy, the foundation of induction, the observation of resemblances in things diverse, leading to the establishment of a general rule: the Socratic and Platonic Method: comp. c. 20. 4, note. <hi rend="italic">Ex pari</hi>, Cic. de Inv. I 30. 47, <hi rend="italic">ut locus in mari sine portu navibus esse non potest tutus, sic animus sine fide stabilis amicis non potest esse.</hi> On the argument from analogy in general, see note on c. 19. 2. </p>
						<p>&lsquo;Again if the comparison is not of greater and less, (but of things equal or parallel): whence the saying, &ldquo;Thy father too is to be pitied for the loss of his children. And is not Oeneus then, for the loss of his illustrious offspring?&rdquo; <foreign lang="greek">ἄρα</foreign> marks the inference. &ldquo;Par infortunium parem misericordiam meretur.&rdquo; Schrader. The verses are supposed (by Victorius, Welcker, <hi rend="italic">Trag. Gr.</hi> p. 1012, and Wagner, <hi rend="italic">Fr. Trag. Gr.</hi> III 185) to be taken from Antiphon's Meleager, which is quoted again &sect; 20, and at II 2. 19. (Antiphon, a Tragic Poet contemporary with the Elder Dionysius, Rhet. II 6. 19, Clinton <hi rend="italic">F. H.</hi> Vol. II. Praef. XXXIII, flourished at the end of the fifth cent. B. C. Compare note on II 2. 19.) </p>
						<p>The first of the two verses&mdash;if the story is that of Meleager&mdash;refers to the death of the two sons of Thestius, Toxeus and Plexippus, by the hand of their nephew Meleager: Oeneus was the father of Meleager, whom he too had now lost. The words are those of some one who is consoling Althea, Oeneus' wife, and perhaps belong (says Victorius) to Oeneus himself. The meaning then would be, (Oeneus to his wife,) You speak of the losses of your father whose sons are slain&mdash;are not mine as great as his, in the loss of my famous son Meleager? and do we not <hi rend="italic">therefore</hi> equally deserve pity? The story is told in Diod. Sic. IV 34 (Schrader), and Ov. Met. VIII. See 86, 87, <hi rend="italic">An felix Oeneus nato victore fruetur, Thestius orbus erit? melius lugebitis ambo.</hi> </p>
						<p>The conduct of Alexander or Paris in the abduction of Helen is next justified by the <hi rend="italic">parallel case</hi> of Theseus, who did the same; Isocr. <pb n="249"/> Helen. &sect;&sect; 18&mdash;20; and every one&mdash;and more especially an <hi rend="italic">Athenian</hi> audience&mdash;must allow that he was a good man and could do no wrong (<foreign lang="greek">οὐκ ἠδίκησεν</foreign>); and of the Tyndaridae, Castor and Pollux, who carried off the two daughters of Leucippus, Phoebe and Eleaera (or Hilaira, Propert. I 2. 15), Ov. Fast. V 699, Theocr. Id. XXII 137, and these were demigods; and if Hector is not blamed for the death of Patroclus, neither should Paris be censured for that of Achilles. This is from some <foreign lang="greek">ἐγκώμιον</foreign> or <foreign lang="greek">ἀπολογία Ἀλεξάνδρου</foreign>, of an unknown rhetorician, similar to Isocrates' Helen. It is referred to again, &sect; 8, and 24 &sect;&sect; 7, 9. </p>
						<p>&lsquo;And if no other artists (professors of any art or science) are mean or contemptible, neither are philosophers: and if generals are not to be held cheap because they are often defeated, neither are the sophists (when their sophistical dialectics are at fault)&rsquo;. From some speech in defence of philosophy, and of the Sophists. </p>
						<p>The following is an argument, urged by an Athenian orator upon the general assembly, from the analogy of the relation of a private citizen to the state of which he is a member, to that of the same state as an individual member of the great community of the entire Greek race to the whole of which it is a part: if it be the duty of an individual Athenian to pay attention to, to <hi rend="italic">study</hi>, the glory of his own country, then it is the duty of you, the collective Athenians whose representatives I am now addressing, to study in like manner the glory of the entire Greek community. Or it might be used by the <hi rend="italic">epideictic</hi> orator in a Panegyric (<foreign lang="greek">πανηγυρικός λόγος</foreign>, delivered in a <foreign lang="greek">πανήγυρις</foreign>), pleading, like Isocrates, for the united action of the Greeks against the Barbarian. </p>

						<p>Top. V. The consideration of time. This kind of argument, though important in Rhetoric, is inappropriate in Dialectics, and therefore receives only a passing notice in the Topics, B 4, III <hi rend="italic">b</hi> 24, <foreign lang="greek">ἔτι ἐπὶ τὸν χρόνον ἐπιβλέπειν, εἴ που διαφωνεῖ</foreign>, where the word <foreign lang="greek">ἐπιβλέπειν</foreign> shews that it is a mere passing glance, a cursory observation, that it requires: and in Cicero's Topics it is altogether omitted [Grote's <hi rend="italic">Ar.</hi> I p. 418]. The application of it in Top. B 11, 115 <hi rend="italic">b</hi> 11, referred to by Brandis, is different, and indeed unsuited to rhetorical purposes. </p>
						<p>On this topic of time, and its importance in Rhetoric, Quintilian, Inst. Orat. V 10. 42 seq., after a preliminary division of time into (1) general (now, formerly, hereafter,) and (2) special or particular time, proceeds, <hi rend="italic">Quorum utrorumque ratio et in consiliis</hi> (genus deliberativum) <hi rend="italic">quidem, et in illo demonstrativo</hi> (<foreign lang="greek">τῷ ἐπιδεικτικῷ γένει</foreign>) <hi rend="italic">genere versatur; sed in iudiciis frequentissima est. Nam et iuris quaestiones facit, et qualitatem distinguit, et ad coniecturam plurimum confert</hi> (contributes very greatly to the establishment of the fact&mdash;the <hi rend="italic">status coniecturalis</hi> or <hi rend="italic">issue</hi> of fact&mdash; <pb n="250"/> and especially to the refutation of the assertion of an alleged fact: this is illustrated by the cases following); <hi rend="italic">ut quum interim probationes inexpugnabiles afferat, quales sunt, si dicatur</hi> (<hi rend="italic">ut supra posui</hi>) <hi rend="italic">signator, qui ante diem tabularum decessit: aut commisisse aliquid, vel quum infans esset, vel quum omnino natus non esset.</hi> Further, &sect;&sect; 45&mdash;48, arguments may be readily drawn <hi rend="italic">ex iis quae ante rem facta sunt, aut ex coniunctis rei, aut insequentibus</hi>, or from time past, present (<hi rend="italic">instans</hi>), and future: and these three are then illustrated. Inferences may be drawn from what is past or present, to the future, from cause to effect; and conversely from present to past, from effect to cause. It seems that the two principal modes of applying the topic of time to Rhetoric are (1) that described by Quintilian, in establishing, or, more frequently, refuting the assertion of a fact, which is the chief use that is made of it in the <hi rend="italic">forensic</hi> branch&mdash;this is again referred to, II 24. 11, on which see Introd. p. 274&mdash;the consideration of probabilities of time in matters of fact: and (2) the <foreign lang="greek">καιρός</foreign>, the right time, the appropriate occasion, which may be employed by the <hi rend="italic">deliberative</hi> orator or politician in estimating the expediency, immediate or prospective, of an act or course of policy; and by the <hi rend="italic">panegyrist</hi> to enhance the value and importance of any action of his hero, or of anything else which may be the object of his encomium. On this use of <foreign lang="greek">καιρός</foreign> comp. I 7. 32, I 9.38, and the notes. For illustrations, see Top. <foreign lang="greek">Γ</foreign> 2, 117 <hi rend="italic">a</hi> 26&mdash;<hi rend="italic">b</hi> 2. </p>
						<p>&lsquo;Another from the consideration of time, as Iphicrates said in the case (<hi rend="italic">subaudi</hi> <foreign lang="greek">δίκῃ</foreign>) against Harmodius, &ldquo;Had I before the deed was done laid claim to the statue, provided I did it, you would have granted it me; will you then (the inference) refuse to grant it me now that I <hi rend="italic">have</hi> done it? Do not, then, first make the promise in anticipation, and then, when you have received the benefit, defraud me of it.&rdquo;&rsquo; The case, or speech, as it is here called &lsquo;against Harmodius&rsquo;, is also known by the name of <foreign lang="greek">ἡ περὶ τῆς εἰκόνος</foreign>: this was the statue which was granted him in commemoration of the famous defeat of the Lacedaemonian <foreign lang="greek">μόρα</foreign> in B. C. 392. Aesch. c. Ctesiph. &sect; 243, Ask the judges why they made the presents, and set up the statues, to Chabrias, Iphicrates, and Timotheus. The answer is, <foreign lang="greek">Ἰφικράτει ὅτι μόραν Λακεδαιμονίων ἀπέκτεινεν</foreign>. [Dem. <hi rend="italic">Lept.</hi> 482 &sect; 84, <foreign lang="greek">τιμῶντές ποτε Ἰφικράτην οὐ μόνον αὐτὸν ἐτιμήσατε</foreign>...<hi rend="italic">ib.</hi> &sect; 86, <foreign lang="greek">οὐδὲ γὰρ ὑμῖν ἁρμόττει δοκεῖν παρὰ μὲν τὰς εὐεργεσίας οὕτω προχείρως ἔχειν, ὥστε μὴ μόνον αὐτοὺς τοὺς εὐεργέτας τιμᾶν, ἀλλὰ καὶ τοὺς ἐκείνων φίλους, ἐπειδὰν δὲ χρόνος διέλθῃ βραχύς, καὶ ὅσα αὐτοῖς δέδωκατε ταῦτ’  ἀφαιρεῖσθαι</foreign>]. The speech here referred to was attributed by some &mdash;as Pseudo-Plutarch vit. Lys. <foreign lang="greek">συνέγραψε δὲ λόγον καὶ Ἰφικράτει· τὸν μὲν πρὸς Ἁρμόδιον</foreign>&mdash;to Lysias<note anchored="yes">See on this and two other speeches of Iphicrates attributed to Lysias, Sauppe, ad Fragm. Lys. XVIII and LXV. <hi rend="italic">Oratores Attici</hi> III 178 and 190; [also Blass, <hi rend="italic">die Attische Beredsamkeit</hi>, p. 335].</note>, which is denied by Dionysius, de Lysia <pb n="251"/> Iud. c. 12, on two grounds, first the inferiority of the style, which was unworthy of Lysias; and secondly, because Lysias died seven years before the deed for which the statue was granted. Aristotle plainly ascribes it to Iphicrates himself. The speech <foreign lang="greek">περὶ τῆς εἰκόνος</foreign>, is quoted again, &sect; 8. See also Clinton <hi rend="italic">Fasti Hellenici</hi> II 113, <hi rend="italic">sub anno</hi> 371. It was not till after Iphicrates had resigned his military command, and retired into private life, <foreign lang="greek">ἀποδοὺς τὰ στρατεύματα ἰδιώτης γίνεται</foreign>, that he claimed his statue, <foreign lang="greek">μετὰ Ἀλκισθένην ἄρχοντα</foreign>, i. e. in the archonship of Pharsiclides, B. C. 371. The grant was opposed by Harmodius, a political antagonist. </p>
						<p>&lsquo;And again to induce the Thebans to allow Philip to pass through their territories into Attica, it is argued that, &ldquo;had he made the claim (or preferred the request) before he helped them against the Phocians (when they wanted his aid), they would have promised to do so; and therefore it would be monstrous for them <hi rend="italic">now</hi> to refuse it, because he threw away his chance (<hi rend="italic">then</hi>)&rsquo;;&mdash;behaved liberally or with reckless generosity (so Vict.) on that occasion, and neglected to avail himself of his opportunity, (see the lexicons, s. v. <foreign lang="greek">προίεσθαι</foreign>)&mdash;&lsquo;and trusted to their honour and good faith&rsquo;. The former event occurred in B. C. 346, when Philip allied himself with the Thebans and overran Phocis, and so put an end to the Phocian war. An embassy was sent to the Thebans after the capture of Elataea B. C. 339, to request that Philip's troops might be allowed to march through their territory to attack Attica; but was met by a counter-embassy from Athens, proposed and accompanied by Demosthenes, who prevailed upon the Thebans to refuse the request, and conclude an alliance with Athens. <foreign lang="greek">κατὰ Λυσιμαχίδην ἄρχοντα</foreign>, Dionys, Ep. 1 ad Amm. c. 11. On this embassy and the proposals there made, see Demosthenes himself, de Cor. &sect;&sect; 311, 313, from which it would seem that the words here quoted are not Philip's, but an argument used by his ambassadors. Comp. also &sect; 146, <foreign lang="greek">οὔτ’  εἰς τὴν Ἀττικὴν ἐλθεῖν δυνατός... μήτε Θηβαίων διιέντων</foreign>: and Aesch. c. Ctes. &sect; 151, <foreign lang="greek">καὶ γράψειν ἔφη ψήφισμα</foreign> (<foreign lang="greek">ὁ Δημοσθένης</foreign>)...<foreign lang="greek">πέμπειν ὑμᾶς πρέσβεις αἰτήσοντας Θηβαίους διόδον ἐπὶ Φίλιππον</foreign>, (referred to by Spengel, <hi rend="italic">Specim. Comm. ad Ar. Rhet.</hi> Heidelb. 1844, p. 15). In the following year, 338 B. C. <foreign lang="greek">ἐπὶ ἄρχοντος Χαιρώνδου</foreign>, was fought the battle of Chaeronea. M. Schmidt (<hi rend="italic">On the date of the Rhet.</hi> Halle, 1837, p. 16) uses this passage in fixing the date of Ar.'s work. [See Introd. p. 38.] </p>
						<p>Dionys., ad Amm. c. 11, cites the whole of this topic. The only important variations are two manifest blunders; the omission of <foreign lang="greek">εἰς</foreign> before <foreign lang="greek">Φωκεῖς</foreign>, and <foreign lang="greek">διέσπευσεν μὴ δώσουσιν</foreign> for <foreign lang="greek">ἐπίστευσε μὴ διήσουσιν</foreign>. </p>

						<p>Top. VI. This topic, &ldquo;the retort which turns the point of what has been said against ourselves upon him who said it,&rdquo; viz. the adverse <pb n="252"/> party in the law-court or assembly, belongs, as Brandis also remarks, u. s., p. 19, exclusively to Rhetoric. &ldquo;Cum argumentum ducitur ex iis quae ex moribus vitaque ipsorum dicta sunt, admodumque ipsis congruunt, adversus illum ipsum qui dixit: eminet autem, inquit, hic inter alios, ac vim maximam semper habere existimatus est.&rdquo; Victorius. That <foreign lang="greek">κατά</foreign> in the definition means &lsquo;against&rsquo; and not &lsquo;of&rsquo; (in respect of) appears from the example. Iphicrates asks Aristophon, who had accused him of taking bribes to betray the fleet, &ldquo;Would you have done it yourself? No; I am not like <hi rend="italic">you.</hi> Well then, as you admit that <hi rend="italic">you</hi>, Aristophon, are incapable of it, must not I, Iphicrates, (your superior in virtue and everything else,) be still more incapable of it?&rdquo; As Ar. adds, the argument is worth nothing unless the person who uses it is conscious of his own moral superiority, and knows that the audience whom he addresses shares his conviction: employed against an &lsquo;Aristides the Just&rsquo;, it would be simply ridiculous. </p>
						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">διαφέρει δὲ ὁ τρόπος κ.τ.λ.</lemma>] This is interpreted by Spengel, <hi rend="italic">Specim. Comm.</hi> u. s., p. 16 [and ed. 1867], &ldquo;<hi rend="italic">Mores</hi> sunt qui in hac re in discrimen vocantur; mores enim et vita eminet et litigantes discernit.&rdquo; I doubt if <foreign lang="greek">τρόπος</foreign>, standing thus alone, can mean <hi rend="italic">mores:</hi> nor, I think, is the mention of character and manners appropriate in this place: further on it would be suitable. Gaisford's explanation and connexion seem to be upon the whole most satisfactory. &ldquo;Verba <foreign lang="greek">οἷον ἐν τῷ Τεύκρῳεἴπειεν</foreign> puto esse <foreign lang="greek">διὰ μέσου</foreign>. His certe seclusis belle procedunt omnia. Sententiae nexus hic est; <hi rend="italic">Excellit autem hic modus</hi> (vel <hi rend="italic">locus</hi>&mdash;reading <foreign lang="greek">τόπος</foreign>), Sed ad fidem accusatori detrahendam.&rdquo; And in that case, Quintilian's words, V 12. 19, <hi rend="italic">Aristoteles quidem potentissimum putat ex eo qui dicit, si sit vir optimus</hi> &amp;c., may be a translation of <foreign lang="greek">διαφέρει ὁ τρόπος. διαφέρειν</foreign>, if thus understood, denotes &lsquo;pre-eminence, distinction above others&rsquo;. </p>
						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">οἷον ἐν τῷ Τεύκρῳ</lemma>] This is no doubt Sophocles' tragedy of that name: of which four fragments (and one doubtful one) still survive. See Wagner, <hi rend="italic">Fragm. Tr. Gr.</hi> 1 388, 9. &ldquo;Quum Ar. ubi poetarum nomina omisit tantummodo clarissimos quosque respexerit, facile inducimur ut eum Sophoclis Teucrum dixisse credamus.&rdquo; And Spengel, <hi rend="italic">Spec. Comm.</hi> u. s., p. 16 [and ed.] &ldquo;Sophoclis puto; si alius esset, nomen addidisset.&rdquo; The same play is quoted again, III 15. 9, whence it appears that Ulysses was one of the characters. In an altercation with Teucer, the latter must be supposed to have used a similar argument, or retort, founded upon his own acknowledged superiority in moral character<note anchored="yes">Ulysses may be supposed to have accused Teucer of the murder of his brother&mdash; comp. Aj. 1012 seq. and 1021, where such a suspicion is hinted at: If <hi rend="italic">you</hi>, Ulysses, are shocked at such a crime, do you suppose that <hi rend="italic">I</hi>, Teucer, could have been guilty of it? The same argument was employed by Euripides in his Telephus. Fragm. XII, Dindorf, ap. Arist. Acharn. 554. Wagner, II p. 364. Fr. Tel. 24. <foreign lang="greek">ταῦτ’  οἶδ̓ ὅτι ἂν ἔδρατε</foreign> (ita Meineke), <foreign lang="greek">τὸν δὲ Τήλεφον οὐκ οἰόμεσθα</foreign>; comp. Valck. Diatr. ad Fr. Eurip. p. 211, &ldquo;Telephi verba cum Ulysse loquentis.&rdquo; Ulysses had been making some charge against Telephus, who makes this reply: <hi rend="italic">You</hi> would have done so and so: am <hi rend="italic">I</hi> not as likely, or still more so, to have done the same? Plut. <foreign lang="greek">ἀποφθ. βασιλέων</foreign>, Alex. II, p. 180 B, <foreign lang="greek">Δαρείον δίδοντος αὐτῷ μυρία τάλαντα καὶ τὴν Ἀσίαν νείμασθαι πρὸς αὐτὸν ἐπίσης, καὶ Παρμενίωνος εἰπόντος, ἔλαβον ἂν εἰ Ἀλέξανδρος ἤμην, κἀγώ, νὴ Δία, εἶπεν, εἰ Παρμενίων ἤμην</foreign>.</note>. See Wagner l. c. <pb n="253"/> who gives a long account of the subject of the play, and compares it with Pacuvius' play of the same name, supposed to be borrowed from Sophocles. </p>
						<p>Aristophon was already celebrated as an orator in 403 B. C. (Clinton, <hi rend="italic">F. H., sub anno.</hi>) His fame may be inferred from the frequent and respectful mention of him by Demosthenes especially (see for instance, de Cor. &sect; 219, de Fals. Leg. &sect; 339), Aeschines and Dinarchus. See Baiter et Sauppe, <hi rend="italic">Orat. Att., Ind. Nom.</hi> s. v., p. 21, Vol. III. He was an Azenian, <foreign lang="greek">Ἀζηνιεύς</foreign>, and thereby distinguished from his namesake of Collytus, de Cor. &sect; 93. The speech to which Iphicrates here replies was delivered in &ldquo;the prosecution of Iphicrates by him and Chares for his failure in the last campaign of the Social war, Diod. XVI 15. 21,&rdquo; (Clint. <hi rend="italic">F. H. sub anno</hi>,) in the year 355 B. C., at an already advanced age. See also Sauppe, Fragm. Lys. 65, <hi rend="italic">Or.

Iud. c. 12, comp. note on &sect; 6 supra. on that against Harmodius), from which Iphicrates' saying against Harmodius is supposed to have been extracted, see Sauppe, Fragm. Lys. LXV, (<hi rend="italic">Orat. Att.</hi> III 190): and comp. ibid. p. 191, Aristid.

						<p>Top. VII. Definition. The definition of terms is the basis of all sound argument, and the ambiguity of terms one of the most abundant sources of fallacy and misunderstanding. A clear definition is therefore necessary for intelligible reasoning. To establish definitions, and so come to a clear understanding of the thing in controversy, was, as Aristotle tells us, the end and object of the Socratic method. The use of the definition in dialectics is treated in the Topics, A 15, 107 <hi rend="italic">a</hi> 36 &mdash;<hi rend="italic">b</hi> 5 [Grote's <hi rend="italic">Ar.</hi> I p. 404], B 2, 109 <hi rend="italic">b</hi> 13 seq. and 30 seq. Cic. Topic. V 26&mdash;VII 32. De Inv. II 17. 53&mdash;56. Orat. Part. XII 41. De Orat. II 39. 164. Quint. V 10. 36, and 54 seq. </p>
						<p>The <hi rend="italic">first</hi> example of the argument from definition, is the inference drawn by Socrates at his trial from the definition of <foreign lang="greek">τὸ δαιμόνιον</foreign>, Plat. Apol. Socr. c. 15. Meletus accuses him of teaching his young associates not to believe in the gods recognized by the state, and introducing other new divinities, <foreign lang="greek">ἕτερα δαιμόνια καινά</foreign>, in their place. Socrates argues that upon Meletus' own admission he believes in <foreign lang="greek">δαιμόνια</foreign> divine things (27 C); but divine things or works imply a workman; and therefore a belief in <foreign lang="greek">δαιμόνια</foreign> necessarily implies a belief in the authors of those works, viz. <foreign lang="greek">δαίμονες</foreign>. But <foreign lang="greek">δαίμονες</foreign> are universally held to be either <foreign lang="greek">θεοί</foreign> or <foreign lang="greek">θεῶν παῖδες</foreign> (27 D), and therefore in either case a belief in <foreign lang="greek">δαιμόνια</foreign> still implies a belief in the gods. The conclusion is <foreign lang="greek">τοῦ αὐτοῦ εἶναι δαιμόνια καὶ θεῖα ἡγεῖσθαι</foreign> (E). </p>
						<p>In Xenophon's apology this argument is entirely omitted; and Socrates is represented as interpreting the <foreign lang="greek">καινὰ δαιμόνια</foreign> (which he is accused of introducing) of <foreign lang="greek">τὸ δαιμόνιον</foreign>, the divine sign which checked him when he was about to do wrong; and this is referred to the class of divine communications&mdash;oracles, omens, divination and so forth. </p>
						<p>As to the status of the <foreign lang="greek">δαίμονες</foreign> opinions varied: but the usual conception of them was, as appears in Hesiod, Op. et D. 121, and many passages of Plato, Timaeus, Laws (VIII 848 D, <foreign lang="greek">θεῶν τε καὶ τῶν ἑπομένων θεοῖς δαιμόνων</foreign>), IV 713 B, <foreign lang="greek">οὐκ ἀνθρώπους ἀλλὰ γένους θειοτέρου τε καὶ ἀμείνονος, δαίμονας</foreign>, and elsewhere, that they were an order of beings, like angels, intermediate between men and gods, and having the office of tutelary deities or guardian angels to the human race. So Hesiod, u. s., Theogn. 1348 (of Ganymede), Plat. Phaedo 108 B, 107 D, 113 D. Aristotle seems to imply the same distinction when he says, de Div. per Somn. 1 2, init., that dreams are not <foreign lang="greek">θἐπεμπτα</foreign>, because they are natural, <foreign lang="greek">δαιμόνια μέντοι· ἡ γὰρ</foreign> <pb n="256"/> <foreign lang="greek">φύσις δαιμονία, ἀλλ’  οὐ θεία</foreign>. This argument of Socrates is repeated, III 18. 2, more at length, and with some difference of detail. </p>
						<p>The <hi rend="italic">second</hi> example is taken from Iphicrates' speech upon the prosecution of Harmodius, the <foreign lang="greek">δίκη πρὸς Ἁρμόδιον</foreign>, <hi rend="italic">supra</hi> &sect; 6, &ldquo;cum Harmodius generis obscuritatem obiiceret, definitione <hi rend="italic">generosi</hi> et <hi rend="italic">propinqui</hi> fastum adversarii repressit et decus suum defendit.&rdquo; Schrader. Harmodius had evidently been boasting of his descent from the famous Harmodius, and contrasting his own noble birth with the low origin of Iphicrates. The latter replies, by defining true nobility to be merit, and not mere family distinction (comp. II 15, and the motto of Trinity College, <hi rend="italic">virtus vera nobilitas</hi> [Iuv. VIII. 20 <hi rend="italic">nobilitas sola est atque unica virtus</hi>]); &lsquo;for Harmodius (himself) and Aristogeiton had no <hi rend="italic">nobility</hi> anterior to their noble <hi rend="italic">deed</hi>&rsquo;. Next as to the relationship which Harmodius claimed: he himself is in reality more nearly related to Harmodius than his own descendant: true kinsmanship is shewn in similarity of actions: &lsquo;at all events my <hi rend="italic">deeds</hi> are more nearly akin to those of Harmodius and Aristogeiton than thine&rsquo;. This is still more pointedly expressed in Plutarch's version, <foreign lang="greek">Ἀποφθέγματα βασιλέων καὶ στρατηγῶν</foreign> Iphicr. <foreign lang="greek">έ</foreign>, p. 187 B, <foreign lang="greek">πρὸς δὲ Ἁρμόδιον, τὸν τοῦ παλαιοῦ Ἁρμοδίου ἀπόγονον, εἰς δυσγένειαν αὐτῷ λοιδορούμενον ἔφη· τὸ μὲν ἐμὸν ἀπ’  ἐμοῦ γένος ἄρχεται, τὸ δὲ σὸν ἐν σοὶ παύεται</foreign>. This seems to be taken, with alterations, from a speech of Lysias, ap. Stob. flor. 86. 15, quoted by Sauppe, Fragm. Lys. XVIII. <hi rend="italic">Or. Att.</hi> III 180. Another form of Iphicrates' saying, briefer still, is found in Pseudo-Plut. <foreign lang="greek">περὶ εὐγενείας</foreign> c. 21 (ap. Sauppe u. s.), <foreign lang="greek">Ἰφικράτης ὀνειδιζόμενος εἰς δυσγένειαν· ἐγὼ ἄρξω, εἶπε, τοῦ γένους</foreign>. </p>
						<p>The <hi rend="italic">third</hi> is taken from the Alexander of some unknown apologist, quoted before, &sect; 5, and &sect; 12; and c. 24. 7 and 9. On this Schrader; &ldquo;sententia illius videtur haec esse: Paridem intemperantem habendum non esse, una quippe Helena contentum. Argumentum e definitione temperantis (temperantiae) petitum.&rdquo; Similarly Victorius, &ldquo;<foreign lang="greek">μὴ κόσμιος</foreign> est qui una contentus non est...sed quot videt formosas mulieres tot amat. Cum sola Helena ipse contentus vixerit, non debet intemperans vocari.&rdquo; </p>
						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ἑνός</lemma> therefore is &lsquo;one only&rsquo;, and <foreign lang="greek">ἀγαπᾶν</foreign> &lsquo;to be satisfied with&rsquo;. <foreign lang="greek">ἀπόλαυσις</foreign>, of <hi rend="italic">sensual</hi> enjoyment, Eth. N. I 3, sub init., <foreign lang="greek">ὁ ἀπολαυστικὸς βίος</foreign>, the life of a Sardanapalus. Ib. III 13, 1118 <hi rend="italic">a</hi> 30, <foreign lang="greek">ἀπολαύσει, ἡ γίνεται πᾶσα δἰ ἁφῆς καὶ ἐν σιτίοις καὶ ἐν ποτοῖς καὶ τοῖς ἀφροδισίοις λεγομένοις</foreign>. VII 6, 1148 <hi rend="italic">a</hi> 5, <foreign lang="greek">τὰς σωματικὰς ἀπολαύσεις</foreign>. <pb n="257"/> </p>
						<p>The <hi rend="italic">fourth</hi> is, the reason that Socrates gave for refusing to go to pay a visit to Archelaus; that it would be ignominious to him, to receive favours from a man, and then not to have the power of requiting the benefits (good treatment) in the same way as one would injuries (ill treatment). This was a new definition, or an extension of the ordinary one, of <foreign lang="greek">ὕβρις</foreign>, which is &ldquo;wanton outrage,&rdquo; <hi rend="italic">supra</hi> II 2. 5, an <hi rend="italic">act</hi> of aggression. <foreign lang="greek">ὕβρις</foreign> usually implies hostility on the part of him who inflicts it; in this case the offer of a supposed benefit is construed as inflicting the ignominy. </p>
						<p>The abstract <foreign lang="greek">ὕβρις</foreign>, for the concrete <foreign lang="greek">ὑβριστικόν</foreign>, occurs often elsewhere, as in Soph. Oed. Col. 883, <foreign lang="greek">ἆρ’  οὐχ ὕβρις τάδ̓</foreign>; KP. <foreign lang="greek">ὕβρις· ἀλλ’  ἀνεκτέα</foreign>. Arist. Ran. 21, <foreign lang="greek">εἶτ’  οὐχ ὕβρις ταῦτ̓ ἐστί</foreign>; Lysistr. 658, Nub. 1299. Similarly Ter. Andr. I 5. 2, <hi rend="italic">quid est si hoc non contumelia est?</hi> (Reisig ad loc Soph.) And in other words; <foreign lang="greek">ὦ μῖσος</foreign> (i. e. <foreign lang="greek">μισητόν</foreign> hated <hi rend="italic">object</hi>) <foreign lang="greek">εἰς Ἕλληνας</foreign>, Eur. Iph. T. 512; <foreign lang="greek">ὦ μῖσος</foreign>, Med. 1323, and Soph. Philoct. 991. <foreign lang="greek">ἄλγος</foreign> for <foreign lang="greek">ἀλγεινόν</foreign>, Aesch. Pr. Vinct. 261. Eur. Ion, 528 <foreign lang="greek">γέλως</foreign> for <foreign lang="greek">γελοῖον</foreign>, and Dem. de F. L. &sect; 82, <foreign lang="greek">ἔστι δὲ ταῦτα γέλως, μᾶλλον δ’  ἀναισχυντία δεινή</foreign>. Arist. Acharn. 125, <foreign lang="greek">ταῦτα δῆτ’  οὐκ ἀγχόνη</foreign>. </p>
						<p>The contempt of Archelaus implied in this refusal is noticed by Diog. Laert., Vit. Socr. II 5. 25, <foreign lang="greek">ὑπερεφρόνησε δὲ καὶ Ἀρχελάου τοῦ Μακεδόνος...μήτε παρ’  αὐτοὺς ἀπελθών</foreign>; and see Schneider's note on Xenophon, Apol. Socr. &sect; 17, on Socrates' ordinary conduct in respect of the acceptance of fees and gratuities and favours in general. On Archelaus and his usurpation of the throne of Macedonia, and his tyranny and crimes, see Plato Gorg. c. XXVI p. 470 C&mdash;471 C. </p>
						<p>&lsquo;For all these first define the term (they are about to use), and then, having found its true essence and nature, they proceed to draw their inference (conclude) from it on the point that they are arguing. The <foreign lang="greek">ὅρος</foreign> or <foreign lang="greek">ὁρισμός</foreign>, &lsquo;definition&rsquo;, is itself defined at length, Metaph. <foreign lang="greek">Δ</foreign> 12, 1037 <hi rend="italic">b</hi> 25, seq.: and more briefly Top. A 8, 103 <hi rend="italic">b</hi> 15, 101 <hi rend="italic">b</hi> 39, Z 6, 143 <hi rend="italic">b</hi> 20. The definition of a thing is its <foreign lang="greek">λόγος, τὸ τί ἦν εἶναι σημαίνων</foreign>, that which expresses the <hi rend="italic">formal cause</hi> of a thing; the <hi rend="italic">what it was to be;</hi> the essence of it, or that which makes it what it is. Only <foreign lang="greek">εἴδη</foreign> or species can, strictly speaking, be defined: the definition of the <foreign lang="greek">εἶδος</foreign> gives the <foreign lang="greek">γένος</foreign>, the essentials, together with the <foreign lang="greek">διαφορά</foreign>, or specific difference: and these two constitute the definition; which is here accordingly said to express <foreign lang="greek">τὸ τί ἐστί</foreign>, &lsquo;the, what the thing really is&rsquo;. On the definition see Waitz, <hi rend="italic">Organ.</hi> II p. 398, and Trend. <hi rend="italic">El. Log. Ar.</hi> &sect; 54, et seq. This topic of definition afterwards became the <foreign lang="greek">στάσις ὁρική</foreign>, <hi rend="italic">nomen</hi> or <hi rend="italic">finitio;</hi> one of the legal &lsquo;issues&rsquo;, on which see Introduction, Appendix E to Bk III pp. 397&mdash;400. </p>

						<p>Top. VIII. <foreign lang="greek">ἐκ τοῦ ποσαχῶς</foreign>] Between the topics of definition and division (&sect; 10) is introduced this topic of ambiguous terms, or words <pb n="258"/> that are susceptible of many and various senses, such as <hi rend="italic">good</hi> (Top. A 15, 106 <hi rend="italic">a</hi> 4 [Grote's <hi rend="italic">Ar.</hi> I p. 402]); which must be carefully examined to see whether or no they are all of them applicable to the argument. It is treated at great length in Top. A 15, and again B 3; and is inserted <hi rend="italic">here</hi> (between definition and division) because it <hi rend="italic">is</hi> equally applicable to both (Brandis). The exhaustive treatment bestowed upon it in the Topics supersedes the necessity of dwelling on it here; and we are accordingly referred to that treatise for illustration of it. Brandis, u.s., p. 19, objects to <foreign lang="greek">περὶ τοῦ ὀρθῶς</foreign>, &ldquo;that there is nothing in the Topics which throws any light upon the enigmatical <foreign lang="greek">ὀρθῶς</foreign>;&rdquo; and proposes <foreign lang="greek">περὶ τοῦ εἰ ὀρθῶς</foreign> &lsquo;upon the right use of the terms&rsquo;, i. e. whether it can be applied properly in any one of its various senses or not. But surely the reading of the text may be interpreted as it stands in precisely the same meaning: <foreign lang="greek">οἷον ἐν τοπικοῖς</foreign> (<foreign lang="greek">λέλεκται</foreign>, or <foreign lang="greek">διώρισται</foreign>) <foreign lang="greek">περὶ τοῦ ὀρθῶς</foreign> (<foreign lang="greek">χρῆσθαι αὐτῷ</foreign>), &lsquo;as in the Topics (we have treated) of the right use of the terms&rsquo;. Muretus has omitted the words in his transl. as a gloss: and Victorius, followed by Schrader and Buhle, understands it as a reference, not directly to the Topics, but to the &lsquo;dialectical art&rsquo;, as elsewhere, II 22. 10, for instance&mdash; see Schrader's note on II 25. 3. &ldquo;Disciplina Topica intelligenda est.&rdquo; Buhle. It seems to me to be a <hi rend="italic">direct</hi> and explicit reference to the passages of the Topics above mentioned, in which the right way of dealing with these ambiguous terms is described. </p>

He therefore concludes by the method of exhaustion, that having no conceivable motives, he is not guilty. It must however be observed that Ar.'s <foreign lang="greek">διὰ δὲ τὸ τρίτον οὐδ’  αὐτοί φασιν</foreign>, is not supported by anything in Isocrates' text.

Gaisford quotes Homer, Od.

						<p>The meaning is, &lsquo;Another topic of inference is induction; as, for instance, it may be inferred as a general rule from the Peparethian case, that in the case of children (as to the true parentage of children) women always distinguish the truth better (than the other sex)&rsquo;. And the same rule has been applied, from a similar induction, in two other recorded cases; &lsquo;for, in the first, (on the one hand), at Athens, in a dispute in which Mantias the orator was engaged with his son (about his legitimacy), the mother declared the fact (of the birth, and so gained the cause for her child); and in the second, at Thebes, in a dispute between Ismenias and Stilbo (for the paternity of a child), Dodonis (the mother) <pb n="260"/> made a declaration that it belonged to Ismenias; and in consequence Thettaliscus was always regarded as Ismenias' son&rsquo;. </p>
						<p>&lsquo;Mantias the orator&rsquo;, whose name does not appear in Smith's <hi rend="italic">Biogr.

						<p>Ismenias, whose name likewise is wanting in Smith's <hi rend="italic">Dict.</hi>, was in all probability the one somewhat celebrated in Theban history, as leader, with Autoclides, of the anti-Lacedaemonian party at Thebes, mentioned by Xenophon, Hellen. V 2. 25 seq. He was accused by his opponent Leontiades, tried, and put to death by a court appointed for the purpose by the Lacedaemonians, who were then (383 B.

						<p>&lsquo;And another instance from Theodectes' &ldquo;law&rdquo;&mdash;if to those who have mismanaged other people's horses we don't entrust horses of our own, or (our ships) to those who have upset the ships of others; then, if the rule hold universally, those who have ill guarded or maintained the safety and well-being of others, are not to be employed in (entrusted with) the preservation of our own&rsquo;. Sauppe, Fragm. Theod. <foreign lang="greek">Νόμος</foreign> (<hi rend="italic">Or. Att.</hi> III <pb n="261"/> 247), thinks with every appearance of probability that Theodectes' &lsquo;law&rsquo; &ldquo;(<hi rend="italic">declamationem</hi>) ad rationes militum mercenariorum lege ab Atheniensibus accurate ordinandas pertinuisse.&rdquo; Both the fragments quoted by Aristotle, here, and again &sect; 17, agree perfectly with this view. The extract here stigmatizes the folly shewn by the Athenians in entrusting their interests to mercenaries&mdash;like Charidemus and his fellows&mdash;who have already shewn their incapacity and untrustworthiness whilst in the employment of others&mdash;foreign princes and states&mdash;who have used their services. The other extract, &sect; 17, is to shew that by their gross misconduct and the mischief they have already done, most of them&mdash;with the exception perhaps of men like Strabax and Charidemus&mdash;have entirely disqualified themselves for employment. From the example in Theodectes' &lsquo;law&rsquo;, the <hi rend="italic">general principle</hi> may be inferred, that it is folly to entrust with the care of our own interests and the management of our affairs such as have already shewn themselves incapable by previous failures in like cases. The argument from the analogy of trades and professions is quite in the manner of Socrates and Plato. </p>

In favour of this, <pb n="262"/> the reading of the best MS, it may be urged, that <foreign lang="greek">πολίτην</foreign> would represent the Chians as <hi rend="italic">disclaiming</hi> Homer as their fellow-citizen, quite contrary to the pertinacity with which they ordinarily urged their claim to the honour of his birthplace. This was carried so far, that Simonides in one of his fragments, Eleg. Fragm. 85 line 2 (Bergk), says of a quotation from Homer, <foreign lang="greek">Χῖος ἔειπεν ἀνήρ</foreign>. Comp. Thucyd. III 104. On this &lsquo;Ionic&rsquo; claim, see further in Mure, <hi rend="italic">Hist. Gk. Lit.</hi> Vol. II p. 202.

The other reading <foreign lang="greek">πολιτικόν</foreign> affords an equally good sense; that his Chian fellow-countrymen conferred honours upon Homer, though not upon the ordinary ground of public services, or active participation in the business of public life; as the Athenians&mdash;had they so pleased&mdash;might have dealt with Plato. </p>

Victorius remarks that these are properly distinguished from <foreign lang="greek">Ἰταλοί</foreign>, the original inhabitants, who would not have understood Pythagoras' learning, or institutions, or moral precepts. </p>
						<p><hi rend="italic">Pythagoras</hi>, according to the received account, as reported by Diogenes Laertius, vit. Pyth., was a native of Samos, to which after various travels he was returning, when, finding it oppressed by the tyranny of Polycrates, he started for Croton in Italy; <foreign lang="greek">κἀκεῖ νόμους θεὶς τοῖς Ἰταλιώταις ἐδοξάσθη σὺν τοῖς μαθηταῖς, οἳ πρὸς τοὺς τριακοσίους ὄντες ᾠκονόμουν ἄριστα τὰ πολιτικά, ὥστε σχεδὸν ἀριστοκρατίαν εἶναι τὴν πολιτείαν</foreign>, &sect; 3. In what way the honour of his new fellow-citizens was expressed rather by respect and admiration, than by substantial rewards, may be gathered from the famous <foreign lang="greek">αὐτὸς ἔφα</foreign> of his pupils, and from a notice in Diogenes, &sect; 14, <foreign lang="greek">οὕτω δ’  ἐθαυμάσθη κ.τ.λ.</foreign> </p>

Accordingly Bekker, Ed. 3, Spengel and Vahlen now read <foreign lang="greek">ὅτι Ἀθ</foreign>. preceded by the mark of something omitted. And in fact, as Spengel observes, what follows is not a proper continuation of the preceding quotation from Alcidamas, but a new example of the general topic of induction. The general rule which is derived from the two following instances has fallen out, or something suggesting it, to which <foreign lang="greek">ὅτι</foreign> refers, has been omitted either by a copyist, or possibly in his haste by the author himself. Aristotle is capable of this; continuing perhaps to quote from Alcidamas, he may have neglected to supply the proper connexion. The general principle that is to be inferred from the induction may be the Platonic paradox that the true statesmen are philosophers: this appears from the three examples, &lsquo;that the Athenians flourished and were happy under the laws of Solon, and the Lacedaemonians under those of Lycurgus; and at Thebes, the prosperity (or flourishing condition) of the city was coeval with the accession of its leaders to philosophy&rsquo;. I have rendered the last words thus to express <foreign lang="greek">ἐγένοντο</foreign>. But the meaning of the whole is doubtless as Victorius gives it, that the happiness of Thebes, that is, its virtue and glory, began and ended with the philosophy of its leaders. This is inadequately expressed by <foreign lang="greek">ἐγένοντο</foreign>, which only conveys the beginning of the coincidence: and, if the explanation of the suppressed rule be right, would have been better represented by <foreign lang="greek">ἅμα οἱ φιλόσοφοι προστάται ἐγένοντο</foreign>. The last word is a correction of Victorius from MS A^{c} for the <hi rend="italic">vulgata lectio</hi> <foreign lang="greek">ἐλέγοντο</foreign>. (The leaders here referred to are Epaminondas and Pelopidas.) </p>

						<p>&lsquo;An instance of this is what Autocles said in his speech on the prosecution of Mixidemides&rsquo; (this is lit. &lsquo;as Aut. said, what he <hi rend="italic">did</hi> say against M.&rsquo;)&rsquo; &lsquo;that&rsquo; (before <foreign lang="greek">εἰ</foreign> supply <foreign lang="greek">δεινὸν εἶναι</foreign> <hi rend="italic">aut tale aliquid</hi>, &lsquo;it was monstrous that, to think that&rsquo;&mdash;) &lsquo;the dread goddesses&rsquo; (the Eumenides or Erinnyes) &lsquo;should be satisfied to bring their case<note anchored="yes" n="2"><foreign lang="greek">δίκην δοῦναι</foreign> is here, as in Thuc.

						<p>The appearance of the <foreign lang="greek">σεμναὶ θεαί</foreign> as prosecutors in the court of the Areopagus is of course a reference to their prosecution of Orestes in Aeschylus' Eumenides. Of Mixidemides we know but the name. Autocles was a much more important personage. He was an Athenian, son of Strombichides, Xen. Hellen. VI 3. 2, one of the seven ambassadors sent to the congress at Sparta in 371 B.C., in the spring before the battle of Leuctra, Xen. l. c., who reports his speech &sect; 7. Xenophon (u. s. &sect; 7) calls him <foreign lang="greek">μάλα ἐπιστρεφὴς ῥήτωρ</foreign>, &lsquo;a very careful orator&rsquo; (so Sturz, Lex. Xen. and Lexx. but I think rather, &lsquo;dexterous&rsquo;, one who could readily <hi rend="italic">turn himself about</hi> to anything, &lsquo;versatile&rsquo;: and so apparently Suidas, who renders it <foreign lang="greek">ἀγχίνους</foreign>). Autocles was again employed in 362&mdash;361 &ldquo;in place of Ergophilus (Rhet. II 3. 13) to carry on war for Athens in the Hellespont and Bosporus.&rdquo; (Grote.) Xenophon's Hellenics do not reach this date. His operations against Cotys in the Chersonese, and subsequent trial, are mentioned by Demosth. c. Aristocr. &sect; 104 and c. Polycl. &sect; 12, and his name occurs, pro Phorm. &sect; 53 [A. Schaefer's <hi rend="italic">Dem. u. s. Zeit</hi> I pp. 64, 134 and III 2. p. 158]. See Grote, <hi rend="italic">H. G.</hi> X 223 [c. LXXVII], and 511 seq. [c. LXXX]. Another Autocles, <foreign lang="greek">ὁ Τολμαίου</foreign>, is mentioned by Thuc. IV 53, and again c. 119: and another by Lysias, <foreign lang="greek">πρὸς Σίμωνα</foreign> &sect; 12: and a fourth by Aeschines, de F. Leg. &sect; 155. </p>
						<p>&lsquo;Or (another example) Sappho's saying, that death must be an evil: for the gods have so decided; else they would have died themselves&rsquo;: using the gods as an <hi rend="italic">authority</hi> for the truth of her dictum. </p>
						<p>&lsquo;Or again, as Aristippus to Plato, when he pronounced upon some point in&mdash;as he, Aristippus, thought&mdash;a somewhat too authoritative tone, &ldquo;Nay but,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;our friend&rdquo;&mdash;meaning Socrates&mdash;&ldquo;never used to speak like that.&rdquo;&rsquo; </p>
						<p>Aristippus draws an inference from the <hi rend="italic">authority</hi> of their common master&mdash;who never dictated, but left every question open to free discussion, always assuming his own ignorance, and desire to be instructed rather than to instruct&mdash;to the proper rule in conducting philosophical discussion. On Aristippus see Grote's Plato, Vol. III. p. 530, seq. ch. XXXVIII. </p>
						<p>On this passage, see Grote, Plato, III 471, and note. In qualification of what is there said of Plato's &lsquo;arrogance&rsquo;, so far as it can be gathered <pb n="266"/> from our text, take Victorius' commentary on <foreign lang="greek">ὡς ᾤετο</foreign>, with which I entirely agree: &ldquo;quae sequuntur verba modestiam Platonis defendunt, et paene declarant sine causa Aristippum arrogantiae eum insumulasse: addit enim <foreign lang="greek">ὡς ᾤετο</foreign>, ut opinio illius erat.&rdquo; I will not however deny that Plato may even in conversation have been occasionally guilty of dogmatizing: in his latest writings, such as the Timaeus and Laws, and to a less degree in the Republic, such a tendency undoubtedly shews itself: but by far the larger portion of his dialogues, which represent probably nearly three-fourths of his entire life, are pervaded by a directly opposite spirit, and are the very impersonation of intellectual freedom. Following the method and practice of his master, he submits every question as it arises to the freest dialectical discussion, so that it is often impossible to decide which way (at the period of writing any particular dialogue) his own opinion inclines; and always presents in the strongest light any objections and difficulties in the thesis which he is maintaining. I think at all events with Victorius that Aristotle at any rate lends no countenance here to Aristippus' charge of dogmatic assumption. So far as his outward bearing and demeanour were concerned, I can conceive that he may have been haughty and reserved, possibly even morose: but a habit of &lsquo;laying down the law&rsquo;, or of undue assumption and pretension in lecturing and discussion&mdash;which is what Aristippus appears here to attribute to him&mdash;seems to me to be inconsistent with what we known from his dialogues to have been the ordinary habit of his mind, at least until he was already advanced in life<note anchored="yes">I have expressed my opinion upon some points of Plato's character, in contrast with that of Aristotle, in Introd. to transl. of Gorgias p. xxvii, and note; to which I venture here to refer.</note>. </p>
						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ἐπαγγελτικώτερον] ἐπαγγέλλεσθαι</lemma> is to &lsquo;announce&rsquo;, &lsquo;make public profession of&rsquo;, as of an art, pursuit, business, practice. Xen. Memor. I 2. 7, <foreign lang="greek">ἐπ’  ἀρετήν</foreign>, of the Sophists, who &lsquo;made a profession of teaching virtue&rsquo;. So <foreign lang="greek">Πρωταγόρου ἐπάγγελμα</foreign>, Rhet. II 24. 11. This &lsquo;profession&rsquo; may or may not carry with it the notion of pretension without performance, imposture, sham, <foreign lang="greek">φαινομένη σοφία</foreign>, show without substance: and it is by the context and the other associations that the particular meaning must be determined. Thus when Protagoras says of himself, <foreign lang="greek">τοῦτό ἐστιν, ὦ Σ., τὸ ἐπάγγελμα ὃ ἐπαγγέλλομαι</foreign>, he certainly does not mean to imply that he is an impostor: when Aristotle l. c. applies the term to him, this is by no means so certain; judging by his account of the Sophists, de Soph. El. I, 165 <hi rend="italic">a</hi> 19 seq. Instances of both usages may be found in Ast, Lex. Plat. There can be no doubt that undue <hi rend="italic">assumption</hi> or pretension is meant to be conveyed by Aristippus in applying the word to Plato's tone and manner. </p>
						<p>&lsquo;And Agesipolis repeated the inquiry of the God at Delphi, which he had previously made (of the God) at Olympia (Apollo at Delphi, Zeus at Olympia), whether his opinion coincided with his father's; <pb n="267"/> assuming or inferring&rsquo; (<foreign lang="greek">ὡς</foreign> sc. from the obvious duty of respecting the authority of a father) &lsquo;the disgracefulness of pronouncing the contrary&rsquo;. </p>
						<p>For v. l. <foreign lang="greek">Ἡγήσιππος</foreign> Victorius and Muretus had proposed to substitute <foreign lang="greek">Ἀγησίπολις</foreign>, from Xen. Hellen. IV 7. 2, which has been adopted in the recent editions of Bekker and Spengel; being also confirmed by a variation in the old Latin Transl., which has <hi rend="italic">Hegesippus polis.</hi> See Spengel in <hi rend="italic">Trans. Bav. Acad.</hi> 1851, p. 53. Gaisford in <hi rend="italic">Not. Var.</hi> and Victorius. Xenophon in the passage cited tells the whole story. Agesipolis is the first of the three kings of Sparta of that name, who came to the throne in 394 B.C. (Clinton, <hi rend="italic">F. H.</hi> II p. 205). His expedition into Argolis, to which the consultation of the oracle was preparatory, was in 390 (Clinton, <hi rend="italic">F. H. sub anno</hi>). This Agesipolis has been not unnaturally confounded with his more distinguished fellow-citizen and contemporary Agesilaus, to whom Plutarch, Reg. et Imper. Apophthegm., Agesilaus 7, p. 191 B, erroneously ascribes this saying as an <hi rend="italic">apophthegm</hi> (Gaisford). And similarly Diodorus, XIV 97, has substituted the latter name for the former in his account of (apparently) the same event that Xenophon is relating in the passage above cited. See Schneider's note <hi rend="italic">ad locum.</hi> </p>
						<p>&lsquo;And Isocrates&rsquo; argument about Helen, to shew that she was virtuous and respectable, (as she must have been) since (<foreign lang="greek">εἴπερ</foreign>, if&mdash;as he <hi rend="italic">did</hi>) she was approved by Theseus (Theseus decided, or gave judgment in her favour)&rsquo;. Aristotle's <foreign lang="greek">ἔκρινεν</foreign> expresses Isocrates' <foreign lang="greek">ἀγαπήσαντας καὶ θαυμάσαντας</foreign>. See <hi rend="italic">ante</hi>, I 6. 25. The passage of Isocrates referred to occurs in his Helen &sect;&sect; 18&mdash;22. Compare especially &sect;&sect; 21, 22. He concludes thus, <foreign lang="greek">περὶ δὲ τῶν οὕτω παλαιῶν προσήκει τοῖς κατ’  ἐκεῖνον τὸν χρόνον εὖ φρονήσασιν ὁμονοοῦντας ἡμᾶς φαίνεσθαι</foreign>, to give way to their <hi rend="italic">authority.</hi> </p>
						<p>&lsquo;And the case of Alexander (Paris) whom the (three) goddesses (Juno, Minerva, Venus) preferred&rsquo; (selected, decided, by preference; <foreign lang="greek">πρό</foreign>, before all others; to adjudge the prize of beauty). This instance is given before, with the preceding, in I 6. 25. </p>
						<p>&lsquo;And&mdash;as Isocrates says, to prove that (<foreign lang="greek">ὅτι</foreign>) Evagoras was a man of worth&mdash;Conon, at all events after his misfortune, left all the rest and came to Evagoras&rsquo;. Evagoras, the subject of Isocrates' panegyric, Or. IX, was king of Salamis in Cyprus. In the spring of 404 B.C., after the defeat of Aegospotami (<foreign lang="greek">δυστυχήσας</foreign>), he fled for refuge to Evagoras, Xen. Hellen. II 1. 29; the words <foreign lang="greek">δυστυχήσας ὡς Εὐαγόραν ἦλθε</foreign> are a direct quotation from the Oration, &sect; 52. This incident of Conon's <hi rend="italic">forced</hi> visit is absurdly embellished, exaggerated, and distorted from its true significance by the voluble panegyrist, &sect; 51 seq. <pb n="268"/> </p>

						<p>Top. XII. <foreign lang="greek">ἐκ τῶν μερῶν</foreign>] the argument from the parts to the whole. This topic, so briefly dispatched here, is much more clearly and fully set forth in the Topics, B 4, 111 <hi rend="italic">a</hi> 33 seq. [Grote's <hi rend="italic">Ar.</hi> I p. 417], to which we are referred; the same example being given in both. The parts and whole, are the species and genus. Anything of which the genus or whole can be predicated must likewise fall under one of its species, because the species taken together make up the genus; if knowledge for instance be predicable of something, then some one of its parts or branches&mdash;grammar, music or some other species of knowledge&mdash;must needs be predicable of the same; otherwise it is no part of knowledge. And the same applies to the declensions&mdash;<foreign lang="greek">παρωνύμως λεγόμενα</foreign>, the same root or notion with altered terminations&mdash;of the words representing the genus; what is true of <foreign lang="greek">ἐπιστήμη</foreign> &amp;c. is equally true of <foreign lang="greek">ἐπιστήμων, γραμματικός, μουσικός</foreign>. If then all the parts of the genus are or can be known (this is assumed in the text), we have to consider when any thesis is proposed, such as, the soul is in motion (<foreign lang="greek">τὴν ψυχὴν κινεῖσθαι</foreign>, meaning, that the soul <hi rend="italic">is</hi> motion), what the kinds of motion are, and whether the soul is capable of being moved in any of them; if not, we <hi rend="italic">infer</hi>, &lsquo;from part to whole&rsquo;, that the genus motion is <hi rend="italic">not</hi> predicable of soul, or that the soul is devoid of motion. </p>
						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">κίνησις</lemma> is usually divided by Aristotle into four kinds, (1) <foreign lang="greek">φορά</foreign>, motion of translation, motion proper; (2) <foreign lang="greek">ἀλλοίωσις</foreign>, alteration; (3) <foreign lang="greek">αὔξησις</foreign>, growth; and (4) <foreign lang="greek">φθίσις</foreign>, decay.

These are his examples. <hi rend="italic">Ut sit civis aut natus sit oportet, aut factus: utrumque tollendum est, nec natus nec factus est.</hi> Ib. <hi rend="italic">Hic servus quem tibi vindicas, aut verna tuus est, aut emptus, aut donatus, aut testamento relictus, aut ex hoste captus, aut alienus: deinde remotis prioribus supererit</hi> alienus.

						<p>&lsquo;Example from Theodectes' Socrates: &ldquo;What temple has he profaned? To which of the gods that the city believes in (recognises, accepts) has he failed to pay the honour due?&rdquo;&rsquo; The phrase <foreign lang="greek">ἀσεβεῖν εἰς τὸ ἱερὸν τὸ ἐν Δελφοῖς</foreign> occurs twice (as Victorius notes) in Aesch. c. Ctes. &sect;&sect; 106, 107. Theodectes' &ldquo;Socrates,&rdquo; which is (most probably) quoted again without the author's name &sect; 18, was one of the numerous <foreign lang="greek">ἀπολογίαι Σωκράτους</foreign> of which those of Plato and Xenophon alone are still in existence. We read also (Isocr. Busiris &sect; 4) of a paradoxical <foreign lang="greek">κατηγορία Σωκράτους</foreign> by Polycrates (one of the early Sophistical Rhetoricians, Spengel <hi rend="italic">Art. Script.</hi> pp. 75&mdash;7. <hi rend="italic">Camb. Journ. of Cl. and Sacred Phil.</hi> No. IX vol. III 281&mdash;2), which was answered by an <foreign lang="greek">ἀπολογία Σωκράτους</foreign> from Lysias, Speng. op. cit. p. 141. On this see Sauppe, Lys. Fragm. CXIII <hi rend="italic">Or. Att.</hi> III 204: which is to be distinguished from another and earlier one, also by Lysias Sauppe, u. s. Fr. CXII p. 203. [Blass, <hi rend="italic">Att.

						<p>Theodectes is here answering the charge of Meletus, <foreign lang="greek">οὓς μὲν ἡ πόλις νομίζει θεοὺς οὐ νομίζων</foreign>, Xen. Mem. I 1. 1, Apol. Socr. &sect; 11, Plat. Ap. Socr. 26 B. To this Xenophon, like Theodectes, replies by a direct contradiction, and affirmation of the contrary, Mem. I 1. 2, <foreign lang="greek">θύων τε γὰρ φανερὸς ἦν, κ.τ.λ.</foreign> comp. &sect; 20; and sim. Apol. Socr. &sect; 11 seq. How the charge is met by Plato in his Apology cc. XIV, XV, and dialectically argued, has been already intimated, <hi rend="italic">supra</hi> &sect; 8,&mdash;see note, and comp. III 18. 2. The difference of the mode of treatment severally adopted by the two disciples in the defence of their master is remarkable. The <hi rend="italic">inference</hi> implied in Theod.'s argument is this:&mdash;You accuse Socrates of impiety and disbelief in the gods. Has he ever profaned a temple? Has he neglected to worship them and do them honour, by sacrifice and other outward observances? The indignant question, implying that the speaker defies the other to contradict him and prove his charge, assumes the negative. But such offences as these are the <hi rend="italic">parts</hi> of impiety which indicate disbelief in the gods&mdash;the orator in his excitement takes for granted that the enumeration is complete, that there is nothing else which could prove disbelief in the gods&mdash;and if he is not guilty of any of them, neither can he be guilty of the impiety which includes these, and these alone, as its parts; the whole or genus is <hi rend="italic">not</hi> predicable of him<note anchored="yes">This argument may possibly be suitable to a sophist and declaimer, but the use of it in a court of justice would certainly be exposed to the &lsquo;danger&rsquo; against which Quintilian warns those who employ the topic in general.</note>. <pb n="270"/> </p>
						<p>&sect;&sect; 14, 15. Top. XIII. <hi rend="italic">Argumentum ex consequentibus;</hi> <foreign lang="greek">ἐκ τῶν ἑπομένων τινὶ ἀγαθῶν ἢ κακῶν</foreign>, which Vict. found <hi rend="italic">as a title</hi> to the topic in one of his MSS. On <foreign lang="greek">ἕπεσθαι</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">ἀκολουθεῖν</foreign>, and their various senses, dialectical and in the ordinary language, see note on I 6. 3. The general meaning of them seems to be &lsquo;concomitant&rsquo;; that which constantly waits or attends upon something, either as antecedent, simultaneous, or subsequent. </p>
						<p>There are two topics of consequents, XIII and XIV. The first is simple. Most things have some good and some bad consequent usually or inseparably attached to them, as wisdom and the envy of fellow-citizens are the ordinary results of education. In exhortation, defence, and encomium (the three branches of Rhetoric) we urge the favourable consequence&mdash;the resulting wisdom in the case proposed&mdash;if we have to dissuade, to accuse, to censure, the unfavourable; each as the occasion may require. The second is somewhat more complex. Here we have two opposites (<foreign lang="greek">περὶ δυοῖν καὶ ἀντικειμένοιν</foreign>) to deal with&mdash;in the example public speaking falls into the two alternatives of true and fair speaking, and false and unfair. These are to be treated &lsquo;in the way before mentioned&rsquo;, <foreign lang="greek">τῷ πρότερον εἰρημένῳ τρόπῳ</foreign>: that is, in exhorting or recommending we take the favourable consequent, in dissuading the unfavourable. But the difference between the two topics lies in this (<foreign lang="greek">διαφέρει δέ</foreign>); that in the former the opposition (that must be the opposition of the good and bad consequent, for there is no other) is <hi rend="italic">accidental</hi>&mdash;that is, as appears in the example, there is no relation or logical connexion between wisdom and envy; they may be compared in respect of their value and importance as motives to action, but are not logical opposites&mdash;but in the latter, the good and the bad consequences are two contraries (<foreign lang="greek">τἀναντία</foreign>) love and hatred, divine and human. In the example of the second topic, the dissuasive argument which comes first assigns evil consequences (<hi rend="italic">hatred</hi>) to both alternatives of public speaking: that in recommendation, the contrary, <hi rend="italic">love.</hi> The topic of consequences, in the general sense, as above explained, has been already applied in estimating the value of goods <hi rend="italic">absolute</hi>, I 6.3; and in the comparison of good things, I 7.5. In Dialectics it does not appear in this simple shape, though it is virtually contained in the application of it to the four modes of <foreign lang="greek">ἀντίθεσις</foreign> or opposition, Top. B 8; and in the <hi rend="italic">comparison</hi> of two good things, Top. <foreign lang="greek">Γ</foreign> 2, 117 <hi rend="italic">a</hi> 5&mdash;15. Brandis u. s. [<hi rend="italic">Philologus</hi> IV 1] observes of the two Rhetorical topics, that they could not find an independent place and treatment in the Topics. </p>
						<p>Cicero speaks of the general topic of consequence <hi rend="italic">dialecticorum proprius ex consequentibus antecedentibus et repugnantibus</hi>, omitting the <pb n="271"/> simple form in which it appears in Rhetoric. His <hi rend="italic">consequentia</hi> are <hi rend="italic">necessary</hi> concomitants, <hi rend="italic">quae rem necessario consequuntur.</hi> Top. XII 53. The mode of handling it is illustrated, XIII 53. </p>
						<p>Quint. V 10. 74, Ex consequentibus <hi rend="italic">sive</hi> adiunctis; <hi rend="italic">Si est bonum iustitia, recte iudicandum: si malum perfidia, non est fallendum. Idem retro.</hi> &sect; 75, <hi rend="italic">sed haec</hi> consequentia <hi rend="italic">dico</hi>, <foreign lang="greek">ἀκολουθά</foreign>; <hi rend="italic">est enim consequens</hi> (in Cicero's sense) <hi rend="italic">sapientiae bonitas; illa</hi> sequentia, <foreign lang="greek">παρεπόμενα</foreign>, <hi rend="italic">quae postea facta sunt aut futura.</hi> And two other examples of the application of the argument, &sect;&sect; 76, 77. Quintilian naturally, like Aristotle, gives only the rhetorical, and omits the dialectical use of the topic. </p>
						<p>Note by the way the redundant <foreign lang="greek">ὥστε</foreign> in <foreign lang="greek">συμβαίνει ὥσθ’  ἕπεσθαι</foreign>. See Monk on Eur. Hippol. 1323, <foreign lang="greek">Κύπρις γὰρ ἤθελ’  ὥστε γίγνεσθαι τάδε</foreign>. And add to the examples there given, Thuc. I 119, <foreign lang="greek">δεηθέντες ὥστε ψηφ</foreign>., VIII 45, <foreign lang="greek">ἐδίδασκεν ὥστε</foreign>, Ib. 79, <foreign lang="greek">δόξαν ὥστε διαναομαχεῖν</foreign> Ib. 86, <foreign lang="greek">ἐπαγγελλόμενοι ὥστε βοηθεῖν</foreign>.

						<p>The example of Top. is taken from the passage of Eur. Med. 294, already employed in illustration of a <foreign lang="greek">γνώμη</foreign>, II 21. 2. Education of children has for its inseparable attendants wisdom or learning as a good, and the envy of one's fellow-citizens as an evil: we may therefore take our choice between them, and argue either for or against it, persuading or dissuading. (Note a good instance of <foreign lang="greek">μὲν οὖν</foreign>, as a negative (usually) corrective, &lsquo;nay rather&rsquo;; this of course comes from the opponent who is arguing on the other side, that education is advantageous. Also in &sect; 15.) </p>
						<p>&lsquo;The illustration of this topic constitutes the entire art of Callippus&mdash; with the addition (no doubt) of the possible, (the <foreign lang="greek">κοινὸς τόπος</foreign> of that name,) and all the rest (of the <foreign lang="greek">κοινοὶ τόποι</foreign>, three in number), as has been said&rsquo;, in c. 19, namely. </p>
						<p>The two notices of Callippus and his art of Rhetoric in this passage and &sect; 21, are all that is known to us of that rhetorician. He is not to be confounded with the Callippus mentioned in I 12. 29. Spengel, <hi rend="italic">Art. Script.</hi> 148&mdash;9, contents himself with quoting the two passages of this chapter on the subject. He was one of the early writers on the art of Rhetoric; and it is possible that a person of that name referred to by <pb n="272"/> Isocrates&mdash;who was born in 436 B. C.&mdash;as one of his <hi rend="italic">first</hi> pupils, <foreign lang="greek">περὶ ἀντιδόσεως</foreign> &sect; 93, may have been this same Rhetorician Callippus. </p>

						<p>Tiresias, ap. Phoen. 968, <foreign lang="greek">ὅστις δ’  ἐμπύρῳ χρῆται τέχνῃ μάταιος· ἢν μὲν ἐχθρὰ σημῄνας τύχῃ, πικρὸς καθέστηχ̓ οἷς ἂν οἰωνοσκοπῇ. ψευδῆ δ̓ ὑπ̓ οἴκτου τοῖσι χρωμένοις λέγων ἀδικεῖ τὰ τῶν θεῶν</foreign>, is compared by Victorius<note anchored="yes">Gaisford, <hi rend="italic">Not. Var.</hi>, cites this as from Victorius. It is not found in my copy, Florence, 1548.</note> with the example in the second topic. </p>
						<p>This second topic of consequences differs from the preceding in these particulars. In the first, which is simple, the consequences of the thing which is in question are twofold&mdash;bad and good, and these are unconnected by any reciprocal relation between them. The second is more complicated, and offers contrary alternatives, which are set in opposition <foreign lang="greek">ἀντιτίθεται τἀναντία</foreign>, as <foreign lang="greek">δίκαια</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">ἄδικα λέγειν</foreign> in the example&mdash;and then, &lsquo;proceed as before&rsquo;, <foreign lang="greek">τῷ πρότερον εἰρημένῳ τρόπῳ</foreign>; that is, state the consequence of each, (favourable in exhortation or recommendation, unfavourable in dissuasion,) and bring the two into comparison in order to strike the balance of advantage or disadvantage between them. In public speaking, for instance, the alternatives are, true and fair, and false and unfair, words and arguments: if your object is to dissuade from it, you adduce the ill consequences of both, and contrast them, so as to shew which is the greater. </p>
						<p>&lsquo;But that is all one with the proverb, to buy the marsh with the salt&rsquo;: i. e. to take the fat with the lean; the bad with the good; the unprofitable and unwholesome marsh (<hi rend="italic">palus inamabilis</hi>, Virg. G. IV 479, Aen. VI 438) with the profitable salt which is inseparably connected with it. An argument pro and con, but only of the first kind, Top. XIII, by comparing the good and the bad consequence, according as you are for or against the purchase. An Italian proverb to the same effect is quoted in Buhle's note, <hi rend="italic">comprare il mel con le mosche;</hi> and the opposite, the good <hi rend="italic">without</hi> the bad, appears in the Latin, <hi rend="italic">sine sacris haereditas</hi>, Plaut. Capt. IV 1. 5 (Schrad.). [We may also contrast the proverb <foreign lang="greek">μηδὲ μέλι, μηδὲ μελίσσας</foreign>: <foreign lang="greek">ἐπὶ τῶν μὴ βουλομένων παθεῖν τι ἀγαθὸν μετὰ ἀπευκτοῦ</foreign> (Diogenianus, <hi rend="italic">cent.</hi> vi, 58). Cf. Sappho, fragm. 113.] <pb n="273"/> </p>
						<p>There is an evident intention in the association of <foreign lang="greek">ἕλος</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">ἅλας</foreign>: the alliterative jingle, as in so many other proverbs (<foreign lang="greek">παθήματα μαθήματα</foreign>, safe bind safe find), sharpens the point, and helps its hold on the memory. </p>
						<p>Some MSS have <foreign lang="greek">ἔλαιον</foreign> for <foreign lang="greek">ἕλος</foreign>, which is expressed in the Vet. Tr. Lat., &lsquo;olim (oleum) emi et sales,&rsquo; and by other interpreters; and also adopted by Erasmus, <hi rend="italic">Adag.</hi>, oleum et salem oportet emere; &lsquo;to be in want of oil and salt,&rsquo; implying insanity, against which this mixture was supposed to be a specific. Victorius, referring to the Schol. on Arist. Nub. 1237, <foreign lang="greek">ἁλσὶν διασμηχθεὶς ὄναιτ’  ἂν οὑτοσί</foreign>, who notes <foreign lang="greek">τοὺς παραφρονοῦντας ἁλσὶ καὶ ἐλαίῳ διέβρεχον, καὶ ὠφελοῦντο</foreign>, supposes that some copyist having this in his mind altered <foreign lang="greek">ἕλος</foreign> into <foreign lang="greek">ἔλαιον</foreign>. At all events the proverb in this interpretation has no meaning or applicability here. </p>
						<p>In the following paragraph (<foreign lang="greek">καὶ ἡ βλαίσωσις...ἑκατέροις</foreign>) the meaning of <foreign lang="greek">βλαίσωσις</foreign>, the application of the metaphor, and its connexion with what follows, which appears to be intended as an exemplification or explanation of the use of <foreign lang="greek">βλαίσωσις</foreign>, are, and are likely to remain, alike unintelligible. The Commentators and Lexicographers are equally at fault; Spengel in his recent commentary passes the passage over in absolute silence: Victorius, who reasonably supposes that <foreign lang="greek">βλαίσωσις</foreign> (metaphorically) represents some figure of rhetorical argument, candidly admits that nothing whatsoever is known of its meaning and use, and affords no help either in the explanation of the metaphor, or its connexion with what seems to be the interpretation of it. Buhle, and W. Dindorf, ap. Steph. <hi rend="italic">Thes.</hi> s. v. <hi rend="italic">praevaricatio;</hi> Vet. Lat. Tr. <hi rend="italic">claudicatio;</hi> Riccoboni <hi rend="italic">inversio.</hi> Vater discreetly says nothing; and Schrader that which amounts to nothing. After all these failures I cannot hope for any better success; and I will merely offer a few remarks upon the passage, with a view to assist others as far as I can in their search for a solution. </p>
						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">βλαισός</lemma> and <foreign lang="greek">ῥαιβός</foreign>, <hi rend="italic">valgus</hi> and <hi rend="italic">varus</hi>, all of them express a deformity or divergence from the right line, or standard shape, in the legs and feet. The first (which is not always explained in the same way<note anchored="yes"><foreign lang="greek">βλαισός</foreign>...bandy-legged, <hi rend="italic">opposed to</hi> <foreign lang="greek">ῥαιβός. ῥαιβός</foreign>, crooked, bent, <hi rend="italic">esp. of</hi> bandy legs. Liddell and Scott's Lex. sub vv.</note>) seems to correspond to our &lsquo;bow-legged&rsquo;, that is having the leg and foot bent outwards: for it was applied to the hind legs of frogs, <foreign lang="greek">βλαισοπόδης βάτραχος</foreign>, poet. ap. Suidam. And Etym. M. (conf. Poll. 2. 193,) interprets it, <foreign lang="greek">ὁ τοὺς πόδας εἰς τὰ ἔξω διεστραμμένος</foreign> (with his feet distorted so as to turn outwards) <foreign lang="greek">καὶ τῷ Λ στοιχείῳ ἐοικώς</foreign>; so that it seems that it may represent the act of straddling. The adj. itself and some derivatives not unfrequently occur in Ar.'s works on Nat. Hist.; likewise in Galen, once in Xenophon, de re Eq. I 3, and, rarely in other authors; but <foreign lang="greek">βλαίσωσις</foreign> appears to be a <foreign lang="greek">ἅπαξ λεγόμενον. ῥαιβός</foreign> is the opposite defect to this, &lsquo;bandy-legged&rsquo;, where the legs turn inwards. And to these correspond <hi rend="italic">valgus</hi> and <hi rend="italic">varus:</hi> the first, <hi rend="italic">qui suras et crura habet extrorsum intortas</hi>, of which Petronius says, <hi rend="italic">crura in orbem pandit;</hi> and Martial, <hi rend="italic">crura... simulant quae cornua lunae.</hi> Huic contrarius est <hi rend="italic">varus</hi>, qui introrsus <pb n="274"/> pedes et crura obtorta habet. &ldquo;Vari dicuntur incurva crura habentes.&rdquo; Festus (ap. Facc.). Heindorf ad Hor. Sat. I. 3, 47. G. Dindorf (in Steph. <hi rend="italic">Thes.</hi>) explains it by <hi rend="italic">praevaricatio</hi>, quoting Cic. Orat. Partit. XXXVI 126, (praevaricator definitur) <hi rend="italic">ex nomine ipso, quod significat eum qui in contrariis caussis quasi vare</hi> (Edd. varie) <hi rend="italic">esse positus videatur</hi><note anchored="yes">Compare the whole passage &sect;&sect; 124&mdash;126, in illustration of <hi rend="italic">praevaricatio.</hi></note>. If we revert to the derivation, and apparently the original meaning, of the word, following Cicero, and understand it as &lsquo;a deviation from the right&rsquo; course or path, by a metaphor from bent or distorted legs, <hi rend="italic">praevaricatio</hi> might be taken as expressing by a similar metaphor the general meaning of <foreign lang="greek">βλαίσωσις</foreign>; but in its ordinary acceptation of &lsquo;the betrayal of his client by an advocate, and collusion with his opponent&rsquo;&mdash;in which Buhle and the Translators must be supposed to understand it, since they offer no other explanation&mdash;it seems altogether inappropriate. So however Rost and Palm, in their <hi rend="italic">Lexicon.</hi> </p>
						<p>The translation, as the passage stands, is &lsquo;and the <foreign lang="greek">βλαίσωσις</foreign> is, or consists in, this, when each (either) of two contraries is followed (accompanied) by a good and an ill consequence, each contrary to each&rsquo;, (as in a proposition of Euclid). This is a generalisation of the example in Top. XIV: the two contraries are the fair and unfair speaking; each of which has its favourable and unfavourable consequence; truth, the love of God and hatred of men; falsehood, the love of men and hatred of God. But how this is connected with <foreign lang="greek">βλαίσωσις</foreign> I confess myself unable to discover. The nearest approach I have been able to make to it&mdash;which I only mention to condemn&mdash;is to understand <foreign lang="greek">βλαίσωσις</foreign> of the <hi rend="italic">straddling</hi> of the legs, the <foreign lang="greek">Λ</foreign> of the Etymol. M., which might possibly represent the <hi rend="italic">divergence</hi> of the two inferences pro and con deducible from the topic of consequences: but not only is this common to all rhetorical argumentation, and certainly not characteristic of this particular topic, but it also loses sight of the deviation from a true standard, which we have supposed this metaphorical application of the term to imply. </p>

						<p>Top. XV. This Topic is derived from the habit men have, which may be assumed to be almost universal, of concealing their real opinions and wishes in respect of things good and bad, which are always directed to their own interests, under the outward show and profession of noble and generous sentiments and of a high and pure morality. Thus, to take two examples from de Soph. El. c. 12, they openly profess that a noble death is preferable to a life of pleasure; that poverty and rectitude, is better than ill-got gains, than wealth accompanied with disgrace: but secretly they think and wish the contrary. These contrary views and inclinations can always be played off one against the other in argument, and the opponent made to seem to be asserting a paradox: you infer the one or the other as the occasion requires. This is in fact the most effective (<foreign lang="greek">κυριώτατος</foreign>) of all topics for bringing about this result. The mode of dealing with the topic is thus described in de Soph. El. l. c. 173 <hi rend="italic">a</hi> 2, &ldquo;If the thesis is in accordance with their real desires, the <pb n="275"/> respondent should be confronted with their public professions; if it is in accordance with them [the latter], he should be confronted with their real desires. In either case he must fall into paradox, and contradict either their publicly expressed, or secret opinions.&rdquo; Poste, Transl. p. 43. This is for dialectics: but it may be applied equally well to rhetorical practice, in which there is nearly always a real or (as in the epideictic branch) imaginary opponent. The author proceeds, Ib. 173 <hi rend="italic">a</hi> 7, further to illustrate this by the familiar opposition of <foreign lang="greek">φύσις</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">νόμος</foreign>, nature and convention or custom, which is to be handled in the same way as the preceding, and is <foreign lang="greek">πλεῖστος τόπος τοῦ τὰ παράδοξα λέγειν</foreign>: referring to Callicles' well-known exposition of the true doctrine of justice conventional and natural, in Plato's Gorgias, c. 38, foll. </p>
						<p>This topic does not occur in Cicero's tract, which is confined to dialectics; nor is it found amongst the rhetorical topics of Quintilian's tenth chapter of Book V, which has supplied us with so many illustrations of Aristotle. </p>
						<p>&lsquo;Another; whereas in public and in secret men praise not the same things, but openly most highly extol what is just and right, yet secretly (privately, in their hearts,) prefer their own interest and advantage, from these (i. e. from premisses derived from the one or the other of these two modes of thought and expression, whichever it be that the opponent has given utterance to,) we must endeavour to infer the other: for of all <hi rend="italic">paradoxical</hi> topics (topics that lead to paradox, which enable us to represent the opponent as guilty of it,) this is the most effective (most powerful, mightiest, most authoritative)&rsquo;. If the opponent has been indulging in some high-flown moral commonplaces about virtue and honour, by an appeal to the real but <hi rend="italic">secret</hi> feelings of the audience on such matters, we must shew that such sentiments are paradoxical, or contrary to common opinion; or conversely, if we have occasion to assume the high moral tone, make our appeal to those opinions which they openly profess, and shew that it is a paradox to assume with the opponent that men are incapable of any other motives than such as are suggested by sordid self-interest. </p>

Two ratios of equality. The argument is a <hi rend="italic">reductio ad absurdum.</hi> The first ratio is hypothetical. If tall boys are really to be regarded as men, then by the same ratio, &amp;c. </p>
						<p>&lsquo;And Theodectes, in the &ldquo;law&rdquo;&rsquo; (which he proposes, in his declamation, for the reform of the mercenary service, see above &sect; 11, note) &lsquo;you make citizens of your mercenaries, such as Strabax and Charidemus, for their respectability and virtue, and won't you (by the same proportion) make exiles of those who have been guilty of such desperate (<foreign lang="greek">ἀνήκεστα</foreign>) atrocities?&rsquo; </p>
						<p>Of these &lsquo;mercenaries&rsquo; who swarmed in Greece from the beginning of the fourth century onwards, the causes of their growth, their character and conduct, and the injury they brought upon Greece, see an account in Grote, <hi rend="italic">Hist. Gr.</hi> Vol. XI p. 392 seq. [chap. LXXXVII]. </p>
						<p>Charidemus, of Oreus in Euboea, in the middle of that century, was perhaps the most celebrated of their leaders. He was a brave and successful soldier, but faithless, and profligate and reckless in personal character. Theopomp. ap. Athen. X 436 B. C. Theopomp. Fr. 155, Fragm. Hist. Gr., ed. C. and Th. M&uuml;ller, p. 384 <hi rend="italic">b</hi> (Firmin Didot). <foreign lang="greek">διὰ τὴν ἐπιείκειαν</foreign>, therefore, is not to be taken as an exact description of Charidemus' character, but is the assumption upon which the Athenians acted when they conferred these rewards. His only real merit was the service he had done them. He plays a leading part in Demosthenes' speech, c. Aristocratem; who mentions several times, &sect;&sect; 23, 65, 89, the citizenship conferred on him by the Athenians in acknowledgment of his services, as well as&mdash;somewhat later&mdash;a golden crown, &sect; 145, <foreign lang="greek">πρῶτον πολίτης, εἶτα πάλιν χρυσοῖς στεφάνοις ὡς εὐεργέτης στεφάνωται</foreign>, &sect; 157, <pb n="277"/> presents, and the name of &lsquo;benefactor&rsquo;, 185, and 188. Besides the Athenians, he was employed by Cotys and his son Cersobleptes, kings of Thrace, and by Memnon and Mentor in Asia. A complete account of him and his doings is to be found in Weber's Proleg. ad Dem. c. Aristocr. pp. LX&mdash;LXXXIII. </p>
						<p>Of the other mercenary leader, Strabax, all that we know is derived from Dem. c. Lept. &sect; 84, that through the intervention or by the recommendation (<foreign lang="greek">διὰ</foreign>) of Iphicrates he received a certain &lsquo;honour&rsquo; from the Athenians, to which Theodectes' extract here adds that this was the citizenship. We learn further from Harpocration and Suidas that Strabax is&mdash;an <foreign lang="greek">ὄνομα κύριον</foreign>. &ldquo;De commendatione Iphicratis, ornatus Strabax videri potest Iphicratis in eodem bello (sc. Corinthiaco) adiutor fuisse.&rdquo; F. A. Wolff, ad loc. Dem. </p>

						<p>&lsquo;And in fact, as a general rule, we may always assume&rsquo; (<hi rend="italic">subaudi</hi> <foreign lang="greek">δεῖ, χρή</foreign>, <pb n="278"/> <hi rend="italic">aut tale aliquid</hi>) the result of either of two things to be the same with that of the other (<foreign lang="greek">ἑκατέρου</foreign>), (or with <foreign lang="greek">ἑκάστου</foreign>, as A^{c}, adopted by Spengel, the result of <hi rend="italic">anything</hi>, i. e. any things, two or more, that we have to argue about) &lsquo;as in the example, &ldquo;what you are about to decide upon is not Isocrates, but a study and practice, whether or not philosophy deserves to be studied.&rdquo;&rsquo; Whether you decide upon Isocrates or his pursuit and study, the inference or result <hi rend="italic">is the same</hi> (<foreign lang="greek">ταὐτόν</foreign>), and can be deduced equally from both. I have here adopted Spengel's emendation of Isocrates for Socrates, &ldquo;quam emendationem,&rdquo; as Spengel modestly says, &ldquo;Victorius si integram vidisset Antidosin nobis non reliquisset&rdquo;. It is given in his <hi rend="italic">Specim. Comm. in Ar. Rhet.</hi>, Munich, 1839, p. 37. A comparison of this passage with Isocr. <foreign lang="greek">περὶ ἀντιδόσεως</foreign>, &sect; 173, <foreign lang="greek">οὐ γὰρ περὶ ἐμοῦ μέλλετε μόνον τὴν ψῆφον διοίσειν ἀλλὰ καὶ περὶ ἐπιτηδεύματος, ᾧ πολλοὶ τῶν νεωτέρων προσέχουσι τὸν νοῦν</foreign>, certifies the emendation. Even Bekker has accepted it. At the same time the <hi rend="italic">vulgata lectio</hi> <foreign lang="greek">Σωκράτους</foreign>, as Victorius interprets it, yields a very sufficient sense, thus more briefly expressed by Schrader, &ldquo;Socrate damnato simul damnabitur studium sapientiae: Socrate servato servabuntur sapientiae studia;&rdquo; Socrates and his study or pursuit stand or fall together; to condemn Socrates, is to condemn philosophy: and might even be thought to be confirmed by <foreign lang="greek">κρίνειν</foreign>, which more immediately suggests a <hi rend="italic">judicial</hi> decision. </p>
						<p>&lsquo;And that (the result, effect, consequence of) <hi rend="italic">giving earth and water</hi> is the same as, equivalent to, slavery&rsquo;. The demand of &lsquo;earth and water&rsquo; by the Persian monarchs from a conquered prince or state, in token of submission, and as a symbol of absolute dominion or complete possession of the soil&mdash;therefore equivalent to slavery, <foreign lang="greek">δουλεύειν</foreign>&mdash;is referred to frequently by Herodotus, IV 126, Darius to Idanthyrsus, the Scythian king, <foreign lang="greek">δεσπότῃ τῷ σῷ δῶρα φέρων γῆν τε καὶ ὕδωρ</foreign>. V 17, the same to Amyntas king of Macedonia, Ib. 18, the same to the Athenians, Ib. 73, VII 131, 133, 138, 163. Plut. Themist. c. 6. Plin. N. H. XXII 4 (ap. B&auml;hr), <hi rend="italic">Summum apud antiquos signum victoriae erat herbam porrigere victos, hoc est terra et altrice ipsa humo et humatione etiam cedere: quem morem etiam nunc durare apud Germanos scio.</hi> It appears from Ducange, Gloss. s. v. <hi rend="italic">Investitura</hi>, that this custom was still continued in the transmission of land during the middle ages (B&auml;hr). </p>
						<p>&lsquo;And participation in the general peace (would be equivalent to) doing (Philip's) bidding&rsquo;. The Schol. on this passage writes thus: <foreign lang="greek">Φίλιππος κατηνάγκασε τοὺς Ἀθηναίους ἵν’  εἰρηνεύωσιν μετ̓ αὐτοῦ ὥσπερ καὶ αἱ ἄλλαι χῶραι, ὁ δὲ Δημοσθένης ἀντιπίπτων λέγει ὅτι τὸ μετέχειν τῆς κοινῆς εἰρήνης μετὰ τοῦ Φιλίππου ἡμᾶς, ὡς καὶ τοὺς λοιποὺς πάντας, ἐστι τὸ ποιεῖν ὅ προστάττει ὁ Φίλιππος</foreign>. Spengel was the first to point out (<hi rend="italic">Specim. Comm.</hi> u. s. p. 39) that the <foreign lang="greek">κοινὴ εἰρήνη</foreign> here referred to is the same of which mention occurs several times in a speech <foreign lang="greek">περὶ τῶν πρὸς Ἀλέξανδρον συνθηκῶν</foreign>&mdash;attributed to Demosthenes, but more probably by Hyperides; see the Greek argument, and Grote, <hi rend="italic">H. Gr.</hi> [chap. XCI] XII 21 and note&mdash; <pb n="279"/> &sect;&sect; 10, 11, 17, 19, 30. The <foreign lang="greek">κοινὴ εἰρήνη</foreign>, and the <foreign lang="greek">συνθῆκαι πρὸς Ἀλέξ</foreign>. both denote the convention at Corinth of the deputies of all the Greek states, with the exception of the Lacedaemonians who refused to appear, in 336 B. C., &ldquo;which recognised Hellas as a confederacy under the Macedonian prince (Alexander, not Philip) as imperator, president, or executive head and arm.&rdquo; Grote, u. s. p. 18. The speech <foreign lang="greek">π. τ. π. Ἀλέξ. ς.</foreign>, according to the same authority, p. 21, was delivered in 335. But neither Aristotle's quotation, nor the Scholiast's comment, can refer to this speech, as Spengel himself observes. If the Scholiast is right in describing the opposition of Demosthenes as directed against <hi rend="italic">Philip</hi>, it must be referred to a different speech delivered by him against the <hi rend="italic">former</hi> agreement of a similar kind with Philip, after Chaeronea, which took place two years earlier than that with Alexander, in 338. Grote, u. s., p. 17. Comp. XI 700. [A. Schaefer, <hi rend="italic">Dem. u. s. Zeit</hi>, III 186&mdash;193.] </p>
						<p>This passage has been already referred to in the Introduction, on the question of the date of publication of the Rhetoric, p. 28; and again, 46 note 2, on the references to Demosthenes in the same work. </p>
						<p>&lsquo;Of the two alternatives (the affirmative or negative side, whether the result is or is not the same, either may be taken, whichever happens to be serviceable&rsquo;. Or, as Victorius, &lsquo;of the two alternatives, which though in themselves different, yet in the result are the same, we may always take that which best suits our argument&rsquo;. </p>

						<p>Top. XVIII. &lsquo;Another (is derived from the natural habit or tendency of mankind) that the same men don't always choose the same things&rsquo; (Spengel omits <foreign lang="greek">τοὺς αὐτοὺς</foreign> with A^{c}; Bekker, as usual, retains it) &lsquo;after as before (something intermediate, act, occurrence, period), but conversely&rsquo; (i. e. <hi rend="italic">do</hi> the second time what they have avoided the first, or <hi rend="italic">vice versa</hi>); &lsquo;of which the following enthymeme is an example&rsquo;. </p>
						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ἢ</lemma> <hi rend="italic">quaere</hi> <foreign lang="greek">ᾗ</foreign>? which expresses &lsquo;as&rsquo; (in the way in which), much more naturally than <foreign lang="greek">ἤ</foreign>. This seems to be the required sense: and so I think Victorius understands it, &ldquo;non eadem iidem homines diversis temporibus sequuntur.&rdquo; The same meaning is very awkwardly expressed, if indeed it <hi rend="italic">is</hi> expressed, by rendering <foreign lang="greek">ἤ</foreign> &lsquo;or&rsquo;. In that case <foreign lang="greek">ὕστερον</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">πρότερον</foreign> must be &lsquo;at one time or another&rsquo;: Riccobon &lsquo;posterius vel prius&rsquo; &lsquo;after or before&rsquo;: &lsquo;sooner or later&rsquo;. I will put the question, and leave it to the judgment of others. Which is the more natural expression, the more usual Greek, and more in accordance with the example? &lsquo;The same men don't always choose the same things after as before&rsquo;, i. e. the second time, when they have to repeat some action or the like, as the first time, when the circumstances are perhaps different: or, if <foreign lang="greek">ἤ</foreign> be <hi rend="italic">or</hi>, &lsquo;men don't always choose the same things after <hi rend="italic">or</hi> before, sooner <hi rend="italic">or</hi> later&rsquo;. Surely the alternative is here out of place; in this case it should be <foreign lang="greek">καί</foreign>, not <foreign lang="greek">ἤ</foreign>. </p>
						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ἐνθύμημα</lemma>] Victorius interprets this &ldquo;argumentum <hi rend="italic">ex contrariis</hi> conclusum:&rdquo; on which see Introd. pp. 104, 5, Cic. Top. XIII 55. This is the <pb n="280"/> sense in which it is found in the Rhet. ad Alex., Cicero and Quintilian, and was in fact the <hi rend="italic">common</hi> usage of it. But, as far as I can recollect, it <hi rend="italic">never</hi> occurs in this special sense, at all events, in Aristotle's Rhetoric; and is in fact one of the leading distinctions between it and the Rhet. ad Alex. Neither was there any occasion to depart here from <hi rend="italic">his</hi> ordinary use of the term: for enthymemes, i. e. rhetorical inferences in general, are exactly what he is employed in illustrating throughout this chapter. </p>
						<p>The original sentence of Lysias begins with, <foreign lang="greek">δεινὸν γὰρ ἂν εἴη, ὦ Ἀθηναῖοι, εἰ κ.τ.λ.</foreign> &lsquo;For monstrous would it be, men of Athens, if when we were in exile we fought for our return (to be restored to our) home, and now that we <hi rend="italic">have</hi> returned (been restored) we shall fly to avoid fighting&rsquo;. We were eager to fight before (this was, as will appear afterwards, with the Lacedaemonians who aided the Thirty), shall we now after our restoration shrink from it? The <hi rend="italic">example</hi> is an instance of what men are in the habit of doing, viz. changing their minds without reason: the argument, that it is unreasonable, and monstrous at all events to do it now. </p>
						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">κατελθεῖν</lemma>, to return from exile, prop. &lsquo;down&rsquo;, <foreign lang="greek">κατά</foreign>, viz. to the shore or harbour, at which almost all returned exiles would naturally arrive; either from the interior of the country, <foreign lang="greek">ἀναβαίνειν καταβαίνειν</foreign>; or from the open sea into port, <foreign lang="greek">ἀνάγεσθαι</foreign> contrasted with <foreign lang="greek">κατάγεσθαι, προσσχεῖν</foreign>. Aesch. Choeph. 3, and his own commentary, Arist. Ran. 1163&mdash;5. </p>
						<p>This is followed by Aristotle's explanation, which is certainly more obscure than what it professes to explain. &lsquo;That is to say (<foreign lang="greek">γάρ</foreign>), at one time (before) they preferred staying (where they were, &lsquo;maintaining their ground&rsquo;) at the price of fighting; at another (<hi rend="italic">after</hi> their restoration) not fighting at the expense of not staying&rsquo;, i. e. the <hi rend="italic">second</hi> time, they preferred <hi rend="italic">not staying</hi>, quitting the city, to avoid fighting. It is necessary to interpret <foreign lang="greek">ἀντί</foreign> in this way, not &lsquo;instead of&rsquo;&mdash;if the reading be sound, to bring the explanation into conformity with the example; and thus no alteration is required. </p>
						<p>The words quoted by Ar. are taken from a speech of Lysias, of which Dionysius, de Lys. Iud. c. 33, has preserved a long fragment; printed amongst Lysias' speeches as Orat. 34. Baiter et Sauppe <hi rend="italic">Or. Att.</hi> I 147. [Blass, <hi rend="italic">die Attische Beredsamkeit</hi> I p.441 and Jebb's <hi rend="italic">Attic Orators</hi> I p. 211.] Dion. gives an account of the occasion of it in the preceding chapter. He doubts if it was ever actually delivered. The title of it is, <foreign lang="greek">περὶ τοῦ μὴ καταλῦσαι τὴν πάτριον πολιτείαν Ἀθήνῃσι</foreign>; and its object was to prevent the carrying into effect of a proposal of one Phormisius, one of the restored exiles <foreign lang="greek">μετὰ τοῦ δήμου</foreign>,&mdash;this was after the expulsion of the Thirty in 403 B. C., when the demus had been restored and recovered its authority, and the other party were now in exile&mdash;to permit the return of the present exiles, but to accompany this by a constitutional change, which should exclude from political rights all but the possessors of land; a measure which would have disfranchised 5000 citizens. The passage here quoted refers to a somewhat different subject. The Lace<pb n="281"/> daemonians, who were at hand with their troops, were trying to impose the measure upon them by force, dictating, and ordering, <foreign lang="greek">κελεύουσιν, προστάττουσιν</foreign>, &sect; 6, and apparently preparing to interfere with arms. Lysias is accordingly exhorting the Athenians to resist manfully, and not to give way and quit the city again, after their restoration, for fear of having to fight: and Aristotle&mdash;and this is a most striking instance of the difficulty that so frequently arises from Aristotle's haste and carelessness in writing, and also of his constant liability to lapses of memory&mdash;quoting from memory, and quoting wrong, and neglecting to mention the occasion of the speech and the name of the author, which he had probably forgotten for the time,&mdash;has both altered the words and omitted precisely the two things&mdash;<foreign lang="greek">δεινὸν ἂν εἴη</foreign>, which shows what the <hi rend="italic">inference</hi> is intended to be, and <foreign lang="greek">Λακεδαιμονίοις</foreign>&mdash;which would have enabled his readers to understand his meaning. The passage of Lysias runs thus: <foreign lang="greek">δεινὸν γὰρ ἂν εἴη, ὦ Ἀθηναῖοι, εἰ ὅτε μὲν ἐφεύγομεν, ἐμαχόμεθα Λακεδαιμονίοις ἵνα κατέλθωμεν, κατελθόντες δὲ φευξόμεθα ἵνα μὴ μαχώμεθα</foreign>. And it is now pretty clear what the intention of the writer of the fragment was, namely to stimulate the Athenian assembly not to submit to the dictation of the Lacedaemonians and to encounter them if it were necessary in battle, by urging the inconsistency and absurdity of which they would be guilty, if, whilst they were ready to fight before their restoration to their city, now that they were in actual possession of it they should quit it and return into exile, merely to avoid fighting. </p>

					<div3 id="b2c23s20" type="section" n="20">
						<p>Top. XIX. The wording of this is also very obscure from the extreme brevity. The title of the topic in one of Victorius' MSS is <foreign lang="greek">ἐκ τοῦ παρὰ τὸν σκόπον τοῦ λαβόντος, συμβαίνειν</foreign>, &lsquo;inference, from the issue being contrary to the aim or intention of the receiver,&rsquo;&mdash;i. e. a mistake on the part of the receiver of a gift, who takes it as offered with an intention different from the real motive. This however is only a single instance of the application of the topic, and derived solely from the <hi rend="italic">illustration</hi>, <foreign lang="greek">οἷον εἰ δοίη κ.τ.λ.</foreign> The true interpretation is, as Brandis expresses it, u. s., p. 20, the general one, &ldquo;An inference from the possible, to the real, motive,&rdquo; as appears from the examples. </p>
						<p>Two readings have to be considered: v. l. followed and explained by Victorius <foreign lang="greek">εἰ μὴ γένοιτο</foreign>, which Bekker (ed. 3) has retained; and, Vater's conjecture, <foreign lang="greek">ἢ γένοιτο</foreign>, following the Schol., <foreign lang="greek">οὕτινος ἕνεκα εἶναι, ἤτοι, διὸ δίδωμί σοι νομίσματα</foreign> (this again refers exclusively to the first example). <foreign lang="greek">ἢ γένοιτο, ἤτοι ἔδωκα</foreign>: which at all events seems to shew that <hi rend="italic">he</hi> read <foreign lang="greek">ἢ γένοιτο</foreign>: this is also expressed in Muretus' version, &lsquo;cuius rei causa aliquid est, aut fieri potest,&rsquo; and adopted by Spengel in his recent edition. To this in what follows <foreign lang="greek">εἶναι ἢ γεγενῆσθαι</foreign> properly corresponds. The translation will then be, &lsquo;To say, that the <hi rend="italic">possible</hi> reason for a fact (<foreign lang="greek">εἶναι</foreign>) or motive for an action (<foreign lang="greek">γίγνεσθαι</foreign>), (<hi rend="italic">lit.</hi> that for which anything <hi rend="italic">might</hi> be, or be done), <hi rend="italic">that is</hi> the (true) reason or motive of the fact or action; as in the case of one giving another something, in order to cause him pain by afterwards taking it away (withdrawing it)&rsquo;. Here is an ostensible motive&mdash;a <hi rend="italic">gift</hi> being usually intended to cause pleasure&mdash;which <pb n="282"/> conceals the real motive, which is to cause pain; and this is the inference, you infer from the apparent fact or possible motive to the real one; the object of the topic being to assign a motive which suits your argument. Such then is the general meaning of the topic: the examples are all of the possible concealed <hi rend="italic">motive</hi> or <hi rend="italic">intention</hi>&mdash;which may be bad or good as your argument requires&mdash;that being the form in which it is more likely to be of use in Rhetoric. <foreign lang="greek">οὗ ἕνεκ’  ἂν εἴη ἢ γένοιτο</foreign> &lsquo;that for which so and so would, could, or might be, or be done&rsquo;, (<hi rend="italic">would</hi> be naturally or generally, <hi rend="italic">might</hi> be possibly,) expresses the conditionality or possibility of the fact, motive, or intention, a meaning which is confirmed by <foreign lang="greek">ἐνδέχεται γάρ κ.τ.λ.</foreign>, in the explanation of the third example. (I call it the <hi rend="italic">third</hi>, <foreign lang="greek">οἷον εἰ δοίη ἄνλυπήσῃ</foreign> being an illustration.) </p>
						<p>On Victorius' interpretation of <foreign lang="greek">εἰ μὴ γένοιτο</foreign>, &lsquo;cuius rei caussa aliquid esse potest, <hi rend="italic">quamvis factum non sit</hi>,&rsquo; Vater says, &ldquo;sed hoc <hi rend="italic">quamvis factum non sit</hi>, ad rem non satis facit, neque in exemplis quae sequuntur eo respicitur an haec caussa vera sit necne:&rdquo; but whether that be so or not, I think that a still better reason may be given for rejecting it, that <foreign lang="greek">εἰ μὴ γένοιτο</foreign> <hi rend="italic">cannot</hi> be rendered <hi rend="italic">quamvis</hi> &amp;c., which would require <foreign lang="greek">εἰ καί</foreign>, or <foreign lang="greek">καὶ εἰ</foreign> (<foreign lang="greek">κεἰ</foreign>) <foreign lang="greek">μὴ γένοιτο</foreign>. Victorius seems to mean, though the Greek (even independently of <foreign lang="greek">εἰ</foreign> for <hi rend="italic">quamvis</hi>) would hardly I think bear such an interpretation, &lsquo;to assert that what <hi rend="italic">may</hi> be the cause of a thing (i. e. an act) really is so, although it has not been (or, were not) done at all&rsquo;; in other words, &lsquo;though it is <hi rend="italic">not</hi>&rsquo;: and this, though I cannot think it the right rendering, can scarcely be said to be altogether &lsquo;beside the point.&rsquo; </p>
						<p>On <foreign lang="greek">εἰ δοίη ἄν</foreign>, see Appendix on <foreign lang="greek">εἰ δύναιτ’  ἄν</foreign>, c.20.5, &lsquo;<hi rend="italic">On</hi> <foreign lang="greek">ἄν</foreign> <hi rend="italic">with Optative after certain particles</hi>&rsquo; [printed at the end of the notes to this Book]. </p>
						<p>In conformity with the explanation there given, <foreign lang="greek">δοίη ἄν</foreign>, the conditional, is joined with <foreign lang="greek">εἰ</foreign>, just as the future might be, of which in fact the conditional (as the <hi rend="italic">tense</hi> is in French and Italian) is a mere modification. </p>
						<p>The first example, from an unknown Tragic poet (Wagner, <hi rend="italic">Fragm. Tragic. Gr.</hi> III 186), warns us that &lsquo;Heaven bestows on many great successes or prosperity, which it offers not out of good will, with no kind or benevolent intent, but that the disasters that they (afterwards) meet with may be more marked and conspicuous&rsquo;&mdash;a contrast of the apparent with the real intention, from which an inference may be drawn and applied to a parallel case. Victorius compares Caes. de B. G. I 14 (ad Helvet. legatum) <hi rend="italic">Consuesse deos immortales, quo gravius homines ex commutatione rerum doleant, quos pro scelere eorum ulcisci velint, his secundiores interdum res et diuturniorem impunitatem concedere.</hi> [Cf. Claudian's <hi rend="italic">tolluntur in altum, ut lapsu graviore ruant</hi> (in Rufinum I. 22, 23).] <pb n="283"/> </p>
						<p>&lsquo;And another from Antiphon's Meleager&rsquo;. Referred to above, II 2. 19, where some account is given of the author, and the story of his play. The author of the Meleager is Antiphon the <hi rend="italic">Tragic</hi> poet. See also note on II 23. 5, where the lines quoted are probably from some play. Wagner, <hi rend="italic">Fr. Tr. Gr.</hi> III 113. Antiph. Fr. 3. Conf. Meineke, <hi rend="italic">Fragm. Com. Gr.</hi> I 315. He suggests <foreign lang="greek">κάνωσι</foreign> for <foreign lang="greek">κτάνωσι</foreign> (<foreign lang="greek">καίνειν</foreign> is found several times in Soph., twice in Aesch., and once in Xen.

Fortissimi quique Graecorum heroes (ita fere apud poetam fuisse videtur) convenerunt, non quo ipsi aprum Calydonium interficiant, sed ut Meleagri virtutem Graecis testificentur.&rdquo; </p>
						<p>A third from Theodectes' Ajax (Aj. Frag. 1, Wagner, u. s., p. 118); cited again &sect; 24, and III 15. 10, where the same passage of the play is referred to. It is there employed in illustration of the interpretation of a fact or a motive, favourable or unfavourable according to the requirements of the argument; exactly as in the topic now under consideration. Ar. there explains in much plainer terms its use and application: <foreign lang="greek">κοινὸν δὲ τῷ διαβάλλοντι καὶ τῷ ἀπολυομένῳ, ἐπειδὴ τὸ αὐτὸ ἐνδέχεται πλειόνων ἕνεκα πραχθῆναι, τῷ μὲν διαβάλλοντι κακοηθιστέον ἐπὶ τὸ χεῖρον ἐκλαμβάνοντι</foreign> (putting an unfavourable construction upon the act and its motive), <foreign lang="greek">τῷ δὲ ἀπολυομένῳ ἐπὶ τὸ βελτιον</foreign> (the reverse). The same explanation will apply to both quotations alike. Theodectes' play contained no doubt a rhetorical contest&mdash;which would be quite in his manner, like Ovid's&mdash; between Ajax and Ulysses for the arms of Achilles, in which the argument from the construction of motives would be applied to the fact, by the competitors, in the two opposite senses. Ulysses would refer to the &lsquo;preference&rsquo; (<foreign lang="greek">προείλετο</foreign> occurs in both the passages), shewing a sense of his superior merit, implied by Diomede when he chose him out of all the Greeks to be his companion in the hazardous exploring expedition to Troy by night (Hom. Il. K. 227 seq. Ovid. Met. XIII 238 seq. <hi rend="italic">Est aliquid de tot Graiorum millibus unum A Diomede legi</hi>, line 241); Ajax would retort that this was not the real motive of Diomede's choice, but it was that &lsquo;the attendant might be inferior to himself&rsquo; (II 23. 20) or (as it is expressed in III 15. 10,) &lsquo;because he alone was too mean to be his rival&rsquo;, to compete with him in his achievements, and to share in the renown to be thereby acquired. </p>

						<p>Top. XX. &lsquo;Another, common to counsellors (in deliberative rhet.) as well as the two parties in forensic pleadings&rsquo;. This seems to imply that the preceding topic is confined to the forensic branch; and to this, of the three, it is no doubt, most applicable; the suggestion and construction of motives and intentions being there most of all in request. Still in an encounter of two opponents in the public assembly, as in that of Dem. and Aesch., it is almost equally available; and in the remaining branch even more so, as a topic of panegyric or censure. The present topic, like the five preceding, with the partial exception of Top. XV, which appears also amongst the &lsquo;fallacies&rsquo; of the de Soph. El., is applicable to Rhetoric alone and does not appear in the dialectical treatise. </p>
						<p>It embraces arguments, which may be used in the deliberative kind in exhorting to some act or course of policy, or dissuading from it; and in judicial practice in the way of accusation or defence; in which &lsquo;we have to inquire, first what are the motives and incentives to action, and what things on the contrary deter men from acting. The things which, if they be on our side or are favourable to us, <foreign lang="greek">ἐὰν ὑπάρχῃ</foreign>, supply motives for action, are such as possibility, facility, advantage, either to self or friends, (of accomplishing or effecting anything); or anything injurious (hurtful, damaging: that is, the power of injuring) and&rsquo; (bringing loss <hi rend="italic">upon</hi>, on this form of adj. see note on I 4.9) &lsquo;involving loss to enemies, or (if or when) the (legal) penalty (for doing something) is less than the thing (that is, the thing done, the success of the deed and the profit of it&rsquo;, (&lsquo;fructus voluptasque quae inde percipitur&rsquo;: &lsquo;quod cupiebant quod sequebantur et optabant.&rsquo; Victorius). The construction of the last words, <foreign lang="greek">ἢ ἐλαττων ἡ ζημία τοῦ πράγματος</foreign> seems to be, if <hi rend="italic">construction</hi> it can be called, that <foreign lang="greek">ἡ ζημία</foreign> is continued as an apposition to the preceding nominatives; &lsquo;the penalty being less than the profit&rsquo; is another incentive to action. &lsquo;From such cases as these, arguments of exhortation or encouragement are drawn, dissuasive from their contraries (impossibility, difficulty, disadvantage, injury, &amp;c.). From these same are derived arguments for accusation and defence: from dissuasives or deterrents, of defence; from persuasives, of accusation&rsquo;. That is to say, in defending a client from a charge of wrong-doing, you collect all the difficulties, dangers, disadvantages and so on, to which the accused would be exposed in doing what he is charged with, and <hi rend="italic">infer</hi> from them the improbability of his guilt: in accusing, you urge all or any of the opposite incitements to commit a crime, above enumerated. To these last, the inducements to the com<pb n="285"/> mission of crime, may be added the topic <hi rend="italic">cui bono</hi>, &lsquo;Cassianum illud&rsquo; [Cic. Phil. II &sect; 35]. Compare with this the passage upon the various motives and inducements to crime and wrong-doing, in I 10. 5 seq., which is there mixed up with a general classification of all sources and causes of action. </p>
						<p>&lsquo;And of this topic the entire &ldquo;art&rdquo; of Pamphilus and Callippus is made up&rsquo;. Of Callippus it has been already stated, <hi rend="italic">supra</hi> &sect; 14, that nothing is known but these two notices of Aristotle. It is likely, as I have there pointed out [pp. 271&mdash;2], that he was one of the earliest pupils of Isocrates mentioned in his <foreign lang="greek">ἀντίδοσις</foreign>, &sect; 93. </p>
						<p>Pamphilus, the rhetorician, is mentioned by Cicero, de Orat. III 21. 82, together with Corax, in somewhat contemptuous terms, <hi rend="italic">Pamphilum nescio quem</hi>, and of his Rhetoric, it is said, (tantam rem) <hi rend="italic">tamquam pueriles delicias aliquas depingere.</hi> It is plain therefore that Pamphilus, like Callippus, belonged to the early school of Rhetoricians of the age of Gorgias and the Sophists, and treated his art like them in a &lsquo;puerile&rsquo; and unworthy manner. Another, and very brief notice of him occurs in Quintilian, III 6. 34, a chapter on the <hi rend="italic">status</hi> or <foreign lang="greek">στάσεις</foreign>; he rejected <hi rend="italic">finitio</hi>, the <foreign lang="greek">ὁρικὴ στάσις</foreign>. Spalding in his note describes the contents of Pamphilus' &lsquo;art&rsquo; from the passage of the Rhet., and then discusses, without coming to a conclusion, the question whether or no this Pamphilus can be identified with a painter of the same name, mentioned in Quint. XII 10. 6, Pliny in several places, and Aristoph. Plut. 385, and the Schol. Spalding has no doubt that Quint.'s Pamphilus, III 6. 34, is the rhetorician. Spengel, <hi rend="italic">Art. Script.</hi> p. 149, note 83, thinks that he cannot be the same as Aristotle's, (erat itaque ille P. non ante Hermagorae tempora,) in consequence of his acquaintance with <foreign lang="greek">στάσεις</foreign>, which were of much later invention, and the name of them unknown even to Ar. The same doubt occurred to myself: but I laid the evil spirit by the consideration that though Aristotle was unacquainted with the technical terms and classification of the <foreign lang="greek">στάσεις</foreign>, he yet was familiar with the <hi rend="italic">thing</hi>, which he frequently refers to; and the <hi rend="italic">technical expression</hi> may belong to Quintilian and not to Pamphilus. Nine times the name of Pamphilus occurs in the Orators, (Sauppe, Ind. Nom. p. 109, ad <hi rend="italic">Orat. Att.</hi> vol. III,) but the rhetorician is not among them. </p>

						<p>Top. XXI. The object of this topic is (says Brandis, u. s., p. 20) to weaken the force of arguments from probability. &ldquo;In incredibilibus provocatur ad effectum, qui si conspicuus sit, resisti non potest quin, quod incredibile videbatur, iam probabile quoque esse fateamur.&rdquo; Schrader. </p>
						<p>&lsquo;Another (class of arguments) is derived from things which are believed to come to pass (<foreign lang="greek">γίγνεσθαι</foreign>, actually to take place or happen) <pb n="286"/> but (still) are beyond (ordinary) belief, (you argue, namely) that they would not have been believed at all, had they not actually been or nearly so&rsquo;: i. e. either <hi rend="italic">been</hi> in existence, or come so near to it, made so near an approach to it, as to enable us by a slight stretch of imagination to realize it so as to be convinced of its existence. Any case of very close analogy, for instance, to the thing in question might produce this conviction. <foreign lang="greek">ἢ ἐγγύς</foreign> is a saving clause; &lsquo;fact or nearly so&rsquo;. Rhetorical argument does not aim at absolute truth and certainty: it is content with a near approach to it within the sphere of the probable, which is enough for complete persuasion. </p>
						<p>&lsquo;Nay even more&rsquo;, (we may further argue that these at first sight incredible things are even <hi rend="italic">more</hi> likely to be true than those that <hi rend="italic">are</hi> at first sight probable. Supply <foreign lang="greek">δοκοῦντά ἐστι</foreign> for the constr. and (<foreign lang="greek">μᾶλλον</foreign>) <foreign lang="greek">ἀληθῆ</foreign> or <foreign lang="greek">ὄντα ἐστί τῶν εἰκότων καὶ πιθανῶν</foreign> for the sense): &lsquo;because men believe in (suppose, assume the existence of,) things either actual, real or probable: if then it (the thing in question) be incredible and not probable, it must be true; because its probability and plausibility are <hi rend="italic">not</hi> the ground of our belief in it&rsquo;. The argument of the last clause is an exemplification of Topic IX, &sect; 10, <hi rend="italic">supra</hi>, see note there. It is an inference <foreign lang="greek">ἐκ διαιρέσεως</foreign>, &lsquo;from division&rsquo;; a <hi rend="italic">disjunctive judgment.</hi> All belief is directed to the true <hi rend="italic">or</hi> the probable: there is no other alternative. All that is believed&mdash;and <hi rend="italic">this</hi> is believed&mdash;must therefore be either true or probable: <hi rend="italic">this</hi> is not probable; therefore it must be true. <foreign lang="greek">ἀληθές</foreign> <hi rend="italic">more antiquae philosophiae</hi> identifies truth and being: <foreign lang="greek">ἀληθές</foreign> here = <foreign lang="greek">ὄν</foreign>. </p>
						<p>In other words, the antecedent improbability of anything may furnish a still stronger argument for its reality than its probability. Anything absolutely incredible is denied at once, unless there be some unusually strong evidence of its being a <hi rend="italic">fact</hi>, however paradoxical. That the belief of it is actually entertained is the strongest proof that it is a fact: for since no one would have supposed it to be true without the strongest evidence, the evidence of it, of whatever kind, must be unusually strong. The instance given is an exemplification of the topic in its first and simplest form. </p>
						<p>&lsquo;As Androcles of Pitthus&rsquo; (or Pithus, whence <foreign lang="greek">ὁ Πιθεύς</foreign>; an Attic deme, of the tribe Cecropis) &lsquo;replied in the charge he brought against the law, to the clamour with which he was assailed by them&rsquo; (the assembly, before which he was arraigning the existing state of the law) &lsquo;for saying &ldquo;the laws require a law to correct them and set them right&rdquo; which they thought highly improbable&mdash;&ldquo;why so do fish require salt (to keep them from corruption), though it is neither probable nor plausible that bred as they are in brine (the salt sea) they should require salt: and so does <pb n="287"/> oil-cake&rsquo; (<foreign lang="greek">στέμφυλα</foreign>, the cake or mass of olives remaining after the oil has been pressed out) &lsquo;require oil (for the same reason), though it is highly improbable that the very thing that produces oil should require oil itself&rsquo;. Here we have an improbable statement which is shewn by two close analogies to be after all very near (<foreign lang="greek">ἐγγύς</foreign>) the truth. </p>
						<p>Of Androcles, and the time and circumstances of his proposed alteration of the laws, nothing is known but what appears in our text. The names of three Androcleses occur in the Orators, (Sauppe, Ind. Nom. p. 13, <hi rend="italic">Or. Att.</hi> III) of which the first, mentioned by Andocides <foreign lang="greek">περὶ μυστηρίων</foreign> &sect; 27, may possibly be the speaker here referred to. The Androcles of Thuc. VIII 65, (comp. Grote, <hi rend="italic">H. G.</hi> VIII 43 [c. LXII], Plut. Alcib. c. 19,) the accuser and opponent of Alcibiades, assassinated in 411 B. C. by the agents of Pisander and the oligarchical party, is most likely identical with Andocides; the time of the events referred to in both authors being nearly the same. I think upon the whole that it is not improbable that Thucydides, Andocides and Aristotle may mean the same person<note anchored="yes">The writer of the Article <hi rend="italic">Androcles</hi>, in Smith's <hi rend="italic">Biogr. Dict.</hi>, has no doubt upon this point. He says on this passage, &ldquo;Ar. has preserved a sentence from one of Androcles' speeches, <hi rend="italic">in which he used an incorrect figure!</hi>&rdquo;.</note>. </p>
						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">στέμφυλα</lemma>] Ar. Nub. 45, Equit. 806, was a common article of food in Attica. It denoted not only the cake of pressed olives, but also of grapes from which the juice had been squeezed. Phrynichus, s. v., has <foreign lang="greek">οἱ μὲν πολλοὶ τὰ τῶν βοτρύων ἐκπιέσματα ἀμαθῶς· οἱ δ’  Ἀττικοί στέμφυλα ἐλαῶν</foreign>. Suidas, on the other hand, <foreign lang="greek">τὸ ἔκδυμα τῆς σταφυλῆς ἢ τῶν ἐλαῶν, οἷς ἀντὶ ὄψων ἐχρῶντο</foreign>, and to the same effect, Hesychius. Also Galen, ap. Lobeck, note. Lobeck settles the matter by quoting Geoponic. VI 12. 435, <foreign lang="greek">εἰδέναι χρὴ ὅτι στέμφυλα οὐχ, ὥς τινες νομίζουσι, τῶν ἐλαιῶν μόνον ἐστὶ πυρῆνες, ἀλλὰ καὶ τὰ τῶν σταφυλῶν γίγαρτα</foreign>. (<foreign lang="greek">πυρῆνες</foreign> must surely be a mistake; no amount of pressing could ever convert grape-stones or olive-kernels into an <foreign lang="greek">ὄψον</foreign>, a dainty or relish, and moreover what is here said, that the oil proceeds from the <foreign lang="greek">στέμφυλα</foreign>, shews that the cake is made of the olives themselves, and not of the mere stones.) The word occurs frequently, as might be expected, in the fragments of the Comic writers: see the Index to Meineke's Collection. </p>

						<p>Top. XXIII. The title of this topic &lsquo;in scripto quodam libro&rsquo; apud Victorium, is <foreign lang="greek">ἀπὸ τοῦ λεγομένης τῆς αἰτίας λύεσθαι διαβολήν</foreign>. </p>
						<p>&lsquo;Another, for&rsquo; (the benefit of; the <hi rend="italic">dative</hi> seems to follow <foreign lang="greek">λέγειν</foreign>;) &lsquo;those that have been previously brought into suspicion or odium, (whether by actual calumny) or suspected&rsquo; (thought to be, having the appearance of being, <foreign lang="greek">δοκοῦσι</foreign>, guilty of something wrong, for some <hi rend="italic">other</hi> reason &mdash;so Vater, reading <foreign lang="greek">ἢ δοκοῦσι</foreign>), &lsquo;both men and things, is to state the reason for the (otherwise) unaccountable circumstance: for there must be <hi rend="italic">some</hi> reason (<foreign lang="greek">δἰ ὅ</foreign> is the <foreign lang="greek">αἰτία</foreign>,) for this appearance (of guilt)&rsquo;. MS A^{c} has <foreign lang="greek">μὴ δοκοῦσι</foreign>, which Victorius adopts and defends. All the recent edd. have <foreign lang="greek">ἤ</foreign>. Victorius understands by <foreign lang="greek">μὴ δοκοῦσι</foreign> a qualification of <foreign lang="greek">προδιαβεβλημένοις</foreign>, to express the unexpected, apparently unreasonable, nature <pb n="289"/> of the calumny or suspicion, which seems to be quite unsuitable to the character and circumstances of the object of it: &ldquo;quae tamen nullo modo haerere ipsis videatur, quod alienae ab ea sint.&rdquo; This agrees extremely well with the <foreign lang="greek">παραδόξου</foreign> following, and this reading and explanation is deserving at all events of consideration. It supposes <hi rend="italic">only one</hi> case to be contemplated, that of <hi rend="italic">unjust</hi> suspicion and consequent calumny. Vater on the contrary thinks that there are <hi rend="italic">two</hi> cases intended, direct calumny, and suspicion <hi rend="italic">for any other reason;</hi> and that this requires <foreign lang="greek">ἢ δοκοῦσι</foreign>. His transl. is, &ldquo;Homines significantur, qui propter calumniam vel alia de caussa videantur aliquo modo affecti esse.&rdquo; This is not very clear; but I suppose his meaning to be what I have said. In this case we must understand <foreign lang="greek">ἀδικῆσαι</foreign>, or something equivalent, after <foreign lang="greek">δοκοῦσι</foreign>. Spengel, in his recent edition, says that Victorius' reading and interpretation is refuted by the sense of the passage&mdash;which I cannot agree with&mdash;and that <foreign lang="greek">διαβεβλῆσθαι</foreign> must be understood after <foreign lang="greek">ἢ δοκοῦσιν</foreign>. But what is the meaning of &lsquo;apparent&rsquo; calumny? and how is it distinguished from the other? </p>
						<p>There is another point which has hitherto escaped observation, viz. the interpretation of <foreign lang="greek">καὶ ἀνθρώποις καὶ πράγμασι</foreign>. Victorius interprets it as in apposition to <foreign lang="greek">τοῖς διαβεβλημένοις</foreign>, &lsquo;qui valet ad purgandas aliquas et personas et res,&rsquo; which at first sight seems the most natural and obvious explanation, and I have adopted it in my translation. But then, what are the <hi rend="italic">things</hi> that can be calumniated or brought under suspicion? One might suppose that it means human actions: but Victorius renders it <hi rend="italic">res;</hi> and in fact actions are necessarily included in <foreign lang="greek">τοῖς διαβεβλημένοις</foreign>; they are <hi rend="italic">the</hi> things that are subject to misinterpretation; and therefore there is no ground for a distinction between <hi rend="italic">men</hi> and their <hi rend="italic">actions</hi>, so far at least as they are subject to calumny. I will venture to suggest, though not with complete confidence, that we might give the words a different construction, and understand them thus, &ldquo;for the benefit of those who have been unjustly&mdash;we must in this case read <foreign lang="greek">μὴ δοκοῦσιν</foreign>, unlikely to be guilty&mdash;subjected to suspicion, <hi rend="italic">by</hi> men (by human agency, directly) or by circumstances&rdquo; (indirectly; which would be equivalent to Vater's second case). At all events it makes very good sense. </p>
						<p>We now come to a still greater difficulty, the interpretation of <foreign lang="greek">ὑποβεβλημένης</foreign> in the example. A^{c} reads <foreign lang="greek">διαβεβλημένης τινὸς πρὸς τὸν υἱόν</foreign> &lsquo;when a certain woman had been brought into suspicion with respect to (i. e. as to her conduct or dealings with) her son&rsquo;, which gives a very sufficient sense, but is rejected by Victorius as well as Bekker and Spengel and modern editors in general. </p>
						<p>Victorius' rendering&mdash;and no other Commentary that I have seen has a word on the subject&mdash;is as follows; I must give it in his own words as it will hardly bear translation. &ldquo;Ceu cum mater quaedam filium subiisset, corporique ipsius corpus suum supposuisset, ut commode eum osculari posset, in eo habitu corporis spectata visa est stuprum cum adolescente exercere.&rdquo; <foreign lang="greek">ὑποβεβλημένης</foreign> is translated literally. <pb n="290"/> </p>
						<p>I see no other meaning that can be attached to the words as the text at present stands, but it must be observed that <foreign lang="greek">ὑποβεβλημένης τὸν αὑτῆς ϝἱόν</foreign> is very strange Greek for <hi rend="italic">supposuisse filium corpori suo</hi>, and I do not see how it can be justified. The accus after <foreign lang="greek">ὑποβάλλειν</foreign> represents not the thing <hi rend="italic">under which</hi> you throw something, but the thing that you <hi rend="italic">throw under</hi> something else: and the <hi rend="italic">passive</hi> <foreign lang="greek">ὑποβεβλημένης</foreign> meaning &lsquo;throwing herself under&rsquo;, is possible perhaps, but by no means usual, Greek. The ordinary construction of <foreign lang="greek">ὑποβάλλειν</foreign> with two objects, appears in these examples. The object <hi rend="italic">thrown</hi> is in the accus.; the object under which it is thrown is either in the dat. or has a prepos. introduced before it. <foreign lang="greek">ὑποβάλλειν πλευροῖς πλευρά</foreign>, Eur. Or. 223, <foreign lang="greek">ὑποβ. ἀμφὶ μαστὸν σποδόν</foreign>, Suppl. 1160. Xen. Oecon. 18. 5, <foreign lang="greek">ὑπ. τὰ ἄτριπτα ὑπὸ τοὺς πὀδας</foreign>. Plut. Brut. 31, <foreign lang="greek">ὑπ. τοῖς ξίφεσιν τὰς σφαγάς</foreign>, and similarly in the metaph. applications of it (from Rost and Palm's Lex.) On the genit. <foreign lang="greek">ὑποβεβλημένης</foreign> see note on II 8. 10. </p>
						<p>The general meaning of the whole is, that a mother had been seen in this position which she had assumed for the purpose of embracing her <hi rend="italic">own son</hi>&mdash;which was not known to the witness&mdash;was accordingly subjected to the suspicion of illicit intercourse with him: and we are to suppose further, that her character hitherto had been unimpeachable: when the true reason was explained or stated, the calumny was at once quashed (dissolved or unloosed as a knot). On this sense of <foreign lang="greek">λύειν, διαλύειν</foreign>, &amp;c. see note in Introd. on II 25, p. 267, note 1. </p>
						<p>A second example is taken from the argument between Ajax and Ulysses in the contest for the arms of Achilles, in Theodectes' tragedy &lsquo;the Ajax&rsquo;, already referred to &sect; 20 supra. where Ulysses tells Ajax &lsquo;why (the <hi rend="italic">reason</hi>, which explains the paradox), though he is really braver than Ajax, he is not thought to be so.&rsquo; What the reason was we are not told; nor does Ovid. Met. XIII supply the deficiency. </p>

						<p>&lsquo;Leodamas, for instance, said in his defence, when charged by Thrasybulus with having had his name inscribed on the column (as a mark of infamy) in the Acropolis, only he had struck (or cut) it out in the time of &lsquo;the Thirty&rsquo;, replied that it was impossible; for the Thirty could have trusted him more if the record of his hatred of the <hi rend="italic">people</hi> had remained engraved on the column&rsquo;.

						<p>On Leodamas, see on I 7. 13, and the reff. Sauppe, ad Orat. Fragm. XVI, <hi rend="italic">Or.

He argues that the Leodamas whose name was inscribed on the column as a &lsquo;traitor&rsquo; (<hi rend="italic">in proditorum indice inscr.</hi>), according to Thrasybulus, before the domination of the Thirty, that is, not later than 404 B. C. (he says 405), when he must have been about thirty years old<note anchored="yes">Je n'en vois pas la n&eacute;cessit&eacute;.</note>, could not have been the Leodamas mentioned by Demosth. c. Lept. &sect; 146, as one of the Syndics under the Leptinean law, in 355 B.C., and consequently, that the latter, the famous orator of Acharnae, must have been a different person, because he would then have been nearly 90. Clinton, <hi rend="italic">F. H.</hi> II 111, sub anno 372&mdash;3, merely says, quoting Rhet. II 23. 25, &ldquo;From this incident it appears that Leodamas was already grown up and capable of the duties of a citizen in B.C. 404, which shews him far advanced in years at the time of the cause of Leptines, in B.C. 355.&rdquo; And this appears to me to be a sufficient account of the matter. Thrasybulus' accusation of Leodamas is mentioned likewise by Lysias, c. Evandr. &sect; 13, et seq. </p>
						<p>The circumstances referred to in this accusation and defence, and the meaning and intention of the inscription which Leodamas is said to have effaced, are not quite clear. The use of the <foreign lang="greek">στήλη</foreign> or pillar here referred to was twofold: the object of it in either case was the same, to perpetuate the memory of some act or character to all future time. But the fact or character commemorated might be either good or evil; and in the former case it was the name of a public benefactor, in the latter of some signal malefactor or public enemy, that was inscribed. It is usual to apply the latter explanation to the case here in question, which is probably what is meant; and then it seems the story must be this:&mdash;At some uncertain time previous to the expulsion of the thirty tyrants and their Lacedaemonian supporters by Thrasybulus and his friends, the recovery of the city, and restoration of the demus in 403 B.C., the name of Leodamas had been inscribed as a mark of infamy&mdash;as a traitor to his country, as Sauppe u. s. and Herm. <hi rend="italic">Pol. Ant.</hi> &sect; 144. 11 interpret it&mdash;according to custom on a pillar erected in the Acropolis for that purpose. Now if it was &lsquo;hatred to the demus&rsquo; that was engraved on it (<foreign lang="greek">ἐγγεγραμμένης</foreign>) as <pb n="292"/> the sign and cause of his imputed infamy, it follows that it must have been erected at some period when the popular party was in the ascendant; Leodamas of course being a supporter of the oligarchs. When his friends were in power and he had the opportunity, Thrasybulus charges him, <hi rend="italic">inter alia</hi> of course, with having &lsquo;struck or cut it out&rsquo; to efface the record. He denies the possibility of their <hi rend="italic">effect</hi> by arguing the absence of all assignable <hi rend="italic">cause</hi>, which could have produced it: for this permanent record of his &lsquo;hostility to the people&rsquo; would have been an additional recommendation to the Thirty, who would have trusted him all the more for it. Thrasybulus, says Victorius, was accusing Leodamas of being an enemy and a traitor to his country; and one of the arguments he brought forward was the existence of this inscription, the subsequent disappearance of which he attempted to explain. He likewise cites in illustration of the use of the topic Cic. pro Mil. &sect; 32, cum ostendere vellet insidiatorem fuisse Clodium. <hi rend="italic">quonam igitur pacto probari potest insidias Miloni fecisse Clodium? satis est quidem in illa tam audaci tam nefaria bellua docere magnam ei caussam, magnam spem in Milonis morte propositam, magnas utilitates fuisse.</hi> And, as Cic. goes on to remark, this is <hi rend="italic">Cassianum illud, cui bono fuerit.</hi> </p>
						<p>Of <foreign lang="greek">στήλη</foreign> the pillar, and <foreign lang="greek">στηλίτης</foreign>, the person whose name is engraved on it, in its unfavourable sense, where the inscription is a record of infamy&mdash;which may be compared with our use of the pillory, the custom of <hi rend="italic">posting</hi> the name of a defaulter at the Stock Exchange, or a candidate who has disgraced himself in an examination; the object in each case being the same, exposure of the culprit, and a warning to others<note anchored="yes">At Milan, says Manzoni, Introd. to the &lsquo;<hi rend="italic">Storia della colonna infame</hi>,&rsquo; in 1830, the judges condemned to the most horrible tortures some persons who were accused of having helped to spread the plague, and in addition to other severe penalties, <hi rend="italic">decretaron di piu, che in quello spazio</hi> (where the house of one of the condemned had stood) <hi rend="italic">s' innalzasse una colonna, la quale dovesse chiamarsi infame, con un' iscrizione che tramandasse ai posteri la notizia dell' attentato et della pena.

You say, My client cannot be guilty of the act with which you charge him, for he could have done it much better, would be much more likely to have been successful, in some other way; at some other time, and place, or under other circumstances: therefore, since he has <hi rend="italic">not</hi> chosen to do the thing in the best way that he could, and at the same time had full knowledge of what <hi rend="italic">was</hi> the best way of doing it, it is plain that he has not done it now under less favourable circumstances. This is excellently illustrated by Victorius from another passage of Cic. pro Mil. XVI 41. In retorting upon Clodius the charge of lying in wait to assassinate, he first enumerates several favourable opportunities which Milo had previously neglected to avail himself of, and asks whether it was likely that, having acted thus, he should now choose an occasion when time and circumstances were so much less favourable, to carry out such a design: <hi rend="italic">Quem igitur cum omnium gratia noluit</hi> (occidere), <hi rend="italic">hunc voluit cum aliquorum querela? quem iure, quem loco, quem tempore, quem impune non est ausus, hunc iniuria, iniquo loco, alieno tempore, periculo capitis, non dubitavit occidere?</hi> </p>

Brandis, &ldquo;in any mistake that has been made to find a ground of accusation or defence.&rdquo; </p>
						<p>&lsquo;For instance, in Carcinus' Medea, the one party (of the disputants in the play) charge her with the death of her children&mdash;at all events (say they) they no where appear: because Medea made a mistake in (in respect of) sending away her children (instead of merely sending them away, they argued that she had made away with them, since they were no where to be found): her defence is, that it was not her children, but Jason, that she would have killed (if she had killed any one); for she would have made a mistake in failing to do this, if she had done the other too&rsquo;: and of such a mistake she never could have been guilty. &ldquo;Quasi dicat, quomodo tam stulta fuissem' (how could I have made such a mistake?) &lsquo;ut innocentes filios necassem; perfidum autem coniugem e&lt;*&gt; auctorem omnium meorum malorum relinquerem?&rdquo; Victorius. </p>
						<p>Carcinus, a tragic poet contemporary with Aristophanes, and his sons, Philocles, Xenotimus, and Xenocles, are often mentioned by Aristophanes, never without ridicule.

There was at all events one other tragic poet of the name, whom Meineke supposes to have been the grandson of the former, p. 506, being said by Suidas to be the son of Xenocles (or Theodectes). This Carcinus flourished according to Suidas &lsquo;before the reign of Philip of Macedon&rsquo;, in the first half of the 4th cent. B.C.

B 6, 112 <hi rend="italic">a</hi> 32, to consider the derivation and signification of names with a view to applying them as suits the immediate purpose: which coincides more nearly with Cicero's topic, <hi rend="italic">quum ex vi nominis argumentum elicitur, quam Graeci</hi> <foreign lang="greek">ἐτυμολογίαν</foreign> <hi rend="italic">vocant</hi> Top.

						<p>Quintilian, V 10. 30, 31, thinks that an argument can seldom be drawn from a surname, except in the case of such significant names as are assigned <hi rend="italic">for a reason</hi>, as <hi rend="italic">Sapiens</hi> (Cato and Laelius), <hi rend="italic">Magnus</hi> (Pompey), and <hi rend="italic">Plenus</hi> (<hi rend="italic">?</hi>): or where the name is not significant, but suggests a crime&mdash;as the name Cornelius, in the case of Lentulus, was suggestive of conspiracy (for a reason there given). The use of the name recommended by Aristotle's topic (which he does not mention) is pronounced, in the case of Euripides&mdash;who represents Eteocles as attacking the name of his brother Polynices, <foreign lang="greek">πολὺ νεῖκος</foreign>, <hi rend="italic">ut argumentum morum</hi>&mdash; as insipid and tasteless, <hi rend="italic">frigidum.</hi> It is however &lsquo;a frequent material for jokes; especially in the hands of Cicero, who freely employs it, as in the case of Verres&rsquo;. The passage of Euripides referred to, is Phoen. 636&mdash;7; Eteocles terminates the altercation with his brother with the two lines, <foreign lang="greek">ἔξιθ’  ἐκ χώρας· ἀληθῶς δ̓ ὄνομα Πολυνείκῃ πατὴρ ἔθετο σοι θείᾳ προνοίᾳ νεικέων ἐπώνυμον</foreign>. With this use of significant names all readers of the Greek Tragic poets are familiar. It is not to be regarded in them as a mere play on words, but they read in the significant name the character or destiny of its bearer: and thus employed they have a true tragic interest. It is singular therefore that Elmsley, who had certainly studied the Greek dramatists with care and attention, should, on Bacch. 508, after citing a number of examples, end his note with this almost incredible observation, &ldquo;Haec non modo <foreign lang="greek">ψυχρά</foreign> sunt&rdquo; (is the epithet borrowed from Quintilian?), &ldquo;verum etiam tragicos malos fuisse grammaticos. Quid enim commune habent <foreign lang="greek">Ἀπόλλων</foreign> et <foreign lang="greek">ἀπολλύναι</foreign> praeter soni similitudinem?&rdquo; And this is all that is suggested by Ajax's pathetic exclamation, <foreign lang="greek">αἶ αἶ τίς ἄν ποτ’  ᾤετ̓ κ.τ.λ.</foreign> Soph. Aj. 430, and the rest! Elmsley has omitted Aesch. S. c. T. 658, <foreign lang="greek">ἐπωνύμῳ δὲ κάρτα Πολυνείκη λέγω</foreign>, from his list; and Eur.

These may sometimes be substituted for their proper names, and may furnish <hi rend="italic">arguments of praise.</hi> </p>
						<p>The Conon and Thrasybulus here mentioned are doubtless, as may be inferred from the absence of any special designation, <hi rend="italic">the</hi> Conon, the victor of Cnidus (394 B. C.), and <hi rend="italic">the</hi> Thrasybulus, the expeller of the Thirty and restorer of the demus in 403: though there are several others bearing both of these names in Sauppe's <hi rend="italic">Ind. Nom. ad Or. Att.</hi> III. pp. 63, 4, 81, 2. Thrasybulus is named by Demosth., de Cor. &sect; 219, as one of the most distinguished orators among his predecessors, together with Callistratus, Aristophon, and Cephalus; the two first of these we have had mentioned in the Rhetoric. In de F. L. &sect; 320, he is called <foreign lang="greek">τοῦ δημοτικοῦ</foreign> (the popular Thrasybulus, the people's friend, <foreign lang="greek">καὶ τοῦ ἀπὸ Φυλῆς καταγαγόντος τὸν δῆμον</foreign>. Conon and he were contemporaries. Conon died soon after 392 B. C., Clinton, <hi rend="italic">F. H. sub anno</hi> 388. 3, Thrasybulus, &ldquo;perhaps in the beginning of B.C. 389.&rdquo; Ib. <hi rend="italic">sub anno</hi> 390. His name, according to Conon, fitly represented the <hi rend="italic">rashness</hi> of his <hi rend="italic">counsels</hi> and character. Grote, <hi rend="italic">H. G.</hi> IX 509 [chap. LXXV.], in describing the character of Thrasybulus, omits to notice this. </p>
						<p>In like manner the name of Thrasymachus, the rhetorician, is significant of the <hi rend="italic">hardihood</hi> and <hi rend="italic">pugnacity</hi> which were combined in his character. The sketch given of him in the first book of Plato's Republic is in exact correspondence with this. &ldquo;Always true to your name,&rdquo; rash and combative, said Herodicus to him, doubtless provoked by some rudeness of the Sophist in the course of a dialectical disputation. There were two Herodicuses, both physicians; see note on I 5. 10. Doubtless this again is the <hi rend="italic">better known</hi> of the two, Herodicus of Selymbria in Thrace; of whose medical practice Plato gives an account, Rep. III 406 A seq. In a similar dispute with Polus, another Sophist and Rhetorician, (whose character, in perfect agreement with this, is likewise sketched by Plato in his Gorgias, where he is said to be <foreign lang="greek">νέος καὶ ὀξύς</foreign><note anchored="yes">[p. 463 E.] A very brief summary of the leading points of Polus' character as he appears in the Gorgias, is given amongst the &lsquo;dramatis personae&rsquo; of the Introd. to transl. of Gorg. p. lxxvii.</note>,) Herodicus again reminds him of the significance of his name, &ldquo;Colt by <pb n="299"/> name and colt by nature<note anchored="yes">This most ingenious rendering was given by Dr Thompson, then Greek Professor, in a lecture delivered Feb. 6, 1854.

						<p>The chapter concludes with two observations on enthymemes in general.

						<p>&lsquo;But of all syllogisms destructive or constructive, such are most applauded as those of which the results are at once (at the very begining, of the argument) foreseen: not because they are superficial (<foreign lang="greek">ἐπιπολῆς</foreign>, I 15. 22, note ad loc., II 16 1)&mdash;for they (the hearers &lsquo;are pleased themselves also with themselves at the same time&rsquo;) are pleased (not only with the speaker and his enthymeme, but) with themselves also (<foreign lang="greek">ἅμα</foreign>) for their sagacity in anticipating the conclusion: (and therefore they <hi rend="italic">don't</hi> think it superficial)&mdash;and those which they are only just so far behind&mdash;which they can so nearly keep pace with&mdash;as to understand them (step by step) as they are delivered&rsquo;. </p>

					<p>In the preceding chapter a selection has been given of the topics or special classes of enthymemes which are most appropriate and serviceable in the practice of Rhetoric: and these are <foreign lang="greek">τὰ ὄντα ἐνθυμήματα</foreign>, c. 24. 11, ult., sound, genuine, logical inferences. But besides these there are, in Rhetoric as well as Dialectics, arguments apparent but not real, fallacious, illogical, which are often employed to mislead and deceive. Now, although we are to abstain from the use of these ourselves, <foreign lang="greek">οὐ γὰρ δεῖ τὰ φαῦλα πείθειν</foreign>, I 1. 12, it is necessary for the rhetorician to be thoroughly acquainted with them, in order to detect them in others and to refute any unfair reasoning which may be employed against him, (ibidem): and so vindicate the superiority of truth and right to falsehood and wrong. And accordingly we have in the following chapter a selection of the most prominent rhetorical fallacies, and in c. 25 the solution of them; corresponding respectively to the two parts of the de Soph. El. (cc. 1&mdash;15; 16, to the end), which in like manner is appended as a sequel to the Topics in which is expounded and illustrated the genuine and artistic method of the employment of the dialectical syllogism. On Fallacies in <pb n="301"/> general, see Grote's Plato, <hi rend="italic">Euthydemus</hi>, Vol. I. c. xix [Grote's <hi rend="italic">Aristotle</hi> c.X.] and J. S. Mill, <hi rend="italic">System of Logic</hi>, Vol. II. Bk. V. Whately, <hi rend="italic">Logic</hi>, ch. V. </p>
					<p>In the Topics, (de Soph. El.) c. 4, 165 <hi rend="italic">b</hi> 23, fallacious arguments are classified under two heads, <foreign lang="greek">παρὰ τὴν λέξιν</foreign>, fallacies of language, <hi rend="italic">verbal</hi>, and <foreign lang="greek">ἔξω τῆς λέξεως</foreign>, non-verbal, beyond the sphere of, not dependent upon mere <hi rend="italic">words; logical</hi> fallacies. &ldquo;Alterum vitium positum est in prava verborum interpretatione (<hi rend="italic">wort-verdrehung</hi>), alterum in falsa argumentatione (<hi rend="italic">schluss-fehler</hi>).&rdquo; Waitz ad loc. 165 <hi rend="italic">b</hi> 23. <foreign lang="greek">ἔξω τῆς λέξεως</foreign>, <hi rend="italic">die</hi> &ldquo;<hi rend="italic">welche in den ausdruck ihren grund nicht haben.</hi>&rdquo; Brandis, u. s.

Verbal fallacies are six in number: (1) <foreign lang="greek">ὁμωνυμία</foreign>, equivocal, ambiguous, <hi rend="italic">terms</hi>, <foreign lang="greek">τὸ πλεοναχῶς λεγόμενον</foreign>; (2) <foreign lang="greek">ἀμφιβολία</foreign>, <hi rend="italic">general</hi> ambiguity in <hi rend="italic">language</hi>, ambiguous <hi rend="italic">expressions</hi>, &ldquo;ambiguous <hi rend="italic">propositions</hi>,&rdquo; Poste; (these two may be distinguished as here; or, as in Poet. XXV 21, identified, under the one general term <foreign lang="greek">ἀμφιβολία</foreign>, &lsquo;ambiguity in expression&rsquo;: in the explanation of them, Top. u. s. 166 <hi rend="italic">a</hi> 14 seq., we have <foreign lang="greek">ἢ ὁ λόγος</foreign> the proposition, or combination of words, <foreign lang="greek">ἢ τοὔνομα</foreign>, the single word, the <foreign lang="greek">ὁμώνυμον</foreign>); (3) <foreign lang="greek">σύνθεσις</foreign> and (4) <foreign lang="greek">διαίρεσις</foreign>, explained and illustrated Top. ibid. 166 <hi rend="italic">a</hi> 22&mdash;38, illicit combination and separation of words; (5) <foreign lang="greek">προσῳδία</foreign>, accent, pronunciation&mdash;which is of more use in criticising written composition, especially poetry; in Dialectics, where there is no written text, <foreign lang="greek">ἄνευ γραφῆς</foreign>, it is of little or none. Ibid. <hi rend="italic">b</hi> 1; and (6th and last), <foreign lang="greek">παρὰ τὸ σχῆμα τῆς λέξεως</foreign>, &lsquo;in figura dictionis,&rsquo; Waitz, fallacies or ambiguities, arising from the confusion of (assuming the apparent for the real,) different categories&mdash;&ldquo;categories, that is, in their <hi rend="italic">grammatical</hi> acceptation, as predicates, or a classification of the parts of speech; when, owing to similarity of (grammatical) form, a thing is referred to the wrong category&rdquo; (Waitz, note ad loc.). And as this difference of categorical predication is expressed in the <hi rend="italic">termination</hi> of words, it may be otherwise represented as &ldquo;a similarity (or identity) of termination,&rdquo; which leads to fallacy (Poste, Transl. of de Soph. El.). Thus the termination <foreign lang="greek">-ειν</foreign> (which marks the infinitive of a verb) in <foreign lang="greek">ὑγιαίνειν</foreign> implies &lsquo;some quality or disposition of a thing&rsquo;, (as we say, it is a <hi rend="italic">neuter</hi> verb), i. e. belongs to the category of <foreign lang="greek">ποιότης ἔχειν</foreign>: in <foreign lang="greek">τέμνειν</foreign> or <foreign lang="greek">οἰκοδομεῖν</foreign>, it implies action, <foreign lang="greek">ποιεῖν</foreign>; i. e. it is an active verb; belongs to the category of <foreign lang="greek">ποιεῖν</foreign>. Similarly from a masculine noun with a feminine termination, or the reverse, and a neuter with either one or the other; Ibid. <hi rend="italic">b</hi> 10&mdash;19. &ldquo;<hi rend="italic">falsche grammatische form.</hi>&rdquo; Brandis, u. s. p. 22. </p>
					<p>Of these, accent, division (probably including the opposite), and <foreign lang="greek">ἀμφιβολία</foreign>, including <foreign lang="greek">ὁμωνυμία</foreign>, are illustrated from the poets in Poet. XXV 18&mdash;20. There is a fourth, &sect; 21, <foreign lang="greek">κατὰ τὸ ἔθος τῆς λέξεως</foreign>, which may be brought under the more general topic of the dialectical treatise, <foreign lang="greek">παρὰ τὸ σχῆμα τῆς λέξεως</foreign>. </p>
					<p>Of these dialectical topics four are transferred to Rhetoric: <foreign lang="greek">ὁμωνυμία</foreign>, including <foreign lang="greek">ἀμφιβολία</foreign>, &sect; 2; and <foreign lang="greek">σύνθεσις</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">διαίρεσις</foreign>, together, as one topic, &sect; 3. <foreign lang="greek">σχῆμα τῆς λέξεως</foreign>, &sect; 2, stands for a <hi rend="italic">fallacy of language</hi> quite different to that which bears its name in the Topics. The difference is explained in the note on &sect; 2. </p>
					<p>Fallacies <foreign lang="greek">ἔξω τῆς λέξεως</foreign>, in the Topics are seven. (1) <foreign lang="greek">παρὰ τὸ συμβεβηκός</foreign>, from the confusion of subject and accident; (2) of absolute <pb n="302"/> (<foreign lang="greek">ἁπλῶς</foreign>) and particular or qualified (<foreign lang="greek">κατά τι</foreign>, or <foreign lang="greek">πῇ ἢ ποῦ ἢ ποτὲ ἢ πρός τι</foreign>) statements; (3) <foreign lang="greek">ἐλέγχου ἄγνοια</foreign>, <hi rend="italic">ignoratio elenchi</hi>, &ldquo;an inadequate notion of confutation,&rdquo; Poste, &ldquo;inscitiae eorum quae ad redarguendum pertinent,&rdquo; Waitz; (4) <foreign lang="greek">τὸ ἐν ἀρχῇ λαμβάνειν</foreign>, <hi rend="italic">petitio principii</hi>, begging the question, assuming the thing to be proved; (5) <foreign lang="greek">τὸ μὴ αἴτιον ὡς αἴτιον τιθέναι</foreign>, &ldquo;in ratione non recte reddita,&rdquo; Waitz, the assumption of not-cause for cause; (6) <foreign lang="greek">παρὰ τὸ ἑπόμενον</foreign>, the assumption that antecedent and consequent are always and reciprocally convertible: that if B follows A, A must follow B. (The order of these two last is inverted in the explanation; 167 <hi rend="italic">b</hi> 1 and 21.) (7) <foreign lang="greek">τὸ τὰ δύο ἐρωτήματα ἓν ποιεῖν</foreign>, to put two (or more) questions as one, &lsquo;when it escapes observation that the question is not one but several, and one answer is returned, as though it were one&rsquo;. De Soph. El. c. 5, 166 <hi rend="italic">b</hi> 20&mdash;27, where there is a summary enumeration of them; and to the end of the chapter, 168 <hi rend="italic">a</hi> 16, where they are explained at length and exemplified. </p>
					<p>Of these (1) &sect; 6 (these two are the same only in <hi rend="italic">name;</hi> see on &sect; 6); (2) &sect;&sect; 9, 10; (5) &sect; 8; and (6) &sect; 7, occur also in the Rhetoric. <foreign lang="greek">ἐκ σημείου</foreign>, &sect; 5, falls under the head of <foreign lang="greek">τὰ ἑπόμενα</foreign>; de Soph. El. 167 <hi rend="italic">b</hi> 8, <foreign lang="greek">ἔν τε τοῖς ῥητορικοῖς αἱ κατὰ τὸ σημεῖον ἀποδείξεις ἐκ τῶν ἑπομένων εἰσίν</foreign>. The remaining three (3) (4) (7), are found only in the dialectical treatise. Brandis, u. s. p. 22, expresses his surprise at the omission of these three, and thinks that it argues the later date of the de Soph. El.; though of the priority of the Topics there can be no doubt. Vahlen, <hi rend="italic">Trans. Acad. Vien.</hi> Oct. 1861, p. 134, pronounces this to be very doubtful; and proceeds to argue in favour of the earlier date of composition for <hi rend="italic">both</hi> treatises. Besides these we have the purely rhetorical topic of <foreign lang="greek">δείνωσις</foreign>, aggravation, exaggeration, &sect; 4. The paradox or fallacy, <foreign lang="greek">εἰκὸς καὶ τὸ παρὰ τὸ εἰκός</foreign>, or <foreign lang="greek">ἔσται τὸ μὴ εἰκὸς εἰκός</foreign>, and also <foreign lang="greek">τὸ τὸν ἥττω λόγον κρείττω ποιεῖν</foreign>, both come under the head of <foreign lang="greek">παρὰ τὸ ἁπλῶς καὶ μὴ ἁπλῶς, ἀλλὰ τί</foreign>, No. (2), &sect; 10. </p>

						<p>&lsquo;Topics of unreal enthymemes are, first, the fallacy that arises from the language&rsquo; (<foreign lang="greek">παρὰ τὴν λέξιν</foreign>, as Victorius also notes, is <hi rend="italic">not</hi> &lsquo;against&rsquo;, but &lsquo;along of&rsquo;, Arnold's Thuc. I 141. 9; like <foreign lang="greek">διά</foreign>, &lsquo;arising from&rsquo;, &lsquo;shewn in&rsquo;, as <foreign lang="greek">παρὰ τὴν ὁμωνυμίαν</foreign>, &sect; 2, <foreign lang="greek">παρὰ τὴν ἔλλειψιν</foreign>, &sect;&sect; 3, 9); &lsquo;and of this one part (sort or kind),&mdash;<hi rend="italic">as</hi> in dialectics, to omit or evade the syllogistic process (that is, to assume without proof) and then in the terms of a syllogistic conclusion to state the result, &ldquo;<hi rend="italic">therefore</hi> it is <hi rend="italic">not</hi> so and so <pb n="303"/> (the conclusion of an <foreign lang="greek">ἔλεγχος</foreign> or syllogism of refutation of an opponent's thesis) or, <hi rend="italic">therefore</hi> necessarily so and so follows&rdquo; (conclusion of a demonstrative, constructive, syllogism);&mdash;<hi rend="italic">so</hi> in enthymemes (Rhetoric) the enunciation of a concise, condensed, well-<hi rend="italic">rounded</hi> or turned, periodic&rsquo; (<foreign lang="greek">συνεστραμμένως</foreign>, Plat. Protag. 342 E: on <foreign lang="greek">ἡ κατεστραμμένη λέξις</foreign>, Introd. p. 308 seq. on III 9. 3) &lsquo;and antithetical sentence passes for an enthymeme&rsquo;. The <hi rend="italic">completeness</hi> in the structure of the period, which &ldquo;like a circle returns into itself&rdquo;, its carefully balanced members, and its antithetical epigrammatic character, have the effect of an argument and supply to the deluded listener the lacking proof. The force of the antithesis and epigram in conversation and discussion is too well known to need further illustration. I have followed Vahlen, who has discussed this sentence at length in his paper, already referred to, <hi rend="italic">zur kritik Arist. Schrift.</hi> (<hi rend="italic">Trans. Acad. Vien.</hi> Oct. 1861, pp. 136&mdash;8), in removing the fullstop at <foreign lang="greek">τὸ καὶ τό</foreign> and reading <foreign lang="greek">καὶ ἐν</foreign> for <foreign lang="greek">καὶ τό</foreign>: or perhaps the simple omission of <foreign lang="greek">τό</foreign> would be sufficient. He apologises for the anacoluthon, and the repetition of <foreign lang="greek">ἐνθύμημα</foreign> at the end of the sentence, and proposes two expedients for getting rid of them; unnecessarily as it seems to me: accepting the two alterations, as I have done, the sense is perfect, and the expression of it quite in character with the author's hasty and careless style. I pass over the attempted explanations of Vater and others. Victorius has given the sense correctly, though his interpretation does not adhere closely to <hi rend="italic">his</hi> text. Bekker and Spengel leave the passage unaltered. </p>
						<p>The words of de Soph. El. 15, 174 <hi rend="italic">b</hi> 8 (comp. 18, 176 <hi rend="italic">b</hi> 32), <foreign lang="greek">τὸ μάλιστα σοφιστικὸν συκοφάντημα τῶν ἐρωτώντων, τὸ μηδὲν συλλογισαμένους μὴ ἐρώτημα ποιεῖν τὸ τελευταῖον, ἀλλὰ συμπεραντικῶς εἰπεῖν, ὡς συλλελογισμένους, οὐκ ἄρα τὸ καὶ τό</foreign>, present an unusually close correspondence in word as well as sense with this parallel passage of the Rhetoric: few I think will agree with Brandis in supposing the dialectical treatise to be the later of the two compositions. </p>
						<p>&lsquo;For such a style&rsquo;&mdash;this condensed and antithetical, <hi rend="italic">periodic</hi>, style, the style of Demosthenes and Isocrates,&mdash;&lsquo;is the proper seat of enthymeme&rsquo;. <foreign lang="greek">χώρα</foreign> the region or district, <hi rend="italic">sedes</hi>, where enthymemes are to be found; their haunt or habitat: precisely like <foreign lang="greek">τόπος</foreign>, <hi rend="italic">locus</hi>, on which see Introd. pp. 124, 5, and the quotations from Cic. and Quint. So Victorius, &ldquo;sedes et tanquam regio enth.&rdquo; It cannot possibly be &lsquo;form&rsquo;, as Vahlen renders it, (if I do not misunderstand him,) u. s., p. 137, <hi rend="italic">die dem Enth. eigenth&uuml;mliche Form.</hi> </p>
						<p>With the statement compare III 9. 8, of antithesis, <foreign lang="greek">ἡδεῖα δ’  ἐστὶν ἡ τοιαύτη λέξις,...καὶ ὅτι ἔοικε συλλογισμῷ· ὁ γὰρ ἔλεγχος συναγωγὴ τῶν ἀντικειμένων ἐστίν</foreign>. III 18. 4, <foreign lang="greek">τὰ ἐνθυμήματα ὅτι μάλιστα συστρέφειν δεῖ</foreign>. </p>
						<p>&lsquo;A fallacy of this kind seems to arise from the fashion of&rsquo; (the style <pb n="304"/> of) &lsquo;language used&rsquo;, (i. e. the periodical and antithetical construction of the sentences). Such I think <hi rend="italic">must</hi> be the interpretation of <foreign lang="greek">σχῆμα τῆς λέξεως</foreign>, though it differs <hi rend="italic">in toto</hi> from the signification of the phrase in Top. (de Soph. El.) 4, 166 <hi rend="italic">b</hi> 10, the 6th of the verbal fallacies (see above). Vahlen, u. s., points out this difference, which is sufficiently obvious. Nevertheless Victorius identifies them. Both of them may no doubt be referred to the head of fallacies of language&mdash;in its most general sense; but the dialectical topic is a mistake or misuse of the termination of single words, involving a confusion of categories; the rhetorical is <hi rend="italic">an abuse of language</hi> in a totally different application. </p>
						<p>&lsquo;For the purpose of conveying by the language the appearance of syllogistic reasoning it is serviceable to recite (enumerate) the heads (of the results) of many syllogisms (previous trains of reasoning); &ldquo;some he saved, and on the others he took vengeance, and the Greeks he set at liberty&rdquo;&rsquo;: (this is from Isocr. Evag. &sect;&sect; 65&mdash;9, as Spengel has pointed out, <hi rend="italic">Tract. on Rhet.</hi> in <hi rend="italic">Trans. Bav. Acad.</hi> 1851, p. 22 note. Aristotle has gathered into these three <hi rend="italic">heads</hi> of the contents of Isocr.'s five sections. The person of whom this is said is of course Evagoras, the hero of the declamation. The same speech has been already referred to, II 23. 12): &lsquo;for each of these points was already proved from something else, but when they are put together, it seems as if some additional (<foreign lang="greek">καί</foreign>) conclusion might be drawn from them&rsquo;. </p>

This is taken beyond all doubt from Polycrates' panegyrical declamation, &lsquo;the Encomium of <pb n="305"/> mice&rsquo;, referred to in &sect; 6: see the note there. The ambiguity from which the fallacious inference is drawn is of course the assumed derivation from <foreign lang="greek">μῦς</foreign> instead of <foreign lang="greek">μύειν</foreign>. If mysteries are <hi rend="italic">derived from</hi> mice, how great must be the honour due to the little animal. See Whately, <hi rend="italic">Logic</hi>, ch. v. &sect; 8, on ambiguous middle. </p>

Schrader under<pb n="306"/> stands it thus: &ldquo;ne canem quidem in domo ali sordidum est. Ergo canem esse honorificum est.&rdquo; He goes on to say that the equivocation lies in the double meaning of <foreign lang="greek">κύων</foreign>, <hi rend="italic">dog</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Cynic</hi><note anchored="yes">On this name as applied to Antisthenes, compare the epigram in Diog. Laert. VI 1. 10, which interprets it thus, <foreign lang="greek">τὸν βίον ἦσθα κύων, Ἀντίσθενες, ὧδε πεφυκὼς ὥστε δακεῖν κραδίην ῥήμασιν οὐ στόμασιν</foreign>, and to Diogenes, VI 2. 60, 61.</note>. &ldquo;Cynici enim philosophi Canes appellabantur, qui hac fallacia cognomen istud suum ornare poterant.&rdquo; The argument is, &lsquo;To have no dog at all is the highest disgrace&rsquo; (would this be accepted as <hi rend="italic">probable?</hi>); &lsquo;therefore to be a dog (in another sense, a Cynic,) is plainly a mark of distinction.&rsquo; </p>
						<p>&lsquo;And to say that Hermes is the most liberal&rsquo; (communicative of good things to others (so Schrader); or &lsquo;sociable&rsquo;, communicative of himself, <hi rend="italic">superis deorum gratus et imis</hi>,) &lsquo;of all the gods; for he alone goes by the name of <hi rend="italic">Common</hi> Hermes&rsquo;. The latter of the two interpretations of <foreign lang="greek">κοινωνικόν</foreign> seems to be right, from the comparison of Polit. III 13, 1283 <hi rend="italic">a</hi> 38, where justice is said to be a <foreign lang="greek">κοινωνικὴ ἀρετή, ᾗ πάσας ἀναγκαῖον ἀκολουθεῖν τὰς ἄλλας</foreign>. <hi rend="italic">Eine der b&uuml;rgerlichen gesellschaft wesentliche tugend</hi>, i. e. social, (Stahr). The fallacy lies in transferring the <hi rend="italic">special</hi> signification of <foreign lang="greek">κοινός</foreign> <hi rend="italic">in the</hi> proverb, and applying it in a <hi rend="italic">general</hi> sense to the character of the god. </p>
						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">κοινὸς Ἑρμῆς</lemma>] Hermes is the god of &lsquo;luck&rsquo;, to whom all <foreign lang="greek">ἕρμαια</foreign>, windfalls, lucky finds, pieces of good fortune, are due. When a man finds anything, as a coin which has been dropt in the street, his companion immediately puts in a claim to &lsquo;go halves&rsquo;, with the proverbial &ldquo;Common Hermes&rdquo;, i. e. luck is common, I am entitled to share with you. Theophr. Char. XXX, <foreign lang="greek">καὶ εὑρισκομένων χαλκῶν ἐν ταῖς ὁδοῖς ὑπὸ τῶν οἰκείων δεινὸς</foreign> (<foreign lang="greek">ὁ αἰσχροκερδὴς</foreign>) <foreign lang="greek">ἀπαιτῆσαι τὸ μέρος, κοινὸν εἶναι φήσας τὸν Ἑρμῆν</foreign>. Hesychius, <foreign lang="greek">κοινὸς Ἑρμῆς ἐπὶ τῶν κοινῇ τε εὑρισκόντων</foreign>. Plutarch, Phil. esse cum princ. c. 2, <foreign lang="greek">ἀλλ’  ἀμουσίᾳ καὶ ἀπειροκαλίᾳ τὸν κοινὸν Ἑρμῆν ἐμπόλαιον καὶ ἔμμισθον γενέσθαι</foreign> (apud Erasm. <hi rend="italic">Adag.</hi> Liberalitas, &lsquo;Communis Mercurius&rsquo;, p. 1144, ed. 1599), the god of gain, profit, luck, has ceased to be as of old <hi rend="italic">common</hi> and liberal, and has taken to commerce and mercenary habits. Lucian, Navig. &sect; 12; Adimantus had spoken of some golden visions, to which Lycinus replies, <foreign lang="greek">οὐκοῦν τὸ προχειρότατον τοῦτο, κοινὸς Ἑρμῆς, φασί, καὶ ἐς μέσον κατατίθει φέρων τὸν πλοῦτον</foreign> (let me, as the proverb <foreign lang="greek">κοινὸς Ἑρμῆς</foreign> has it, share your wealth), <foreign lang="greek">ἄξιον γὰρ ἀπολαῦσαι τὸ μέρος φίλους ὄντας</foreign>.

						<p>&lsquo;And, to prove that words&rsquo; (speech, rhetoric; this is probably taken from an encomium on the art) &lsquo;are a most excellent, valuable thing; for the reason that the proper reward of good men is, not money, but <foreign lang="greek">λόγος</foreign> (in the double sense of &lsquo;words&rsquo;, and &lsquo;consideration, estimation&rsquo;; <foreign lang="greek">λόγου ποιεῖσθαι</foreign> (<foreign lang="greek">ἔχειν</foreign>) <foreign lang="greek">τινός, ἐν οὐδενὶ λόγῳ εἶναι</foreign>, et similia passim); &lsquo;for <foreign lang="greek">λόγου</foreign> <pb n="307"/> <foreign lang="greek">ἄξιον</foreign> is an ambiguous, equivocal expression&rsquo; (is used in more than one sense). </p>

						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">σύνθεσις</lemma> and <foreign lang="greek">διαίρεσις</foreign>, &lsquo;wrong (fallacious) combination, composition, and disjunction, separation, in reading or speaking&rsquo;, which are here taken together as one form of fallacy, are two in de Soph. El. c. 4, 165 <hi rend="italic">b</hi> 26, Ib. 166 <hi rend="italic">a</hi> 22, and 33. The solution of them is given in c. 20, where &ldquo;Euthydemus' argument&rdquo; is also referred to, and thence no doubt transferred hither. </p>
						<p>&lsquo;Another is, to pronounce in combination what is (properly, or is intended to be) separated, or the reverse, the combined as separate: for since it seems to be the same either way (when combined or separated, and it is in this appearance, and the advantage taken of it, that the fallacy lies), whichever of the two happens to be more serviceable, <hi rend="italic">that</hi> must be done&rsquo;. <foreign lang="greek">δεῖ</foreign> does not here imply a moral obligation; it is not intended to recommend the practice; the only obligation is that which is imposed by the art; <hi rend="italic">if</hi> you want to avail yourself of this unfair mode of reasoning (which I don't say I approve, I am only stating what the art requires), this is the way to proceed. </p>
						<p>&lsquo;This is Euthydemus' argument. For instance to know that a trireme is in the Piraeus, because he knows each (of two things which are here omitted)&rsquo;. This example, which is unintelligible as it stands here, has some further light (or obscurity) thrown on it by the form in which it occurs in de Soph. El. c. 20, 177 <hi rend="italic">b</hi> 12, <foreign lang="greek">καὶ ὁ Εὐθυδήμου δὲ λόγος, ἆρ’  οἶδας σὺ νῦν οὔσας ἐν Πειραιεῖ τριήρεις ἐν Σικελίᾳ ὤν</foreign>; but in both much is left to be supplied, the argument alluded to being supposed to be well known, and in every one's recollection. Schrader thus fills up the argument:&mdash;What you know, you know in the Piraeus&mdash;where the two disputants were standing&mdash;this is admitted: but you know also that there are triremes: this also is conceded, because the respondent knows that the Athenians have triremes somewhere; out at sea, or in Sicily, (referring to the expedition of 415 B.C.): whence the conclusion, you know that there are triremes in the Piraeus. The illicit combination (<foreign lang="greek">σύνθεσις</foreign>) in this interpretation&mdash; though Schrader does not explain it further&mdash;must lie in the conjunction of the Piraeus with the knowledge of triremes, to which it does not belong in the respondent's interpretation of the question: and <foreign lang="greek">ἕκαστον</foreign> will be &lsquo;each of these two pieces of knowledge, the knowledge of what is known in the Piraeus, and of the triremes&rsquo;. They are both known separately, Euthydemus illicitly combines them. </p>
						<p>This seems to be a reasonable explanation of the example <hi rend="italic">so far as it is given in the Rhetoric.</hi> But it seems quite certain that Aristotle is <pb n="308"/> quoting identically the same argument in de Soph. El. The triremes and the Piraeus appear in both, and both are styled <foreign lang="greek">Εὐθυδήμου λόγος</foreign>, the well-known argument of Euthydemus. Schrader, though he refers to the passage, takes no account of the words <foreign lang="greek">ἐν Σικελία ὤν</foreign>, which it seems must have formed part of it. Victorius has endeavoured to combine both in his explanation of the fallacy&mdash;I am not at all sure that I understand it: I will therefore transcribe it in his own words <hi rend="italic">verbatim et litteratim.</hi> &ldquo;Tu scis te esse in Piraeo: quod concedebatur ipsi (the respondent), ac verum erat. Scis triremes Atheniensium esse in Sicilia (miserant enim eo classem ut eam insulam occuparent); id quoque non inficiabatur qui interrogatus erat. Tu scis igitur (aiebat ille) in Piraeo triremes esse, in Sicilia existens. Qua captione ipsum in Sicilia, scire triremes esse in Piraeo cogebatur; cum eo namque, scire in Piraeo, coniungebatur triremes esse: a quo remotum primo pronunciatum fuerat: ab illo vero, in Sicilia, cum quo copulatum editum primo fuerat, disiungebatur: atque ita efficiebatur ipsum, in Sicilia cum esset, scire in Piraeo triremes esse. Quod vero hic adiungit <foreign lang="greek">ἕκαστον γὰρ οἶδεν</foreign>: separatim scilicet utrunque nosse intelligit, se in portu Atheniensium tunc esse: triremesque item in Sicilia. E quorum conglutinatione fallax ratio conflata, quae inde vocata est <foreign lang="greek">παρὰ σύνθεσιν</foreign>.&rdquo; By this must be meant, that the two statements, existence or knowledge in the Piraeus, and knowledge of triremes in Sicily, which ought to be kept separate, are combined in one statement, and hence the fallacy: true separately, they are not true together. Whether this is a satisfactory version of Euthydemus' fallacy I fear I must leave it to others to decide. My principal difficulty is as to the mode of transition from the Piraeus to Sicily in the two first propositions, which as far as I can see is not satisfactorily accounted for. What is there to connect the &lsquo;knowing that you are in the Piraeus&rsquo;, or &lsquo;knowing in the Piraeus&rsquo;, with knowing or being in Sicily? And yet there must be some connexion, apparent at least if not real, to make the fallacy plausible. This is nevertheless Alexander's solution of it. Comm. ad Top. 177 <hi rend="italic">b</hi> 12, <foreign lang="greek">τὸν δὲ λόγον ἠρώτα ὁ Εὐθύδημος ἐν Πειραιεῖ τυγχάνων, ὅτε αἱ τῶν Ἀθηναίων τριήρεις εἰς Σικελίαν ἦλθον. ἔστι δὲ ἡ τοῦ σοφίσματος ἀγωγὴ τοιαύτη. ἆρα γε σὺ νῦν ἐν Πειραιεῖ εἶ; ναί. ἆρ’  οἶδας ἐν Σικελίᾳ τριήρεις οὔσας; ναί. ἆρα οἶδας σὺ νῦν οὔσας ἐν Πειραιεῖ τριήρεις ἐν Σικελίᾳ ὤν; παρὰ τὴν σύνθεσιν τὸ σοφίσμα</foreign>. However this may be, at any rate, if Plato's dialogue is to be trusted, there is no kind of fallacy however silly, transparent, and contemptible, of which Euthydemus and his partner were incapable; and the weight of authority, notwithstanding the utter want of sense, must decide us to accept this explanation. </p>
						<p>Of Euthydemus, and his brother and fellow-sophist Dionysodorus, contemporaries of Socrates, nearly all that we know is derived from Plato's Euthydemus. They had studied and taught the art military, <pb n="309"/> and the forensic branch of Rhetoric, Euthyd. 273, C. D, before entering at an advanced age upon their present profession, viz. that of <foreign lang="greek">ἐριστική</foreign>, the art of sophistical disputation, and of universal confutation, by which they undertook to reduce any opponent whatsoever to silence. Many examples of their mode of arguing are given in the Platonic dialogue, but Aristotle's instance does not appear among them. See also Grote's Plato, on Euthydemus, Vol. I., ch. xix. The fallacies are exemplified from the dialogue, p. 545 seq. And on Euthydemus and his brother, also Stallbaum's Disp. de Euth. Plat. prefixed to his edition of the dialogues, p. 10 seq. (Ed. I). </p>
						<p>An example of illicit combination is given in the <foreign lang="greek">περὶ Ἑρμηνείας</foreign>, the treatise on the proposition or elementary combination of words, c. 11, p. 20 <hi rend="italic">b</hi> 35, <foreign lang="greek">ἀλλ’  οὐχί, εἰ σκυτεὺς καὶ ἀγαθός, καὶ σκυτεὺς ἀγαθός. εἰ γάρ, ὅτι ἑκάτερον ἀληθές, εἶναι δεῖ καὶ τὸ συνάμφω, πολλὰ καὶ ἄτοπα ἔσται</foreign>. </p>
						<p>&lsquo;Another example is that one that knows the letters, knows the whole verse; for the verse is the same thing (as the letters, or elements, of which it is composed)&rsquo;. The reason given, <foreign lang="greek">τὸ ἔπος τὸ αὐτό ἐστιν</foreign>, contains the fallacy. It assumes that the things combined are the same as they are separate; which is not true. </p>
						<p>&lsquo;And (thirdly) to argue, that since twice a certain amount (of food or a drug) is unwholesome, so must also the single portion be: for it is absurd to suppose that if two things separately are good, they can when combined unite into one bad&rsquo;. If the two parts together are unwholesome, neither of them can be wholesome separately, because the combination of two good things can never make one bad, This is a fallacious <hi rend="italic">confutation;</hi> of a physician, may be, who is recommending the use of a drug. You say that your drug is wholesome: now you only administer a certain quantity. Suppose you were to double it, you would not say that it was wholesome <hi rend="italic">then:</hi> but if the two parts together are unwholesome, how can either of them, the component elements being precisely the same in each, be wholesome? two wholesomes could never make an unwholesome. Here the undue combination of the double with the single part produces the fallacy (so Victorius). </p>
						<p>&lsquo;Used thus, it serves for refutation, but in the following way for proof (this is, by inverting the preceding): because one good thing cannot be (made up of) two bad&rsquo;. If the whole is good, then the two parts, which is not always true. &lsquo;But the entire topic is fallacious&rsquo;: in whichever way it is applied (Victorius). </p>
						<p>&lsquo;And again, what Polycrates said in his encomium of Thrasybulus, that he put down thirty tyrants: for he puts them all together&rsquo;. This again, which without further elucidation would not be altogether intelligible, is explained by two notices in Quintilian, III 6. 26, VII 4. 44. </p>
						<p>As an illustration of the argument from number, he gives this, <hi rend="italic">An Thrasybulo triginta praemia debeantur, qui tot tyrannos sustulerit?</hi> <pb n="310"/> Whence it appears that Polycrates had argued that he deserved thirty rewards for his services, one for each tyrant that he had expelled; an illicit combination. Spalding ad loc. III. 6, &ldquo;Hoc videtur postulasse Polycrates, qui dixit:&rdquo; quoting this passage. On Polycrates see &sect; 6, <hi rend="italic">infra.</hi> </p>
						<p>&lsquo;Or that in Theodectes' Orestes, for it is a fallacy of division: &ldquo;It is just for her that slays her husband&rdquo; to die, and for the son to avenge his father: and accordingly this is what has actually<note anchored="yes">A^{c} and three other MSS have <foreign lang="greek">οὐκοῦν καὶ ταῦτα καὶ πέπρακται</foreign>. Spengel, ed. 1867, rightly puts the first in brackets and retains the second, which I have followed in the translation.</note> been done: (but this is a fallacy) for it may be that when the two are combined, (the sum-total) is no longer just&rsquo;. Orestes, being the son of her that had slain her husband, was no longer the right person to take vengeance on his murderer. On the use of <foreign lang="greek">οὐκέτι</foreign>, the opposite of <foreign lang="greek">ἤδη</foreign>, &lsquo;not <hi rend="italic">now</hi> as before, in former cases&rsquo;, see note on I 1. 7, <foreign lang="greek">ἤδη, οὔπω, οὐκέτι</foreign>. </p>
						<p>On Theodectes of Phaselis, see note on II 23. 3, and the reff. Also compare the topic of that section with this example from his Orestes, which in all probability is there also referred to. This passage of Aristotle is cited by Wagner, <hi rend="italic">Fragm. Trag. Graec.</hi> III 122, without comment, as the sole remaining specimen of Theodectes' Orestes. </p>
						<p>&lsquo;This may also be explained as the fallacy of omission; for the (person) by whom (the deed was done) is withdrawn&rsquo;. Had it been stated &lsquo;by whom&rsquo; the vengeance was inflicted, the <hi rend="italic">injustice</hi> of it would have been apparent. It is stated generally, the particular circumstances which falsify the statement in this case being omitted. <foreign lang="greek">παρὰ τὴν ἔλλειψιν</foreign> is explained in &sect; 9, <foreign lang="greek">τὴν ἔλλειψιν τοῦ πότε καὶ πῶς</foreign>, the omission of time and circumstances, which falls under the more general head of <foreign lang="greek">τὸ ἁπλῶς καὶ μὴ ἁπλῶς</foreign>, &sect; 10, an unqualified, instead of qualified statement. It occurs also in &sect; 7. </p>

						<p>&lsquo;Another topic (of fallacious reasoning) is exaggeration, <foreign lang="greek">δεινωσις</foreign>&rsquo;&mdash;especially the excitement of indignation contrasted with <foreign lang="greek">ἔλεος</foreign>, II 21. 10, III 19. 3&mdash;in construction or destruction (of a thesis or argument). <hi rend="italic">Haec est illa quae</hi> <foreign lang="greek">δείνωσις</foreign> <hi rend="italic">vocatur: rebus indignis asperis, invidiosis, addens vim oratio.</hi> Quint.

						<p>&lsquo;This means to amplify, heighten, intensify, exaggerate (a species of the general topic <foreign lang="greek">αὔξειν καὶ μειοῦν</foreign>, amplification and depreciation, the fourth of the <foreign lang="greek">κοινοὶ τόποι</foreign>. Introd. p. 129, comp. II 26. 1), the fact or act alleged (usually a crime), without any proof of its having been committed: for it makes it appear, either that it has not been done&rsquo; (read <foreign lang="greek">οὐ</foreign> for <foreign lang="greek">οὔτε</foreign>, with Bekker and Spengel), &lsquo;when the party accused (or inculpated) employs it; or that the accused is guilty when the accuser grows angry (works himself into a fit of virtuous indignation)&rsquo;. This might seem to confine the topic to accusation and defence in the forensic branch, and no doubt it is in this that it is most useful and most usual; and also this is its most appropriate sphere as a fallacious <hi rend="italic">argument:</hi> still as a species of one of the <foreign lang="greek">κοινοὶ τόποι</foreign> it must needs be applicable to the other two branches, and in fact in all invectives, and in epideictic oratory, it is essential. Its appropriate place in the speech is the <foreign lang="greek">ἐπίλογος</foreign> or peroration, III 19. 1, 3. </p>
						<p>&lsquo;Accordingly it is no (true) enthymeme, for the listener falsely concludes (assumes) the guilt or innocence (alleged) though neither of them has been proved&rsquo;. This is of course a purely rhetorical topic. </p>

						<p>&lsquo;Another fallacy is derived from the use of the &lsquo;sign&rsquo;: for this also leads to no real conclusion (<hi rend="italic">proves, demonstrates</hi>, nothing)&rsquo;. On the <hi rend="italic">sign</hi> and its logical character and value, see Introd. pp. 161&mdash;3, and the paraphrases of Rhet. I 2. 15&mdash;18, Ibid. pp. 163&mdash;5. </p>
						<p>In the Topics, fallacies from the sign are noticed as the form which fallacies of <hi rend="italic">consequence</hi> assume in Rhetoric. <foreign lang="greek">ἔν τε τοῖς ῥητορικοῖς αἱ κατὰ τὸ σημεῖον ἀποδείξεις ἐκ τῶν ἑπομένων εἰσίν</foreign>.

						<p>&lsquo;As for instance if one were to say, &ldquo;Lovers are of service to states; for it was the love of Harmodius and Aristogeiton that put down (put an end to) the tyranny of Hipparchus&rdquo;&rsquo;. This is a mere <hi rend="italic">apparent sign</hi> or possible indication of a connexion between love and the putting down of tyranny: there is no <hi rend="italic">necessary consequence;</hi> it is not a <foreign lang="greek">τεκμήριον</foreign>, a conclusive sign, or indication: no general rule of connexion can be established between them, from which we might infer&mdash;without fallacy&mdash; <pb n="312"/> that the one would always, or for the most part, follow the other. Herein lies the difference between the dialectical <hi rend="italic">consequence</hi> and the rhetorical <hi rend="italic">sign.</hi> The converse of this&mdash;from the governor's point of view&mdash;is argued by Pausanias in Plato's Symp. 182 C. <foreign lang="greek">Οὐ γὰρ, οἶμαι, συμφέρει τοῖς ἄρχουσι...φιλίας ἰσχυρὰς καὶ κοινωνίας</foreign> (<foreign lang="greek">ἐγγίνεσθαι</foreign>): <foreign lang="greek">ὃ δὴ μάλιστα φιλεῖ τά τε ἄλλα πάντα καὶ ὁ ἔρως ἐμποιεῖν. ἔργῳ δὲ τοῦτο ἔμαθον καὶ οἱ ἐνθάδε τύραννοι· ὅ γὰρ Ἀριστογείτονος ἔρως καὶ Ἁρμοδίου φιλία βέβαιος γενομένη κατέλυσεν αὐτῶν τὴν ἀρχήν</foreign>.

						<p>&lsquo;Or again, if one were to say, (it is a sign) that Dionysius (Dionysius, like Socrates and Coriscus, usually, in Aristotle, here represents anybody, men in general) is a thief, because he is a bad man: for this again is incapable of demonstration; because every bad man is not a thief, though every thief is a bad man&rsquo;. The consequence is not <hi rend="italic">convertible.</hi> <foreign lang="greek">Ὁ δὲ παρὰ τὸ ἑπόμενον ἔλεγχος διὰ τὸ οἴεσθαι ἀντιστρέφειν τὴν ἀκολούθησιν</foreign>, (the fallacy in this topic arises from the assumed convertibility of the consequence), de Soph.

					</div3>
					<div3 id="b2c24s6" type="section" n="6">
						<p>&lsquo;Another, the fallacy of <hi rend="italic">accident</hi>&rsquo;. This is not the same fallacy as that which has the same name in the Topics, the first of the fallacies <foreign lang="greek">ἔξω τῆς λέξεως</foreign>, de Soph. El. c. 5, 166 <hi rend="italic">b</hi> 28; &ldquo;Fallacies of accident are those that arise from the assumption that the same things are predicable alike of the thing itself (<foreign lang="greek">τὸ πρᾶγμα</foreign>, i.e. the logical subject, <foreign lang="greek">τὸ ὑποκείμενον</foreign>). For whereas the same subject has many accidents, it is by no means necessary that all that is predicable of the former should also be predicable of the latter.&rdquo; White is an accident, or predicable, of the subject, man: it is by no means true that all that can be predicated of man can also be predicated of white. The confusion of these, the substitution of one for the other, gives rise to the fallacy. The example is the following:&mdash;A Sophist argues that because Socrates is not Coriscus, and Coriscus is a man, Socrates is not a man. Man is the subject, and Socrates and Coriscus are both predicates, attributes, or accidents of man. And if we substitute &lsquo;name&rsquo; for &lsquo;man&rsquo; in the proposition &lsquo;Coriscus is a man&rsquo;, the argument vanishes. But both the examples here are instances of accident for <hi rend="italic">cause</hi>, and not for subject, which is no doubt a more suitable application of it for rhetorical purposes. </p>
						<p>The first example is taken from Polycrates' encomium on mice, quoted above without the name, &sect; 2. One of his topics in praise of them was &ldquo;the aid they lent by gnawing through the bow-strings.&rdquo; Something similar to this is narrated by Herodotus, II 141 (Schrader), but the circumstances do not quite tally. Sennacherib king of the Arabians and <pb n="313"/> Assyria invaded Egypt with a great host, when Sethos the priest was king. The god appeared to him in a dream with promises of succour against the invaders. &ldquo;A flood of field-mice poured over the enemy by night, which devoured their quivers and bows, and besides, the handles of their shields, so that on the following day, flying without arms, many of them fell,&rdquo; &amp;c. At all events, wherever the incident was taken from, Polycrates meant to praise the mice for some <hi rend="italic">service</hi> they had rendered by gnawing the bow-strings: now this service was a mere accident: their intention was, not to do service, but only to satisfy their appetite (Victorius). Polycrates' fallacy therefore consists in assigning as a <hi rend="italic">vera causa</hi> what was only accidental. I do not see how this can be construed as a confusion of <hi rend="italic">subject</hi> and accident. And so Victorius in his explanation; &ldquo;quia quod casu evenit tamquam propter se fuisset sumitur<note anchored="yes">This seems to be the true interpretation; Aristotle has here left it open by not defining the topic. But if this absence of defin, be understood as a tacit reference to the de Soph. El., and we desire to bring the examples here into conformity with the explanation of the topic there, we may understand <foreign lang="greek">τὸ πρᾶγμα</foreign> in that passage, not as the logical subject, but as &lsquo;thing&rsquo; in general, and say that the fallacy of the examples in the Rhetoric lies in the substitution of a mere accident for the <hi rend="italic">thing</hi> in question, i.e. the real thing, the reality; as in that of the mice, the accidental <hi rend="italic">service</hi>, for the real <hi rend="italic">appetite:</hi> and in Achilles' case, the accidental neglect to invite, for the real disrespect that it implied.</note>.&rdquo; </p>
						<p>Of the declamations of Polycrates, who has been already twice mentioned or referred to, the most celebrated were the <foreign lang="greek">ἀπολογία Βουσίριδος</foreign>, a paradoxical defence of Busiris a mythical king of Egypt, proverbial for inhumanity, <hi rend="italic">illaudatus Busiris</hi>, Virg.

						<p>&lsquo;Or if one were to say that an invitation to dinner is the highest possible honour; because it was the want of an invitation which excited Achilles' wrath against the Achaeans at Tenedos: his anger was really excited by the disrespect, the non-invitation (the form or mode of its manifestation) was a mere accident of it&rsquo;. <foreign lang="greek">ἐπὶ τοῦ</foreign> &lsquo;on the occasion, in the case of&rsquo;. This is a fallacious inference (drawn either by Arist. himself, or, more likely, by some declaimer) from an incident in a play of Sophocles, the subject of which was this (Wagner, <hi rend="italic">Fr. Trag. Gr.</hi>, Soph., <foreign lang="greek">Ἀχαιῶν Σύλλογος</foreign>, Vol. II. p. 230, from Welcker):&mdash;The Greeks on their way to Troy had put in at the island of Tenedos to hold a council as to the best way of attacking the city. Achilles would not attend at the meeting, having taken offence at the neglect, and presumed slight or contempt, of Agamemnon in not inviting him, either not at all, or after the rest, to an entertainment. There are two extant titles of plays by Sophocles, the <foreign lang="greek">Ἀχαιῶν σύλλογος</foreign>, and <foreign lang="greek">Ἀχαιῶν σύνδειπνον</foreign>, or <foreign lang="greek">σύνδειπνοι</foreign>, Plutarch, de discr. adul. et amici, 74 A, Vol. I. p. 280, ed.

						<p>&lsquo;Another from consequence&rsquo;, i. e. from the unduly assumed reciprocal convertibility of antecedent and consequent: just as in the &lsquo;sign&rsquo; (q. v.), between which and this there is no real difference. As we saw in &sect; 5, in the de Soph. El. the sign is spoken of as the rhetorical variety of the general topic of <hi rend="italic">consequence:</hi> and they ought not to be divided here. </p>
						<p>&lsquo;As in the Alexander&rsquo;, i. e. Paris; a declamation of some unknown author, already referred to, c. 23 &sect;&sect; 5, 8, 12; (it is argued) &lsquo;that he is high-minded, because he scorned the society of many&rsquo; (<hi rend="italic">quaere</hi> <foreign lang="greek">τῶν πολλῶν</foreign> &lsquo;of the vulgar&rsquo;) &lsquo;and dwelt alone in Ida&rsquo;: (the inference being that) &lsquo;because such is the disposition of the high-minded, therefore he might be supposed to be high-minded.&rsquo; This is a fallacy, or logical flaw, as Schrader puts it, &ldquo;quia universalem affirmantem convertit simpliciter, et <pb n="315"/> quia in secunda figura concludit affirmative.&rdquo; Or rather, as this is an illicit consequence, because here antecedent and consequent are not reciprocally convertible: it does not follow, even supposing that all highminded men dwell apart from others, that all lonely-dwellers are highminded men: and to say that so and so, anybody whatsoever, is highminded for that reason and that alone, is as much as to say that the rule is universal. </p>
						<p>&lsquo;And again (to argue) that so and so is a dandy and roams at night, and therefore a rake, because such are the habits of rakes&rsquo;. This, as before, is to say that because (supposing it to be so) all adulterers are smartly dressed and walk at night, therefore all smart dressers and night-walkers are adulterers. This appears also as an example of the sign, the rhetorical form of the topic <foreign lang="greek">τὸ ἑπόμενον</foreign>, de Soph. El. c. 5, 167 <hi rend="italic">b</hi> 9, <foreign lang="greek">βουλόμενοι γὰρ δεῖξαι ὅτι μοιχός, τὸ ἑπόμενον ἔλαβον, ὅτι καλλωπιστὴς ἢ ὅτι νύκτωρ ὁρᾶται πλανώμενος</foreign>.

						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">καλλωπιστής</lemma>] Plato Sympos. 174 A. Socrates (going out to dinner) <foreign lang="greek">ταῦτα δὴ ἐκαλλωπισάμην, ἵνα καλὸς παρὰ καλὸν ἴω</foreign>. </p>
						<p>&lsquo;And another (argument), similar to these (for exalting the condition of poverty and exile), is that beggars sing and dance in the temples, and that exiles are allowed to live where they please&rsquo;: because, these things (enjoyments) being the ordinary accidents or concomitants of apparent happiness, those who have them may also be supposed to be happy&rsquo;. Here again there is an illicit conversion of antecedent and consequent: if singing and dancing, or living where one pleased, were <hi rend="italic">coextensive</hi> with happiness, the inference would be true and the two convertible. As it is, it does not follow that, because these are <hi rend="italic">indications</hi> of happiness, or often accompany (follow) it, all men that sing and dance, or can live where they please, are necessarily happy. This is taken from one of those paradoxical encomiums of poverty and exile to which Isocrates refers, Helen. &sect; 8, <foreign lang="greek">ἤδη τινές...τολμῶσι γράφειν, ὡς ἔστιν ὁ τῶν πτωχευόντων καὶ φευγόντων βίος ζηλωτότερος ἢ τῶν ἄλλων ἀνθρώπων</foreign>; such as Alcidamas' <foreign lang="greek">πενίας ἐγκώμιον</foreign> cited above from Menander on &sect; 6.

						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">διαφέρει δὲ τῷ πῶς· διό κ.τ.λ.</lemma>] &lsquo;But there is a difference in their manner of doing these; and therefore this topic falls under the head of <hi rend="italic">omission</hi>, <pb n="316"/> as well as (<foreign lang="greek">καί</foreign>) that of <foreign lang="greek">τὸ ἑπόμενον</foreign>&rsquo;. Beggars and exiles do what appear to be the same things as the wealthy and prosperous, they dance and sing in the temples and sacred precincts, and change their place of residence at their pleasure: but there is a difference in the mode and motive of doing these things, <hi rend="italic">which is omitted;</hi> and the omission when supplied explains the fallacy. The beggars dance and sing in the temples to amuse the visitors and obtain an alms; the wealthy and prosperous out of wantonness or exultation, to shew that they have the liberty of doing what is forbidden to humbler people (so Victorius, and Schrader who borrows his note: these may however be mere <hi rend="italic">signs of happiness</hi> in the <foreign lang="greek">εὐδαίμονες</foreign>). And again, the exiles <hi rend="italic">are obliged</hi> to live abroad, and would gladly be at home again; the wealthy and prosperous travel for change of scene, to satisfy their curiosity, or (like Herodotus and Plato) their desire of knowledge. The <foreign lang="greek">ἔλλειψις</foreign> is here of <foreign lang="greek">τὸ πῶς</foreign>, as in &sect; 3, ult. of <foreign lang="greek">ὑπὸ τίνος</foreign>, and in &sect; 9, of <foreign lang="greek">πότε</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">πῶς</foreign>, which in each case may be applied to explain the fallacy. </p>

						<p>The fallacy here illustrated is the familiar <hi rend="italic">post hoc ergo propter hoc;</hi> the assumption of a mere chronological sequence as a true cause: to mistake a mere accidental connexion of the order of time, for one of cause and effect. It is the rhetorical application, and only one variety, of the wider and more general topic of the dialectical treatise (de Soph.

						<p>&lsquo;Another from the substitution of what is no cause for (the true) cause; for instance (this substitution takes place) by reason of the occurrence of something contemporaneously or subsequently (to that which is presumed to account for it): for it is assumed that what merely follows (in time) is the effect of a cause, and especially by politicians; as Demades, for instance, pronounced Demosthenes' policy to be the cause of all their calamities; because it was <hi rend="italic">after</hi> it that the war (with Philip, and the defeat of Chaeronea) occurred&rsquo;.

						<p>&lsquo;Another from the omission of <hi rend="italic">when</hi> and <hi rend="italic">how</hi>&rsquo;; a particular case, like those of &sect; 3, and &sect; 7, of the following topic <foreign lang="greek">παρὰ τὸ ἁπλῶς καὶ μὴ ἁπλῶς</foreign>; <hi rend="italic">a dicto secundum quid ad dictum simpliciter;</hi> the omission of particulars in the way of exceptions to a general statement, as time, place, manner, circumstances. &lsquo;For example, that Paris had a right to take Helen; for the choice was given her by her father (Tyndareus, the <hi rend="italic">choice</hi> viz. of one of the suitors, whichever she preferred)&rsquo;. Eur. Iph. Aul. 66, <foreign lang="greek">ἐπεὶ δ’  ἐπιστώθησαν, εὖ δέ πως γέρων ὑπῆλθεν αὐτοὺς Τυνδάρεως πυκνῇ φρενί, δίδως̓ ἑλέσθαι θυγατρὶ μνηστήρων ἕνα</foreign> (Victorius). The whole story of &lsquo;Helen's choice&rsquo;, and the sequel, is told by Agamemnon, Iph. Aul. 49 seq., in his speech at the opening of the play, which serves for the prologue. </p>
						<p>But this is a fallacy; &lsquo;for (the choice was granted) not it may be supposed (<foreign lang="greek">ἴσως</foreign>) for ever, but only for the first time: for in fact the father's authority only extends so far&rsquo;. Helen, acting upon her father's permission, chose Menelaus; <foreign lang="greek">ἡ δ’  εἵλεθ̓ ὥς γε μήποτ̓ ὤφελεν λαβεῖν Μενέλαον</foreign>, Iph. A. 70; and here, at this <hi rend="italic">first</hi> choice, her father's authority and her own right to choose ended. The fallacy therefore consists in the &lsquo;omission&rsquo; of the particular time, <foreign lang="greek">τοῦ πότε</foreign>; she <hi rend="italic">generalized</hi> the time of choice from the particular time to all time; and therefore Paris was <hi rend="italic">not</hi> &lsquo;justified&rsquo; in taking her. </p>
						<p>&lsquo;Or again, if one were to say, that to strike a free man is an act of <foreign lang="greek">ὕβρις</foreign> (wanton outrage, liable to a <foreign lang="greek">γραφή</foreign>, a public prosecution): for it is not so in every case (<foreign lang="greek">πάντως</foreign> = <foreign lang="greek">ἁπλῶς</foreign>), but only (<foreign lang="greek">κατά τι</foreign>) when the striker is the aggressor&rsquo;. This of course makes all the difference in the nature and legal construction of the offence.

						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ἐν τοῖς ἐριστικοῖς</lemma>]. See note on I 11. 15, where the meaning of this as a technical term is illustrated from the de Soph. El. <foreign lang="greek">τὰ ἐριστικά</foreign> here designates a book or treatise; the fallacious, sophistical reasoning exposed in the ninth book of the Topics; just as <foreign lang="greek">τὰ διαλεκτικά</foreign> stands for the dialectical treatise, including (as below), or not including, the appendage on Fallacies. The subject of the de Soph. El. is described as <foreign lang="greek">περὶ τῶν ἀγωνιστικῶν καὶ ἐριστικῶν</foreign>, 165 <hi rend="italic">b</hi> 10. <foreign lang="greek">ἐριστική</foreign> there, c. 2, is first distinguished from the three other kinds of &lsquo;discussion&rsquo;, <foreign lang="greek">διδασκαλική</foreign> (science), <foreign lang="greek">διαλεκτική</foreign>, and <foreign lang="greek">πειραστική</foreign>, a branch of the latter; and the <foreign lang="greek">ἐριστικοί</foreign> are defined, <foreign lang="greek">οἱ ἐκ τῶν φαινομένων ἐνδόξων μὴ ὄντων δὲ συλλογιστικοὶ ἢ φαινόμενοι συλλογιστικοί</foreign>, which would include the <foreign lang="greek">σοφιστικοί</foreign>. Elsewhere the two are distinguished; both are <foreign lang="greek">οἱ πάντως νικᾷν</foreign> (victory at any price) <foreign lang="greek">προαιρούμενοι</foreign>, 171 <hi rend="italic">b</hi> 24; but <foreign lang="greek">οἱ τῆς νίκης αὐτῆς χάριν τοιοῦτοι ἐριστικοὶ καὶ φιλέριδες δοκοῦσιν εἶναι, οἱ δὲ δόξης χάριν τῆς εἰς χρηματισμὸν σοφιστικοί</foreign>: the one dispute out of mere pugnacity and contentious habit, the others add to this a desire of gaining a reputation which may be turned to profitable account. </p>
						<p>&lsquo;Further, as in the eristic branch of dialectics, from the substitution of something as universally or absolutely for that which is so not universally, but only partially, or in <hi rend="italic">particular</hi> cases, an apparent (fallacious) syllogism (i. e. enthymeme, see on I 1. 11) is elicited. As in dialectics for instance, the argument &ldquo;that the non-existent <hi rend="italic">is</hi> (has existence), because non-being <hi rend="italic">is</hi> non-being&rdquo;&rsquo;. (<hi rend="italic">Is</hi>, <foreign lang="greek">ἐστί</foreign>, has two different senses, absolute and relative, or absolute and particular: the Sophist, in the second case, <hi rend="italic">intends</hi> it to be understood in its most general signification <foreign lang="greek">ἁπλῶς</foreign>, of actual existence: it is in fact a mere copula connecting the one <foreign lang="greek">μὴ ὄν</foreign> with the other, and merely states the identity of those two <hi rend="italic">expressions</hi>, which is no doubt a very <hi rend="italic">partial statement</hi> indeed: it is true, but nothing to the purpose of the argument. Comp. de Soph. El. c. 25, 180 <hi rend="italic">a</hi> 33, 4.) &lsquo;Or again that the unknown is an object of knowledge, because the unknown may be known&mdash;that it is unknown&rsquo;. (Here of course the particular that is left out of the account is the <foreign lang="greek">ὅτι ἄγνωστον</foreign>; whereby the absolute or universal, &lsquo;the unknown is knowable&rsquo;, is substituted for the partial or particular statement, that what is knowable is only that it cannot be known.) &lsquo;So also in Rhetoric a seeming inference may be drawn from the absolute to merely partial probability&rsquo;. This topic is illustrated in Plat. Euthyd. 293 C seq. See Grote's <hi rend="italic">Plato</hi>, I 546, 7, and 549; [also Grote's <hi rend="italic">Aristotle</hi> I 182, note]. </p>
						<p>The construction of this last sentence which had been obscured by wrong punctuation in Bekker's 4to and first 8vo ed., has in the second been made intelligible and consecutive by removing the full stops at <foreign lang="greek">μὴ ὄν</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">ὅτι ἄγνωστον</foreign>, and changing all the colons into commas. The <pb n="319"/> correlative of <foreign lang="greek">ὥσπερ ἐν τοῖς ἐριστικοῖς</foreign> is of course <foreign lang="greek">οὕτω καὶ ἐν τοῖς ῥητορικοῖς</foreign>: and in the intervening sentence <foreign lang="greek">οἷον ἐν μὲν τοῖς διαλεκτικοῖς</foreign>, the <foreign lang="greek">μέν</foreign> has also reference to an intended <foreign lang="greek">δέ</foreign>, to be inserted when Rhetoric comes to be contrasted with Dialectics, which however is never expressed and the <foreign lang="greek">μέν</foreign> left <hi rend="italic">pendens.</hi> </p>
						<p>The topic is first defined in general terms, as it appears in the dialectical treatise, and illustrated by two examples of its <hi rend="italic">dialectical</hi> use: and then exhibited in its <hi rend="italic">special</hi> application to Rhetoric, the paralogism of absolute and particular probability. The first, as in the dialectical examples, is confounded with, or substituted for, the second. </p>
						<p>&lsquo;This (particular probability, <foreign lang="greek">τὶ εἰκός</foreign>,) is not universally (true or applicable), as indeed Agathon says: Perchance just this may be called likely, that many unlikely things befall mortals&rsquo;, Agathon, Fragm. Inc. 5. Wagner, <hi rend="italic">Fragm. Trag. Gr.</hi> III 78. Of Agathon, see M&uuml;ller, <hi rend="italic">Hist. Gr. Lit.</hi> ch. XXVI. &sect; 3. <hi rend="italic">Camb. Journ. of Cl. and Sacred Phil.</hi> No. IX, Vol. III. p. 257. Spengel, <hi rend="italic">Artium Scriptores</hi>, p. 91, merely quotes four fragments from Aristotle. The extant fragments are collected by Wagner, u. s., on p. 73 seq. His style is criticized in Aristoph. Thesm. 55 seq. and imitated or caricatured 101 seq. A specimen of his Rhetoric is given by Plato, Symp. 194 E seq. </p>
						<p>This &lsquo;probable improbable&rsquo; is illustrated in Poet. XVIII 17, 18, from tragedy, by the cunning man cheated, and by the defeat of the brave. <foreign lang="greek">ἔστι δὲ τοῦτο εἰκός, ὥσπερ Ἀγάθων λέγει· εἰκὸς γὰρ γίνεσθαι πολλὰ καὶ παρὰ τὸ εἶκος</foreign>. Comp. XXV 29. On this fallacy the &lsquo;solution&rsquo; in Rhet. ad Alex. 36 (37) &sect; 29, is based. Dion. Ep. I ad Amm. c. 8, <foreign lang="greek">τὸ κακουργότατον τῶν ἐπιχειρημάτων...ὅτι καὶ τὸ μὴ εἰκὸς γίνεταί ποτε εἰκός</foreign>. </p>
						<p>&lsquo;For what is contrary to the probable does come to pass, and therefore what is <hi rend="italic">contrary</hi> to probability is also probable (<foreign lang="greek">καί</foreign>, besides what is <hi rend="italic">directly</hi> probable). And if so, the improbable will be probable. Yes, but not absolutely (the answer); but as indeed in the case of Dialectics (in the dialectical form of the fallacy), it is the omission of the circumstances (<foreign lang="greek">κατὰ τί</foreign>, in what respect,) and relation and mode that causes the cheat, so here also (in Rhetoric) (the fallacy arises) from the probability assumed not being absolute probability (or probability in general) but <pb n="320"/> some particular, special probability&rsquo;. That which is only probable in particular cases, as in particular times, places, relations, and circumstances in general, is fraudulently represented as probable absolutely, <hi rend="italic">without</hi> any such conditions or qualifications. </p>
						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">συκοφαντία</lemma>, in this sense of a logical cheat or deception, transferred from its ordinary meaning, of a false, calumnious information or charge, is not to be found in any of the Lexicons. </p>

						<p>&lsquo;Of (the application of) this topic the (whole) &ldquo;art&rdquo; of Corax is composed.&rsquo; &lsquo;This topic&rsquo;, as Ar. afterwards implies, is the topic of <foreign lang="greek">τὸ εἰκός</foreign> in general, and not confined to the fallacious use of it. In the former of the two alternatives of the example from Corax's Art the argument is fair enough; the feeble man may fairly plead that it was not likely that he should be guilty of an assault upon one much stronger than himself. Of course this does not <hi rend="italic">prove</hi> the point, but it would have a considerable effect in <hi rend="italic">persuading</hi> the judges of the accused's innocence, &lsquo;For whether he (the accused) be not liable to the charge, as for instance if (repeat <foreign lang="greek">ἄν</foreign> from the preceding) a weak man were to be tried for an assault, (he defends himself upon the ground that, <hi rend="italic">lit.</hi> &lsquo;it is because,&rsquo;) it is improbable: or if he be liable (under the same circumstances), as for instance if he be a strong man (he argues&mdash;the omission explained as before) that it <hi rend="italic">is</hi> improbable because it was likely to <hi rend="italic">seem</hi> probable&rsquo; (and therefore knowing that he would be exposed to the suspicion he was less likely to bring upon himself an almost certain punishment). And in like manner in all other cases: for the accused must be either liable or not liable to the charge: now it is true that both <hi rend="italic">seem</hi> probable, but the one is really so, the other not probable in the abstract (<foreign lang="greek">ἁπλῶς</foreign> <hi rend="italic">simpliciter</hi>), but in the way that has been already stated&rsquo;, i. e. under the conditions and circumstances before mentioned. </p>

Journ. of Cl. and Sacred Phil.</hi> No. VII, Vol. III. p. 40 seq., Westerm. <hi rend="italic">Gesch. der Beredt.</hi> &sect; 27, pp. 35&mdash;7, M&uuml;ller, <hi rend="italic">Hist. Gr. Lit.</hi> XXXII 3 [and Blass, <hi rend="italic">die Attische Beredsamkeit</hi> I. pp. 19, 20]. </p>
						<p>The assault case and its alternatives was evidently one of the stock instances of the rhetorical books. It has been already referred to in I 12. 5, and re-appears in Plat. Phaedr. 223 B, as an extract from Tisias' art. Again in Rhet. ad Alex. 36 (37) &sect; 6. </p>
						<p>The topic <foreign lang="greek">τὸ εἰκός</foreign> which formed the staple of the art of Corax, and was treated in that of Tisias, Plato, l. c., continued in fashion with the <pb n="321"/> early rhetoricians of the Sophistical school, as we may see by the constant notices of it in Plato. Somewhat later it was taken up by Antiphon, a disciple of this school, and appears in his three surviving school exercises, or <foreign lang="greek">μελέται</foreign>, the Tetralogies. See also de caed. Herod. &sect; 63. On the <foreign lang="greek">τόπος</foreign> of the first of these, see M&uuml;ller, <hi rend="italic">Hist. Gr. L.</hi> XXXIII &sect; 2. It is to be found also in the Rhet. ad Alex.; and of course in the Orators: and it crept into the Tragedies of Agathon. An amusing instance of the alternative application of the argument is the story of the encounter between Corax and his pupil Tisias in the attempt of the former to recover the fees due for his instruction, which Tisias had withheld. Related at length in <hi rend="italic">Camb. Journ. of Cl. and Sacred Phil.</hi> No. VII, Vol. III p. 34. It is likewise told of Protagoras and his wealthy pupil Euathlus. </p>
						<p>&lsquo;And this is (the meaning of) &ldquo;making the worse appear the better argument:&rdquo;&rsquo; (that is, giving the superior to the inferior, the less <hi rend="italic">probable</hi>) argument, making it prevail over that which is <hi rend="italic">really</hi> superior, and more probable: which is identical with the second, the fallacious alternative of Corax's <foreign lang="greek">τόπος</foreign>. Cic., Brut. VIII 30, extends this profession to all the Sophists. <hi rend="italic">Tum Leontinus Gorgias...Protagoras Abderites ... aliique multi temporibus eisdem docere se profitebantur, arrogantibus sane verbis, quemadmodum causa inferior</hi> (<hi rend="italic">ita enim loquebantur</hi>) <hi rend="italic">dicendo fieri superior posset.</hi> See the dialogue between the <foreign lang="greek">δίκαιος</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">ἄδικος λόγος</foreign>, Arist. Nub. 889&mdash;1104. <foreign lang="greek">τὼ λόγωτὸν κρείττον’ , ὅστις ἐστί, καὶ τὸν ἥττονα, 882. τίς ὤν; λόγος. ἥττων γ̓ ὤν. ἀλλά σε νικῶ, τὸν ἐμοῦ κρείττω φάσκοντ̓ εἶναι</foreign>, 893: and he keeps his word. The fair argument is at last forced to own his defeat, and acknowledge the superiority of his unfair competitor. This was one of the articles of charge of Meletus and his coadjutors against Socrates, Plat. Apol. 19 B. Socrates is there made to refer to Aristophanes as its original author. </p>
						<p>&lsquo;And hence it was that men were justified in taking offence (in the displeasure, indignation, they felt) at Protagoras' <hi rend="italic">profession:</hi> for it (the mode of arguing that it implies) is false, and not real (true, sound, genuine) but only apparent; and no true art (proceeding by, <hi rend="italic">lit.</hi> &lsquo;included in,&rsquo; no rule of genuine art), but mere rhetoric and quibbling. And so much for enthymemes, real and apparent&rsquo;. <foreign lang="greek">αὐτὸ μὲν οὖν τοῦτό ἐστιν, ἔφη</foreign> (<foreign lang="greek">ὁ Πρωταγόρας</foreign>), <foreign lang="greek">ὦ Σώκρατες, τὸ ἐπάγγελμα ὃ ἐπαγγέλλομαι</foreign>. Plat. Protag. 319 A. </p>
						<p>This distinction of <foreign lang="greek">ἀληθής</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">φαινόμενος, εἶναι</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">φαίνεσθαι</foreign>, reality and appearance, the true, genuine, substantial, and the sham, false <pb n="322"/> semblance, is traced in its various applications at the opening of the de Soph. El. The latter is the especial characteristic of the Sophists and their professions and practice, 165 <hi rend="italic">a</hi> 21, c. 11, 171 <hi rend="italic">b</hi> 27&mdash;34, and elsewhere. It constantly re-appears in Aristotle's writings. </p>
						<p>The imputation here cast on Protagoras' profession is rather that of logical than of moral obliquity and error, though no doubt the latter may also be implied. </p>
						<p>I have already referred to the strong expression of Diogenes, Ep. ad Amm. c. 8, on the use of this topic, above, note on &sect; 10. </p>

					<p>The account of the genuine and spurious enthymemes or rhetorical inferences in cc. XXIII, XXIV, is followed by a chapter upon <foreign lang="greek">λύσις</foreign>, the various modes of refuting an adversary's argument; the same order being observed as in the corresponding Dialectics (<foreign lang="greek">ἀντίστροφος ἡ ῥητορικὴ τῇ διαλεκτικῇ</foreign>), where we have first (in the eight books of the Topics) the art of logical, systematic, argumentation, laid down and analysed; which is supplemented in an Appendix, Top. IX, or de Soph. El., by an account, (in the first fifteen chapters) of sophistical fallacies and paradoxes, and (from c. 16 to 33) the various modes of &lsquo;solving&rsquo; or refuting them [Grote's <hi rend="italic">Aristotle</hi>, chap. X]. The principal difference between them is that the dialectical <foreign lang="greek">λύσις</foreign> deals only with the refutation of <hi rend="italic">fallacious</hi> arguments, the rhetorical with that of rhetorical inferences or enthymemes in general. The same subject is treated again, more briefly, in III 17, under the head of <foreign lang="greek">πίστεις</foreign>, the third &lsquo;division of the speech&rsquo;, including the establishment of your own case and the refutation of your opponent's: and in the Rhet. ad Alex. 36 (37), under that of accusation and defence. </p>
					<p>On <foreign lang="greek">λύσις</foreign>, solution, or refutation in general, and its divisions, according to Aristotle, see Poste, <hi rend="italic">Transl. of Posterior Analytics</hi>, Introd. pp. 28&mdash;30.

In the Topics there is no direct and detailed explanation of <foreign lang="greek">λύσις</foreign> or <foreign lang="greek">ἔνστασις λύσις</foreign> is <hi rend="italic">exemplified</hi> in de Soph. El.&mdash;though that book is twice referred to, II 25. 3, 26. 4, as containing an account of the latter of the two. This apparent contradiction will be considered in the note on the former of the two passages. </p>
					<div3 id="b2c25s1" type="section" n="1">
						<p>&lsquo;The next thing we have to treat of, after what has already been said (c. XXIII. XXIV), is <foreign lang="greek">λύσις</foreign>, the modes of refuting an opponent's arguments&rsquo;. On the meaning and derivation of <foreign lang="greek">λύσις</foreign>, see Introd. p. 267, note. <pb n="323"/> </p>
						<p>&lsquo;This solution or refutation may be effected either by a countersyllogism (which concludes the negative of the opponent's thesis or conclusion, the regular <foreign lang="greek">ἔλεγχος</foreign>) or by advancing a (contradictory) <hi rend="italic">instance</hi>, or objection (to one of the premisses proving or indicating a false statement)&rsquo;. The <hi rend="italic">conclusion</hi> must be refuted by a counter-<hi rend="italic">syllogism.</hi> Comp. on these two, c. 26. 3, 4. </p>

						<p>&lsquo;Now these counter-syllogisms may plainly be constructed out of the same topics: for syllogisms&rsquo; (i. e. not all syllogisms, not the scientific and demonstrative, but dialectical syllogisms, and rhetorical enthymemes: note on I 1. 11) &lsquo;are derived from probable materials, and mere (variable) <hi rend="italic">opinions</hi>&rsquo; (what is generally <hi rend="italic">thought</hi>, probabilities;&mdash; truth, the conclusions of science, is constant: and scientific demonstration, the object of which is <foreign lang="greek">ἀλήθεια</foreign>, does <hi rend="italic">not</hi> admit, like Dialectics and Rhetoric, of opposite conclusions, of arguments on <hi rend="italic">either</hi> side of a question), &lsquo;are often contrary to one another, (and therefore can be converted into <hi rend="italic">opposite</hi> enthymemes)&rsquo;. </p>

					<div3 id="b2c25s3" type="section" n="3">
						<p>&lsquo;Objections (contradictory instances) are brought (against opposing enthymemes) in four ways, as also in the Topics&rsquo;. Schrader had long ago observed that the words <foreign lang="greek">ἐν τοῖς τοπικοῖς</foreign> are not a reference to the special treatise of that name, but express the art, or the practice of it, in general; and this explanation he had already applied to other passages, as II 23. 9, <foreign lang="greek">ἐν τοῖς τοπικοῖς</foreign> and 24. 10, <foreign lang="greek">ἐν τοῖς ἐριστικοῖς</foreign>; unnecessarily in those two, as we have seen. </p>
						<p>Brandis will not allow that &lsquo;the Topics&rsquo; can ever be applied to Dialectics in general, but thinks that it must be confined to the particular book in which Dialectics are treated <hi rend="italic">as Topics</hi> (wherein Vahlen agrees with him). He admits that although the fourfold division of <foreign lang="greek">ἐνστάσεις</foreign>, <hi rend="italic">as here given</hi>, is not found in the Topics, as we now have them, (there is a <hi rend="italic">different</hi> division into four,) yet the proper place for them is indicated in Bk. <foreign lang="greek">Θ</foreign> c. 10; also, that there are plenty of <hi rend="italic">examples</hi> of these four <foreign lang="greek">ἐνστάσεις</foreign> in the Topics; and also that they are found (substantially, not by name and description,) in the Analytics. Nevertheless, he hesitates to suppose that there can be a direct reference to the Topics here and suggests the possibility of an alteration of Bk. <foreign lang="greek">Θ</foreign> subsequent to the composition of the Rhetoric, or of an omission of something in our present text. Tract in Schneidewin's <hi rend="italic">Philologus</hi> IV. i, p. 23. </p>
						<p>To this Vahlen very fairly replies, <hi rend="italic">zur krit. der Ar. Schrift.</hi> II 25, 1402 <hi rend="italic">a</hi> 30, (<hi rend="italic">Trans. Vien. Acad.</hi> Oct. 1861, p. 140), that Aristotle &ldquo;has so often exemplified the application of these four kinds of <foreign lang="greek">ἐνστάσεις</foreign> in the eighth book of the Topics&mdash;see especially c. 2, 157 <hi rend="italic">a</hi> 34, and <hi rend="italic">b</hi> 1, ff.&mdash; and elsewhere throughout the treatise&mdash;as in the Topics of <foreign lang="greek">πρός τι</foreign> (<foreign lang="greek">Ζ</foreign> 8, 9), <foreign lang="greek">γένος</foreign> (<foreign lang="greek">Δ</foreign>), <foreign lang="greek">ἴδιον</foreign> (E),&mdash;that he might very well refer to that work <pb n="324"/> here in the Rhetoric for the application of them to the use of that art.&rdquo; &ldquo;The words <foreign lang="greek">καθάπερ καὶ ἐν τοῖς τοπικοῖς</foreign> need not be referred to more than the <foreign lang="greek">φέρονται ἐνστάσεις</foreign> (the bringing or <hi rend="italic">application</hi> of objections), and the expression here is no less correct than in 1403 <hi rend="italic">a</hi> 31.&rdquo; (26. 4): and consequently (he says) Brandis' two suggestions are superfluous. The reference to the Topics in Rhet. I 2. 9 is a case exactly parallel to this. It is not made to any particular passage, but what is stated may be gathered or inferred from the contents of that work. Compare note ad loc., and see Introd. p. 154, note 1. </p>
						<p>On <foreign lang="greek">ἐνστάσεις</foreign> and its four kinds, Introd. pp. 269&mdash;271; where the examples that follow, &sect;&sect; 4&mdash;7, are also explained. We learn from the chapter of the Analytics that &lsquo;objections&rsquo;, directed against the premisses of a syllogism (or enthymeme), may be either universal or particular: and that the syllogisms into which they are thrown are either in the first or third figure. </p>
						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ἐξ ἑαυτοῦ</lemma>] which in the next sentence becomes <foreign lang="greek">ἀφ’  ἑαυτοῦ</foreign>, is, as Schrader puts it, &ldquo;Cum ex eo quod antecedenti enthymematis nobis oppositi, eiusdemque vel subiecto vel praedicato inest, contrarium argumentum exsculpitur, eoque id quod obiectum est confutatur.&rdquo; An argument derived &lsquo;from itself&rsquo; must mean &lsquo;from the opponent's enthymeme itself&rsquo;, and so retorted on him. </p>

						<p>&lsquo;Supposing for instance your adversary's major premisses were, &ldquo;all love is good&rdquo;, the objection may be opposed in two ways: either (universally) by saying that all want or defect&rsquo; (one of Plato's notions of love, Philebus, comp. Rhet. I 11. 11, 12) &lsquo;is bad: or particularly, that, if that were the case, the &lsquo;Caunian love&rsquo; would never have passed into a proverb (this is a <hi rend="italic">particular</hi> instance; <hi rend="italic">some</hi> love), if there had been no form of love bad at all.&rsquo; </p>
						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">Καύνιος ἔρως</lemma>] The reading of all MSS but Ac is <foreign lang="greek">κάλλιστος ἢ κάκιστος ἔρως</foreign>. Who could have divined from this, without the aid of that MS, that <foreign lang="greek">Καύνιος</foreign> was what the author had written? asks Spengel, <hi rend="italic">Trans. Bav.

						<p>The saying is proverbial for &lsquo;an illicit, or unfortunate (fatally ending) passion&rsquo;&mdash;in either case <foreign lang="greek">πονηρός</foreign>&mdash;such as that of Byblis for her brother Caunus; which was <foreign lang="greek">πονηρός</foreign> in both its senses.

						<p>&lsquo;The case of a <hi rend="italic">contrary</hi> instance or objection is exemplified by the following, suppose the opponent's enthymeme is this&rsquo; (i. e. has for its major premiss, is constructed upon the principle that, derives its conclusion from this), &lsquo;that all good men&rsquo; (<foreign lang="greek">ὁ ἀγαθός</foreign>, the definite article marks the <hi rend="italic">class:</hi> note on I 7. 13, comp.

But the latter is known not to be universally true; to some of their friends bad men do harm, to others not: it is <hi rend="italic">not</hi> necessary therefore that good men should always help all their friends; they may be good without that. So Victorius. Comp. Top. B 9, 114 <hi rend="italic">b</hi> 6 seq. where two other examples are given: <foreign lang="greek">σκοπεῖν δὲ...καὶ ἐπὶ τοῦ ἐναντίου τὸ ἐναντίον, οἷον ὅτι τὸ ἀγαθὸν οὐκ ἐξ ἀνάγκης ἡδύ· οὐδὲ γὰρ τὸ κακὸν λυπηρόν· ἢ εἰ τοῦτο, κἀκεῖνο. καὶ εἰ ἡ δικαιοσύνη ἐπιστήμη, καὶ ἡ ἀδικία ἄγνοια. καὶ εἰ τὸ δικαίως ἐπιστημονικῶς καὶ ἐμπείρως, τὸ ἀδίκως ἀγνοούντως καὶ ἀπείρως</foreign>. And again B 7, 113 <hi rend="italic">a</hi> 1 seq. <foreign lang="greek">αἱ μὲν οὖν πρῶται δύο κ.τ.λ.</foreign>...line 8, <foreign lang="greek">τὰ δὲ λοιπὰ πάντα τέτταρα ποιεῖ ἐναντίωσιν. τὸ γὰρ τοὺς φίλους εὖ ποιεῖν τῷ τοὺς φίλους κακῶς ἐναντίον· ἀπό τε γὰρ ἐναντίου ἤθους ἐστί, καὶ τὸ μὲν αἱρετὸν τὸ δὲ φευκτόν</foreign>. &ldquo;But the other four combinations, benefiting a friend, hurting a friend: benefiting an enemy, hurting an enemy: benefiting a friend, benefiting an enemy: hurting a friend, hurting an enemy: are all respectively contraries.&rdquo; Poste, u. s. p. 201. </p>
					</div3>
					<div3 id="b2c25s6" type="section" n="6">
						<p>&lsquo;An example of an objection from <hi rend="italic">similars</hi> (is the following), suppose the enthymeme (i. e. the premiss, as before,) to be, that those who have been injured always hate, (it may be met by the objection,) &ldquo;nay but, neither (no more than in the other case) do those who have been well treated always love&rdquo;&rsquo;. This, as Victorius observes, may plainly be taken as an example of the preceding kind of <foreign lang="greek">ἔνστασις ἀπὸ τοῦ ἐναντίου</foreign>. It may also exemplify that of &lsquo;similars&rsquo;, to which Arist. has here applied it. Ill treatment is no necessary proof of hatred, any more than kindness and benefits are necessarily accompanied by love. The premiss, &lsquo;those who are injured always hate&rsquo;, we encounter with the objection, of a <hi rend="italic">similar, parallel</hi>, case, that &lsquo;those who are well treated don't always love&rsquo;. <pb n="326"/> </p>
						<p>Parallel cases are also illustrated in Top. B 10, 114 <hi rend="italic">b</hi> 25, but not as objections, though objections might be derived from them. </p>
					</div3>
					<div3 id="b2c25s7" type="section" n="7">
						<p>A fourth kind is that of, &lsquo;judgments, or decisions proceeding from distinguished men: as for instance, if the enthymeme be, that drunkards should have allowance made for them (and be punished less severely than if they had been in their sober senses), because they sin in ignorance, an objection may be taken, that then Pittacus is no longer commendable (i. e. loses his due credit; is no longer an <hi rend="italic">authority</hi>, as he is entitled to be); for (if he had been&mdash;on the supposition that the enthymeme objected to is true,) he would not have enacted (as he did) a heavier penalty for an offence committed under the influence of intoxication&rsquo;. The <hi rend="italic">authority</hi> of Pittacus, which is of course maintained by the objector, is urged in opposition to the general principle laid down by the opponent, that indulgence should be granted to those who committed a crime in a fit of intoxication, because they were then out of their senses and had lost all self-control. </p>
						<p>If this were true, replies the objector, Pittacus, one of the seven &ldquo;wise men,&rdquo; would be no authority&mdash;which cannot be supposed&mdash;for he ruled the direct contrary, that drunkenness aggravated, not extenuated, the offence. The text, with the supplements usually required in translating Aristotle, seems to give a clear and consistent sense. Vahlen however, <hi rend="italic">Trans. Vien. Acad.</hi> Oct. 1861, p. 141, objects to <foreign lang="greek">αἰνετός</foreign> on two grounds; first, the word itself, as belonging only to <hi rend="italic">poetry;</hi> and secondly as inapplicable here; the meaning required being, that Pittacus is no <hi rend="italic">wise</hi> man, for otherwise he would not have made such an enactment: that we must therefore read <foreign lang="greek">συνετός</foreign> for <foreign lang="greek">αἰνετός</foreign>. On the second ground I can see no necessity for alteration; for the first objection, there is more to be said. <foreign lang="greek">αἰνετός</foreign> is a <hi rend="italic">very</hi> rare word: only two examples of it are given in Steph. <hi rend="italic">Thes.</hi> (this place of Aristotle is strangely overlooked) and both from <hi rend="italic">poets</hi>, Antimachus and Alcaeus. Whether this is a sufficient reason for condemning the word in Aristotle I will not take upon me to decide. It is retained by all editors; and Aristotle's writings are not altogether free from irregularities of grammar and expression not sanctioned by the usage of the best Attic writers. For instance, <foreign lang="greek">κυντότατον</foreign> is quoted in Bekker's <hi rend="italic">Anecdota</hi>, I 101, as occurring in the <foreign lang="greek">περὶ ποιητικῆς</foreign>&mdash;doubtless in the lost part of that work. </p>

Vahlen truly observes, Op. cit. p. 141, &ldquo;that the <foreign lang="greek">τεκμήριον</foreign> rests not upon the necessary <hi rend="italic">and being</hi>, but upon the necessary and <hi rend="italic">ever-being</hi>,&rdquo; (the permanent and invariable): referring to <foreign lang="greek">ἀεὶ καὶ ἀναγκαῖον</foreign> in &sect; 10; Phys.

Bekker, who had adopted the altered punctuation in his 2nd ed., has returned to the original one in his 3rd, whether by mere oversight, or intentionally, who can determine? At all events with the punctuation found in all the editions prior to Bekker's 2nd, the sentences appear to be unintelligible. Vahlen, u.s., pp. 142, 3, has adopted the same alterations with the addition of the not improbable but unnecessary one of <foreign lang="greek">ἐάν τε γὰρ ἔχωμεν ἕν τι</foreign>. The connexion of the passage thus altered is this: There are two ways of meeting and refuting an opponent's example, the rhetorical substitute for a complete induction: first, if we have an adverse or contradictory instance (<foreign lang="greek">οὐχ οὕτω</foreign>) to bring against his general rule&mdash;a case exceptional to the example or examples that he has collected in support of it&mdash;this is refuted, at all events so far as to shew that it is not <hi rend="italic">necessary</hi>, even though the majority of cases (<foreign lang="greek">πλείω καὶ πλεονάκις</foreign>, &lsquo;more of them and oftener&rsquo;) of the same kind, or examples, are &lsquo;otherwise&rsquo; (<foreign lang="greek">ἄλλως</foreign>, are in another direction, or go to prove the contrary): or, secondly, if the great majority of instances are in conformity with his rule (<foreign lang="greek">οὕτως</foreign>), and (which must be supplied) we have no instance to the contrary to adduce, we must then contend that the present instance (any one of his examples) is not analogous, not a case in point, that there is some difference either of kind and quality, or of mode, or some other, whatever it may be, between the example and that with which he compares it, which prevents its applicability here. The objection to this connexion and interpretation is of course the combination of <foreign lang="greek">οὐχ οὕτω</foreign> with <foreign lang="greek">ἐάν</foreign>; which may perhaps have been Bekker's reason for returning to the original punctuation. But as the sense seems to require the alteration of this, we may perhaps apply to this case Hermann's explanation<note anchored="yes">Review of Elmsley's Medea, vv. 87, 348. [Comp. <hi rend="italic">supra</hi> Vol. I. Appendix C, p. 301.]</note> of the conjunction of <foreign lang="greek">οὐ</foreign>, the direct negative with the hypothetical <foreign lang="greek">εἰ</foreign>, which may occur in cases where the negative is immediately connected, so as to form a single negative notion with the thing denied, and does not belong to the hypothesis: so that <foreign lang="greek">οὐχ οὕτως</foreign> being equivalent to <foreign lang="greek">ἄλλο</foreign> or <foreign lang="greek">ἕτερον</foreign> may stand in its place with the hypothetical particle: though no other example of this combination with <foreign lang="greek">ἐάν</foreign> has been produced. In the choice between the two difficulties, the grammar, I suppose, must give place to the requirements of the sense. Neither Vahlen nor Spengel takes any notice of the grammatical irregularity. </p>

But amplification and depreciation are enthymemes or inferences to prove that anything is great or little (to exaggerate and exalt, or disparage, depreciate, lower it), just as there are enthymemes to prove that anything is good or bad, or just or unjust, and anything else of the same kind&rsquo;.

III 1. 7, and &lsquo;the Poetics&rsquo;.</note>, whence we are to obtain a supply of them, and how refute them, let us be satisfied with what has been already said: style and order (of the parts of the speech) remain for discussion&rsquo;. </p>
						<p>Dionys., de Comp. Verb. C. I. divides the art of composition into two branches, <foreign lang="greek">διττῆς οὔσης ἀσκήσεως περὶ πάντας τοὺς λόγους</foreign>, viz. (1) <foreign lang="greek">ὁ πραγματικὸς τόπος</foreign>, the facts, or matter&mdash;Ar.'s <foreign lang="greek">πίστεις</foreign> (in Rhetoric)&mdash;and (2) <foreign lang="greek">λεκτικός</foreign>, the style or manner. The latter is again subdivided into <foreign lang="greek">σύνθεσις</foreign>, &lsquo;composition&rsquo;, combination, construction of words in <hi rend="italic">sentences</hi>, and <foreign lang="greek">ἐκλογὴ τῶν ὀνομάτων</foreign>, selection of single words. </p>
						<p>This (with the <hi rend="italic">possible</hi> exception of <foreign lang="greek">τὰ λοιπά</foreign> in II 18. 5) is the first notice we have in this work that there <hi rend="italic">is</hi> anything to consider in Rhetoric beyond the proofs or <foreign lang="greek">πίστεις</foreign> that are to be employed in persuasion; and the omission of any distinct mention of it up to this point is certainly remarkable. Of course those who regard the third book as not belonging to the system of Rhetoric embodied in the two first&mdash; (no one, except Rose, I think, goes so far as to deny the genuineness of the book as a work of Aristotle)&mdash;but as a separate treatise, founded on a different conception of the art, improperly attached to the foregoing, assume that the last words, <foreign lang="greek">λοιπὸν δὲ...τάξεως</foreign>, are a subsequent interpolation added to connect the second book with the third. Vahlen, <hi rend="italic">Trans. Vien. Acad.</hi> Oct. 1861, pp. 131, 2, has again shewn that arbitrary and somewhat dogmatical positiveness which characterises his criticism of Aristotle's text. He pronounces, that of the last section, only the words which he alters into <foreign lang="greek">περὶ μὲν οὖν παραδειγμάτωνεἰρήσθω ἡμῖν τοσαῦτα</foreign> (omitting <foreign lang="greek">καὶ ὅλως τῶν περὶ τὴν διάνοιαν</foreign>)&mdash;that is to say, only those which <pb n="334"/> happen to agree with his theory, that the third book did not form part of the original plan of the work, &ldquo;are to be regarded as genuine Aristotelian.&rdquo; The promised proof of this theory, is, I believe, not yet forthcoming. </p>
						<p>Brandis is much more reasonable, <hi rend="italic">Tract on Rhet.</hi> [<hi rend="italic">Philologus</hi> IV i.] p. 7,8. He thinks that the second and third parts (the contents of Bk. III, <foreign lang="greek">λέξις</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">τάξις</foreign>) are already presupposed in the conception of the art expressed in the preface to the work. (This is certainly nowhere distinctly stated, and the <foreign lang="greek">προσθῆκαι</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">τὰ ἔξω τοῦ πράγματος</foreign> of I 1. 3 seem rather to refer to the exaggerations and appeals to the feelings and such like topics, of which the &lsquo;arts&rsquo; of the earlier professors were mainly composed. Still, <hi rend="italic">the tricks of style</hi>, introduced by Gorgias and his followers into their arts, may be included with the others, E. M. C). One of the hypotheses suggested by Brandis on the relation of this third book to the two others seems to me highly probable. It is that the third book&mdash; which is in fact complete in itself (E. M. C.)&mdash;was written earlier than the rest, and before the author had arrived at his final conception of Rhetoric in its connexion with Logic; and was afterwards appended to the two others, instead of a new treatise written specially with a view to them; and this would account for the repetitions, such as that of III 17, which certainly are difficult to explain, if the third book be supposed to have been written after, and in connexion with, the first and second. With regard to the references, as in cc. 1 and 10, to one of the preceding books, Brandis thinks they might easily have been introduced <hi rend="italic">after the addition</hi> of the third to the two others. He altogether rejects the notion that any one but Aristotle could have been the author of it. (It has in fact all the characteristics of Aristotle's style, mode of thought and expression, and nothing whatever which is out of character with him: on the other hand let any two sentences in this book and the Rhet. ad Alex. be compared, and it is seen at once that the style, manner, and mode of treatment are all totally different. E. M. C.) Lastly he notes that it is characteristic of Aristotle's writings (this, I think, deserves attention) <hi rend="italic">not</hi> to give a full account of the contents of the work at the beginning of it; and such omission of style and arrangement was all the more likely in the Rhetoric in so far as it was part of Aristotle's theory of the art that everything but proof direct or indirect was non-essential and completely subordinate. He concludes, &ldquo;I think therefore that I need not retract the expression I ventured on above (<hi rend="italic">Sie ist ein werk aus einem gusse</hi>) that the Rhetoric is, more than most of Aristotle's writings, a work made at one cast.&rdquo;

					<p>In the Introduction, pp. 276&mdash;370, I have already given a complete paraphrase of the contents of this book, exhibiting the main divisions and general principles of arrangement and the connexion of its several parts: and have added, in five appendices, dissertations on some special points which seemed to require a more detailed treatment than they could conveniently receive in mere notes. Referring to this for information on all such general matters, I may confine myself in the commentary to special details of language, allusion, and such like particulars. This book, by the extreme brevity of expression which characterises it, leaving even more than usual to the reader's ingenuity to supply, by the consequent difficulty of translation, and the obscurity of many of the allusions, offers at least as many impediments and stumblingblocks to the embarrassed commentator as either of the two preceding; and it is to be feared that the explanation and illustration are not likely to be much shorter than before, in spite of what has been already done in the Introduction. </p>
					<p>With the end of Book II we finish the treatment of what (according to the Latin division) is termed <hi rend="italic">inventio</hi>, the invention and supply of all the various kinds of arguments, which the orator has to invent, or find for himself; and we now proceed to the analysis of (1) <foreign lang="greek">λέξις</foreign>, <hi rend="italic">elocutio</hi>, verbal style, including <foreign lang="greek">ὑπόκρισις</foreign>, delivery, <hi rend="italic">pronuntiatio</hi> and <hi rend="italic">actio</hi>, (Aristotle omits the latter, at all events in the treatment of it, confining <foreign lang="greek">ὑπόκρισις</foreign> to <hi rend="italic">the mode of speaking</hi>, declamation, &sect; 4): and (2) <foreign lang="greek">τάξις</foreign>, the order and disposition, together with the ordinary topics, of the several divisions of the speech. The first is examined in the first twelve chapters, the second from the thirteenth to the end. These three general divisions of the art are expressed by Cicero, Orator &sect; 43, <hi rend="italic">tria videnda sunt oratori, quid dicat</hi> (<foreign lang="greek">πίστεις</foreign>), <hi rend="italic">quo quidque loco</hi> (<foreign lang="greek">τάξις</foreign>), <hi rend="italic">et quomodo</hi> (<foreign lang="greek">λέξις</foreign>). </p>

The tone of voice, the expression of the features, the gestures employed, the kind of language used, quite independently of the arguments, will materially assist the impression of moral (or any particular) character which the orator wishes to assume, on the minds of the audience. The <foreign lang="greek">ἦθος</foreign> of III 16.8 is part of this, the moral character imparted by the choice of language, of terms, tone and expression, significant of moral purpose, <foreign lang="greek">προαίρεσις</foreign>. </p>

						<p>&lsquo;Now first of all, inquiry was naturally directed to that which is first in the natural order, the sources from which things themselves derive their plausibility or power of persuasion&rsquo; (i. e. what are the sources of rhetorical proof of facts themselves; which of course is the basis of the entire art or practice, and therefore &lsquo;first in the order of nature&rsquo;); &lsquo;and secondly, the due setting out (disposal) of these by the language; <pb n="3"/> and thirdly (<foreign lang="greek">τούτων</foreign>, of such things as these, the divisions of Rhetoric), what has the greatest force (or influence, <hi rend="italic">is especially effective</hi> as a means of persuasion), but has not yet been attempted (regularly, systematically, as an art, no serious attempt has yet been made upon it), that which relates to <hi rend="italic">delivery</hi>&rsquo;. </p>
						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">πρῶτον ἐζητήθη κατὰ φύσιν</lemma>] A similar phraseology occurs at the beginning of the Poetics, I 1, ult. <foreign lang="greek">ἀρξάμενοι κατὰ φύσιν πρῶτον ἀπὸ τῶν πρώτων</foreign>. And de Soph. El. init. <foreign lang="greek">ἀρξάμενοι κατὰ φύσιν ἀπὸ τῶν πρώτων</foreign>. Victorius. </p>
						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">διαθέσθαι</lemma>] denotes the &lsquo;disposal&rsquo; or &lsquo;disposition&rsquo;, i. e. the investing of the speech with a certain character, putting it in a certain state, by the use of language: as the <foreign lang="greek">ἀκροαταί</foreign> of a speech are said <foreign lang="greek">διατίθεσθαί πως</foreign>, to be brought into such and such a disposition or state of feeling by it: a common use of the verb. It does not mean here distribution, ordering, arrangement, which is not the special office of the graces and proprieties of language or style. There is another sense in which this verb is used by later writers, as Polybius, Dionysius, Diodorus, with <foreign lang="greek">λόγους</foreign> and the like, <hi rend="italic">disponere, in publicum proponere, in medium proferre</hi>, to <hi rend="italic">dispose</hi> or <hi rend="italic">set out</hi> (<foreign lang="greek">διά</foreign>), as wares in a market for sale, <hi rend="italic">&eacute;taler;</hi> which may <hi rend="italic">possibly</hi> be the meaning here, though, I think, it would be less appropriate. Victorius renders it <hi rend="italic">explanare.</hi> <foreign lang="greek">διάθεσις</foreign>, in Longinus quoted below, seems to correspond to <foreign lang="greek">διατίθεσθαι</foreign> here in the sense in which I have explained it. </p>
						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ἐπικεχείρηται</lemma>] is a striking instance of that abnormal formation of the passive, which I have explained and illustrated in Appendix B on I 12. 22 [Vol. I. p. 297]. </p>
						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ὑπόκρισις</lemma>, &lsquo;acting&rsquo;, properly includes, besides declamation, the management of the voice, to which Aristotle, as already mentioned, here confines it, &sect; 4, that of the features, arms, hands, and the entire body: and so it is treated by the Latin rhetoricians, Cicero, Quintilian, &amp;c. Longinus, Ars Rhet., (apud Spengel, <hi rend="italic">Rhet. Gr.</hi> I 310,) has a chapter upon it, following another <foreign lang="greek">περὶ λέξεως</foreign>. His description of it is, <foreign lang="greek">μίμησις τῶν κατ’  ἀλήθειαν ἑκάστῳ παρισταμένων ἠθῶν καὶ παθῶν καὶ διάθεσις σώματός τε καὶ τόνου φωνῆς πρόσφορος τοῖς ὑποκειμένοις πράγμασιν. δύναται δὲ μέγιστον εἰς πίστιν κ.τ.λ.</foreign> Dionysius, de admirabili vi dicendi in Demosthene, c. 22, p. 1023 (Reiske), says of the great orator, <foreign lang="greek">κοσμοῦντος ἅπαντα καὶ χρηματίζοντος</foreign> (<foreign lang="greek">σχηματίζοντος</foreign>, Sylburg) <foreign lang="greek">τῇ πρεπούσῃ ὑποκρίσει ἧς δεινότατος ἀσκητὴς ἐγένετο, ὡς ἅπαντές τε ὁμολογοῦσι καὶ ἐξ αὐτῶν ἰδεῖν ἔστι τῶν λόγων, κ.τ.λ.</foreign> See Quint. XI 3. 5, on the effect of <hi rend="italic">pronuntiatio</hi>, &lsquo;delivery, declamation&rsquo;, where he says that even an indifferent speech set off by the vigour and grace of action will have more weight or effect than the very best without it: in &sect; 6 he quotes the opinion of Demosthenes, who assigned successively the first, second, and third place to declamation (<hi rend="italic">pronuntiatio</hi>), and so on till his questioner stopped. In &sect; 7 he quotes Aeschines' saying to the <pb n="4"/> Rhodians, who were admiring the <hi rend="italic">de Corona</hi> as he recited it to them, <hi rend="italic">Quid si ipsum audissetis? et M. Cicero unam in dicendo actionem dominari putat.</hi> Cic. de Or. III 56. 213, from which the whole passage of Quintilian is taken. Also Brutus, LXVI 234, Lentulus' opinion. XXXVIII 141, 142. XLIII 168 (Spalding ad loc. Quint.). On Demosthenes' dictum, Bacon, <hi rend="italic">Essays</hi>, Of Boldnesse, init., has this remark: A strange thing that that part of an Oratour which is but superficiall, and rather the vertue of a Player, should be placed so high above those other noble parts of Invention, Elocution, and the rest; nay almost alone, as if it were all in all. But the reason is plaine. There is in humane Nature generally more of the foole then of the wise; and therefore those faculties by which the foolish part of men's mindes is taken are most potent. </p>
						<p>&lsquo;(And this is not at all surprising) because in fact it was not till late that it made its way into the tragic art and rhapsody; for the poets at first (in the earliest stages of the drama) used to act their tragedies themselves&rsquo; (and therefore, as there was no profession of acting or professional actors, it was not likely that an art of acting should be constructed; the poets acted, as they wrote, as well as they could by the light of nature, without any rules of art). </p>

VII 2, <hi rend="italic">Livius &mdash;idem scilicet, id quod omnes tum erant, suorum carminum actor.</hi> Victorius thinks that this statement is confirmed by Hor. A. P. 277, <hi rend="italic">quae canerent agerentque peruncti faecibus ora</hi>, which means that &lsquo;the poets themselves had their faces smeared&rsquo;. Donaldson, <hi rend="italic">Theatre of the Greeks</hi>, Ed. vii. p. 59, n. 10. </p>
						<p>&lsquo;It is plain then that there is something of this kind in Rhetoric also as well as in poetry&rsquo; (declamation may be studied and practised for the purposes of Rhetoric, as well as for those of acting in tragedy and comedy or of rhapsodical recitation): &lsquo;which, in fact, (i. e. the &lsquo;poetical&rsquo; declamation), has been dealt with (treated artistically, see note on I 1. 3), besides others, by Glaucon of Teos in particular&rsquo;. </p>
						<p>This tautological repetition of <foreign lang="greek">καί, καὶ περὶ τὴν ῥητορικήν, καὶ περὶ τὴν ποιητικήν</foreign>, is not unfrequent in Aristotle. Compare Pol. I 2, 1252 <hi rend="italic">b</hi> 26, <foreign lang="greek">ὥσπερ δὲ καὶ τὰ εἴδηοὕτω καὶ τοὺς βίους τῶν θεῶν</foreign>. Ib. 1253 <hi rend="italic">a</hi> 31, <foreign lang="greek">ὥσπερ γὰρ καὶ τελεωθένοὕτω καὶ χωρισθέν</foreign>. </p>
						<p>Glaucon of Teos, an Ionian city on the coast of Asia Minor, is most probably the same as a Glaucon mentioned by Ion, Plat. Ion 530 D (so Stallbaum's note ad loc.), as following his own profession as a rhapsodist, which seems suitable enough for one who writes on the art of tragic declamation, especially as acting and rhapsodizing are actually coupled <pb n="5"/> together by Aristotle in the preceding sentence. I should be disposed also to identify with him of Teos, the Glaucon quoted in Poet. XXV 23 &mdash;seemingly as a poetical critic, which is also a kindred pursuit. See in Smith's <hi rend="italic">Biogr. Dict.</hi> the <hi rend="italic">third</hi> article on Glaucon. </p>
						<p>Tyrrwhitt ad loc. Poet. seems in favour of the supposition that the three Glaucons are one. A Glaucon who wrote a work on <foreign lang="greek">γλῶσσαι</foreign> (sic), Athen. XI 480 F, was at all events not far removed from the same studies. Schneider, ad Xen. Conv. III 6. </p>

						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ἔστι δ’  αὐτή</lemma>] So all MSS and Edd., except Buhle, who reads <foreign lang="greek">αὕτη</foreign>. This surely must be right: <foreign lang="greek">αὐτή</foreign> seems to have no meaning here. Victorius retaining <foreign lang="greek">αὐτή</foreign> translates &lsquo;<hi rend="italic">haec</hi>&rsquo;. </p>
						<p>&lsquo;This (declamation, <foreign lang="greek">ὑπόκρισις</foreign>) resides in the voice, in the mode of employing it, that is, for (the expression of) any emotion; that is to say, sometimes loud, sometimes low, sometimes intermediate (between the two, middling, neither the one nor the other); and in the mode of employing the accents (or <hi rend="italic">tones</hi> of voice), that is to say acute, grave, middle&rsquo; (circumflex, from the combination of the two others, <foreign lang="greek">́̀</foreign> = ~), &lsquo;and certain measures (times) in respect of each. For there are three things that are the subjects of such enquiries, magnitude (intensity, volume of sound), tune, time&rsquo;. </p>
						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">οἷον</lemma>] is here in both cases <hi rend="italic">videlicet</hi>, &lsquo;that is to say&rsquo;, a direct specification of certain definite things; not, as usual, &lsquo;for instance&rsquo;, as an example or specimen, which supposes <hi rend="italic">other</hi> things of the same kind, besides those expressly mentioned. Thus <foreign lang="greek">οἷον</foreign> here does not mean that the three kinds of sounds and accents mentioned are mere <hi rend="italic">examples</hi> of a much larger class, but they <hi rend="italic">specify</hi> the exact number of kinds which are intended to be distinguished in either case. This is common in Aristotle. Instances are, few out of many, Pol. I 6, sub fin., <foreign lang="greek">δοῦλος μέρος τι τοῦ δεσπότου, οἷον ἔμψυχον...μέρος</foreign>. c. 7 sub fin. <foreign lang="greek">ἡ δὲ κτητική...οἷον ἡ δικαία</foreign>. c. 8, 1256 <hi rend="italic">a</hi> 36, <foreign lang="greek">οἷον οἱ μὲν ἀπὸ λῃστείας κ.τ.λ.</foreign> c. 13, 1260 <hi rend="italic">a</hi> 6, <foreign lang="greek">οἷον τοῦ λόγον ἔχοντος καὶ τοῦ ἀλόγου</foreign>.

						<p>&lsquo;Now one might almost say (it is pretty nearly true to say) that these are the men that gain all the prizes in (<hi rend="italic">lit.</hi> out of, as the <hi rend="italic">produce</hi> or profit derived from, got out of them,) the contests (dramatic and rhapsodical), and as in these the actors have more power, influence, effect (over the audiences, and those who adjudge the prizes), than the poets nowadays, so likewise (has acting or declamation) in civil and social contests (the contests of the law-courts, and public assembly&mdash;comp. III 12. 2) by reason of the defects (the <hi rend="italic">vicious</hi>, depraved character) of our constitutions&rsquo; (as that of Athens, where I, Aristotle, am now writing). </p>
						<p>The vice or defect, which permits these irregular and extraneous appeals to the feelings, and the influence which &lsquo;acting&rsquo; thereby acquires, are attributed here to the <hi rend="italic">constitution</hi>&mdash;comp. I 1. 4, where &lsquo;well-governed states&rsquo;, <foreign lang="greek">εὐνομούμεναι πόλεις</foreign>, states which are under good laws and institutions, are said to forbid them: if that of Athens were sound and healthy and right, <foreign lang="greek">ὑγιής, ὀρθή</foreign>, opposed to <foreign lang="greek">μοχθηρά</foreign>, they would not be allowed <hi rend="italic">there.</hi> In the next section, 5, the defect is attributed to the <hi rend="italic">audience:</hi> in the one case the institutions themselves are in fault, in the other the tempers and disposition of the hearers, whose taste and judgment are so depraved that they <hi rend="italic">require</hi> the stimulus of these distorting (<foreign lang="greek">διαστρέφοντα</foreign>, I 1. 5) emotions. </p>
						<p>On the influence of <hi rend="italic">acting</hi> in producing emotion, and thereby persuasion, see by all means Cicero's description, de Or. III 56 &sect; 213, seq., which furnishes an excellent illustration of what is here said. Note particularly the case of Gracchus, &sect; 214. After a quotation from his speech Cicero adds, <hi rend="italic">quae sic ab illo csse</hi> acta <hi rend="italic">constabat oculis voce gestu, inimici ut lacrimas tenere non possent.</hi> And Orat. c.

						<p>&lsquo;But no art has been as yet composed of it; for in fact it was not till late that that of composition made any advance: and it (<foreign lang="greek">ἡ ὑποκριτική</foreign>) is thought low and vulgar&rsquo; (in the sense of popular and unsubstantial, directed to show, not substance) &lsquo;and rightly so considered&rsquo; (or, &lsquo;when considered aright&rsquo;; so Victorius. But the other is the more <hi rend="italic">natural</hi> interpretation of <foreign lang="greek">ὑπολαμβάνειν</foreign>; which will not in fact bear the meaning assigned to it by Victorius &lsquo;Si vere <hi rend="italic">iudicare</hi> volumus&rsquo;: &lsquo;consider&rsquo; in the two renderings has <hi rend="italic">different</hi> senses). </p>

See Twining on Poet. note 263, pp. 540&mdash;544, where a number of examples illustrative of its various applications are collected. <foreign lang="greek">φορτικῶς, ἐπαχθῶς, ἐπιπλάστως</foreign> (Suidas). The last of these two equivalents helps to explain a distinction in Eth. Eudem. I 4. 2, of arts <foreign lang="greek">φορτικαί, περὶ χρηματισμόν</foreign> (engaged in money-making, mercenary), <foreign lang="greek">βάναυσοι</foreign> (mechanical), which is subsequently explained, <foreign lang="greek">λέγω δὲ φορτικὰς μὲν τὰς πρὸς δόξαν πραγματευομένας μόνον</foreign>. This I suppose must be meant of arts that have nothing solid and substantial about them, but aim at mere outside show, ostentatious and hollow, <foreign lang="greek">πρὸς δόξαν</foreign> contrasted with <foreign lang="greek">πρὸς ἀλήθειαν</foreign>: and <foreign lang="greek">ἐπιπλάστως</foreign> &lsquo;beplastered&rsquo; seems to correspond to this. And this same signification is plainly conveyed by the word here in the Rhetoric, which is immediately followed by <foreign lang="greek">ἀλλ’  ὅλης οὔσης πρὸς δόξαν τῆς πραγματείας</foreign>, i. e. not only <foreign lang="greek">ὑποκριτική</foreign>, but the whole of Rhetoric, is directed <foreign lang="greek">πρὸς δόξαν</foreign>. So that <foreign lang="greek">φορτικόν</foreign> here must stand, as it often does, for the vulgarity which is shewn in unphilosophical habits of mind, want of mental cultivation in persons: and, as applied to a study or art, may signify popular, showy, unsubstantial, and in this point of view too low and vulgar to be entertained by a man of science or philosopher. It has precisely the same meaning in Pol. I 11, 1258 <hi rend="italic">b</hi> 35. See Eaton ad loc. </p>
						<p>&lsquo;But since the entire study and business of Rhetoric is directed to mere opinion, is unscientific, (directed to <foreign lang="greek">τὸ δοκεῖν</foreign>, mere outward show, not <foreign lang="greek">τὸ εἶναι</foreign>: I 7. 36&mdash;37, see note,) we must bestow the requisite (<foreign lang="greek">τήν</foreign>) pains and attention upon it, not that it is right (to do so), but as necessary (for success in <hi rend="italic">persuading</hi>): for, as to strict justice, <hi rend="italic">that</hi> implies, (requires, <hi rend="italic">subaudi</hi> <foreign lang="greek">ἐστί</foreign>,) looking for no more in the delivery of the speech than (to speak it) in a manner which will give neither offence nor delight: for fairness requires that the case be fought on the facts alone, and therefore everything else outside the direct proof (of them) is superfluous: but still, as has been already said, they have vast influence by reason of the vice or defects (depraved taste and judgment) of the hearer&rsquo;.

						<p>&lsquo;And as the reputation which the poets acquired in spite of the simplicity of what they said (the silliness of the thoughts expressed) was thought (by those who imitated them) to be due to their language, it was for this reason that the language (of prose) first took a poetical colour, as that of Gorgias. And still, even at this day, the mass of the uneducated think the discourses of speakers of this kind mighty fine. Such however is not the fact, but the language of prose and poetry is distinct&rsquo;. </p>

Another of his death-bed utterances, <foreign lang="greek">ὥσπερ ἐκ σαπροῦ καὶ ῥέοντος συνοικίου ἀσμένως ἀπαλλάττομαι</foreign> (Thompson's ed. of the Gorgias, p. 184), may be illustrated by Waller's lines, <hi rend="italic">The soul's dark cottage, battered and decayed, Lets in new light through chinks that time has made</hi>]. </p>

From this curious coincidence it seems that &ldquo;mixed wine&rdquo; must have been proverbial for a concealed enemy: mixed wine, &lsquo;the mixing of liquors&rsquo;, being, as was supposed, of a much more intoxicating character than unmixed. Philinus is arguing against <foreign lang="greek">ποικίλη τροφή</foreign>: <hi rend="italic">simple</hi> food is always best. </p>
						<p>&lsquo;And as is the case with Theodorus' voice (<hi rend="italic">lit.</hi> Theodorus' voice is affected) in comparison with that of all the rest of the actors&rsquo; (there should be a colon, instead of a comma, at <foreign lang="greek">μεμιγμένους</foreign>: <foreign lang="greek">καὶ οἷον ἡ Θεοδώρου</foreign> is continued from <foreign lang="greek">τοῦτο γὰρ πιθανόν</foreign>: it is an instance of the art disguising art, an artificial voice assuming the appearance of one natural and simple): &lsquo;for <hi rend="italic">his</hi> voice <hi rend="italic">appears</hi> to be that of the speaker (though it is in reality disguised), but the others as though they belonged to other people&rsquo; (were <hi rend="italic">assumed</hi>, with the character represented). </p>
						<p>Theodorus, a celebrated tragic actor, is mentioned&mdash;generally with Polus or Aristodemus&mdash;by Dem. de F. L. &sect; 274, <hi rend="italic">bis;</hi> Arist. Pol.

						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">οἰκεῖον ὄνομα</lemma> expresses much the same thing by a different metaphor.

						<p>This is a parenthetical <hi rend="italic">note:</hi> it has little to do with Rhetoric except so far as it occupies common ground with poetry, in the use of synonyms. &lsquo;Of names (words) <hi rend="italic">homonyms</hi> (ambiguous words, with more than one meaning) are useful to the Sophist&rsquo; (the fallacious reasoner; see II 24. 2, the topic of <foreign lang="greek">ὁμωνυμία</foreign>, and the note)&mdash;&lsquo;for those are the (principal) instruments of his (logical) frauds or cheats; to the poet, <hi rend="italic">synonyms</hi>&rsquo;. The <hi rend="italic">homonym</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">synonym</hi> are defined at the commencement of the Categories. The former is a word of more than one signification, of which the several definitions do <hi rend="italic">not</hi> agree; so that the <hi rend="italic">name</hi> being the same, the one signification can be employed fallaciously for the other: synonyms are words which can be variously applied, in which the name and the definition (or meaning) <hi rend="italic">do</hi> agree; as animal, can be said with truth of man and ox. Trendelenburg, <hi rend="italic">El. Log. Ar.</hi> &sect; 42, p. 116, on synonyms. Of hononyms Quintilian says, Inst. Or.

						<p>&lsquo;By proper and synonymous I mean such words as <foreign lang="greek">πορεύεσθαι</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">βαδίζειν</foreign>: these are both of them proper and identical in meaning&rsquo;. According to Trendelenburg, u. s., <foreign lang="greek">πορεύεσθαι</foreign> is the <hi rend="italic">genus</hi> and <foreign lang="greek">βαδίζειν</foreign> the <hi rend="italic">species</hi>, both predicable of animals in the same sense: &ldquo;Aristoteles enim constanter vocabulum (<foreign lang="greek">συνώνυμος</foreign>) ita frequentavit, ut vel eiusdem generis formas vel genus et species, quatenus communi nomine comprehenduntur, synonyma diceret.&rdquo; The <hi rend="italic">use</hi> of these to the poet lies <pb n="20"/> in this, that they help him to give variety to his diction, and relieve him from the necessity of constantly repeating the same word. </p>

The <hi rend="italic">pleasure</hi> derived from metaphors is that we learn something from them; they bring into view hitherto unnoticed resemblances between things the most apparently dissimilar. <foreign lang="greek">τὸ εὖ μεταφέρειν τὸ το ὅμοιον θεωρεῖν</foreign>, Poet. XXII 17. Top. Z 2, 140 <hi rend="italic">a</hi> 9. This is the fourth kind of metaphor, that from analogy, and by far the commonest and most attractive. On the pleasure of learning, see I 11. 21 and 23, III 10. 2. </p>
						<p>&lsquo;And it can't be derived (acquired) from anyone else&rsquo;. This does not of course mean that one writer or speaker cannot <hi rend="italic">borrow</hi> a metaphor <pb n="21"/> from another; but that the invention of metaphors is a mark of original genius, and therefore cannot be <hi rend="italic">taught</hi>, derived from another in the way of instruction. Not that metaphors in general are <hi rend="italic">confined</hi> to men of genius, <foreign lang="greek">πάντες γὰρ μεταφοραῖς διαλέγονται</foreign>, &sect; 6; but they all shew originality more or less, and are marks of <hi rend="italic">natural</hi> (not acquired) ability, or genius, each in proportion to its merit. <foreign lang="greek">μόνον γὰρ τοῦτο</foreign> (<foreign lang="greek">τὸ μεταφορικόν</foreign>) <foreign lang="greek">οὔτε παρ’  ἄλλου ἔστι λαβεῖν, εὐφυΐας τε σημεῖόν ἐστιν· τὸ γὰρ εὖ μεταφέρειν τὸ τὸ ὅμοιον θεωρεῖν ἐστίν</foreign>. Poet. XXII 17. And therefore, the more remote the resemblance between the two objects brought together by the metaphor, the more ingenuity and natural ability is required for detecting it. </p>
						<p>Harris, <hi rend="italic">Philol. Inq.</hi>, Part II, ch. 10, takes this view of the meaning; &ldquo;that metaphor is an effort of genius and cannot be taught is here again (in the present passage) asserted in the words, <foreign lang="greek">καὶ λαβεῖν...παρ’  ἄλλου</foreign>.&rdquo; Whately, on the other hand, denies that this means, &ldquo;as some interpreters suppose, that this power is entirely a gift of nature, and in no degree to be learnt: on the contrary he expressly affirms that the &lsquo;perception of resemblances&rsquo; on which it depends is the fruit of &lsquo;philosophy&rsquo;: but he means that metaphors are not to be, like other words and phrases, selected from common use and transferred from one composition to another, but must be formed for the occasion&rdquo; [<hi rend="italic">Rhetoric</hi>, chap. III p. 277 ult.]. Whatever Aristotle may have said <hi rend="italic">elsewhere</hi>, it is certain that what he says in the <hi rend="italic">Poetics</hi>, and therefore in this passage which is repeated from it, is what Harris has described: the close connexion of <foreign lang="greek">παρ’  ἄλλου λαβεῖν</foreign> with the following <foreign lang="greek">εὐφυΐα</foreign> shews this unmistakably. Besides this, a remark about borrowing metaphors from other people's speeches or writings is not only trivial in itself, but here altogether out of place: and if it were not, why should metaphors be singled out from all other forms of speech as things that should not be borrowed? Is not purloining your neighbour's thoughts or expressions or <hi rend="italic">bons mots</hi> equally reprehensible in all cases? or may <foreign lang="greek">γλῶτται</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">πεποιημένα</foreign> and the rest, all of them be &lsquo;borrowed&rsquo;, and metaphors alone excepted? Victorius, according to Schrader, renders it, &ldquo;non licet <hi rend="italic">semper</hi> sumere ipsam ab alio auctore,&rdquo; which he approves, and interprets, that you musn't be always begging or borrowing your metaphors from others, when you can and ought to invent them yourself. In my copy of Vettori's Commentary [Petri Victorii Commentarii in Opera Aristotelis, 5 vols. folio, published at Florence, 1548&mdash;1583], these words do not occur: the passage is there explained, as it should be, of &lsquo;acquiring metaphors&rsquo; from any one but oneself: they being due to a natural ingenuity. Victorius also says that this remark, upon the inventive power which they presuppose, is introduced as an additional recommendation of metaphors: and refers to one of the topics of Top. III., the degrees of good, <foreign lang="greek">καὶ ὃ μὴ ἔστι παρ’  ἄλλου πορίσασθαι ἢ ὃ ἔστι παῤ ἄλλου</foreign>, what can't be procured from another, any <hi rend="italic">native</hi> excellence or advantage, is superior to anything that <hi rend="italic">can.</hi> Also c.

						<p>&lsquo;And if you want to set off anything (if praise is your object), you must take your metaphor from the superior (better, more honourable or valuable) things that fall under the same genus; if blame, from the inferior. As an instance of my meaning; since contraries are (the extremes of the <hi rend="italic">species</hi>) under the same <hi rend="italic">genus</hi>, to say that one that prays, begs, and one that begs, prays, is to do this; because both of them are kinds of petition&rsquo;. These are the two extremes of the <hi rend="italic">genus</hi> petition, or solicitation; praying the highest form, begging the lowest; &lsquo;as also (besides others, <foreign lang="greek">καί</foreign>) Iphicrates (called) Callias (whom he wished to depreciate) <foreign lang="greek">μητραγύρτης</foreign> instead of <foreign lang="greek">δᾳδοῦχος</foreign> [&lsquo;a mendicant priest&rsquo;, instead of &lsquo;bearer of the mystic torch&rsquo;]. The other (Callias) replied, that he (his opponent) never could have been initiated (or he would have been incapable of such a mistake), else he would not have called him <foreign lang="greek">μητραγύρτης</foreign> but <foreign lang="greek">δᾳδοῦχος</foreign>&mdash;for it is true (adds Aristotle, by way of explanation) that they are both attached to the service of a goddess (both come under the common genus &lsquo;servants of a goddess&rsquo;), but the one is a term of honour, the other of dishonour&rsquo;. It is much like calling the Precentor of a Cathedral a ballad-singer. </p>

						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">Καλλίας</lemma> is the third of that name, the son of the third Hipponicus, of that noble and wealthy Athenian family, of which the heads received these names alternately during several generations, Arist. Ran. 283, <foreign lang="greek">Ἱππόνικος Καλλίου κἀξ Ἱππονίκου Καλλίας</foreign>. The title of <foreign lang="greek">δᾳδοῦχος</foreign>, hereditary in his family, is especially assigned to him by Xenophon, Hellen. VI 3. 3, <foreign lang="greek">Καλλίας ὁ δᾳδοῦχος</foreign>. His pride in this distinction would of course have rendered him much more susceptible to the slight conveyed by Iphicrates' ignorant, or malicious, mistake. The substitution of the one word for the other, though evidently interpreted by Callias (from his reply) as a mistake made in ignorance of the distinction between the two&mdash;perhaps wilfully, to save his dignity&mdash;is much more likely to have been intentional and malicious. Callias was a vain foolish man&mdash; see Xenoph. l. c. &sect; 3, ult. and Callias' speech &sect;&sect; 4, 5, 6,&mdash;and Iphicrates, the self-made man, who had risen to distinction by his own merits, <foreign lang="greek">ἐξ οἵων εἰς οἷα</foreign>, would doubtless have enjoyed a joke at the expense of the pompous and empty &lsquo;descendant of Triptolemus&rsquo; (Xen. l. c.) and hereditary <foreign lang="greek">δᾳδοῦχος</foreign> of the Great Mysteries. Xenophon mentions him as one of the ambassadors to the congress at Sparta in 371 B. C., in virtue of his here<pb n="24"/> ditary <foreign lang="greek">προξενία</foreign> of that state. There is a good account of this Callias by Mr Elder in Smith's <hi rend="italic">Biogr.

On Callias and his family, its wealth and splendour, see B&ouml;ckh, <hi rend="italic">Publ. Econ. of Athens</hi>, Bk.

						<p>The <foreign lang="greek">δᾳδουχία</foreign> was, as we have seen, an office of great distinction.

						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">μητραγύρτης</lemma>, on the contrary, implies everything that is vile and contemptible: it is the designation of a class of profligate beggars, chiefly women, who attached themselves to the worship of some particular deity&mdash;usually Cybele, the <hi rend="italic">Magna Mater</hi>, from which <foreign lang="greek">μητραγύρτης</foreign> is taken&mdash;at whose festivals they attended to ply their profession, that of <foreign lang="greek">ἀγείρειν</foreign>, collecting alms, <hi rend="italic">stipem cogere</hi>, and then practised every kind of imposture and indulged in every variety of licentiousness. They seem also to have gone their rounds through the great houses in cities, Plat. Rep. II 364 B&mdash;C, fortune-telling, and with charms and spells (as to draw down the gods from heaven) and other nostrums for sale. They carried about with them an image of the goddess in whose name they asked alms. Lobeck, <hi rend="italic">Aglaophamus</hi>, p. 629, compares them to mendicant friars or <hi rend="italic">B&eacute;guines</hi>, and designates them <hi rend="italic">viles Metragyrtas.</hi> Menander wrote two or three plays upon them, the <foreign lang="greek">Θεοφορουμένη</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">Μητραγύρτης</foreign> (or <foreign lang="greek">Μηναγύρτης</foreign>, so Meineke, <hi rend="italic">Fr.

To this extremity Dionysius the younger, once tyrant of Syracuse, was finally reduced, <foreign lang="greek">αὐτὸς δὲ Διονύσιος τέλος μητραγυρτῶν καὶ τυμπανοφορούμενος οἰκτρῶς τὸν βίον κατέστρεψε</foreign>: Clearchus ap. Athen. 541 C (Victorius). The <foreign lang="greek">μητραγύρται</foreign>, male and female, did not confine themselves to a single goddess, though Cybele was their favourite, but also attached themselves to the service of Isis; and apparently to that of Demeter and Cora (from the present passage); of Opis and Arge, Hdt. IV 35; and in general, of those whose worship was of an <hi rend="italic">orgiastic</hi> character, see by all means Ruhnken ad Tim. p. 10, s. v. <foreign lang="greek">ἀγείρειν</foreign>. <hi rend="italic">Here</hi> there are two goddesses implied, Demeter in <foreign lang="greek">δᾳδοῦχος</foreign>, and Cybele in <foreign lang="greek">μητραγύρτης</foreign>.

						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ἀγείρειν</lemma> is used to signify collecting alms, or begging, several times by Herodotus; twice, for instance, in IV 35.

						<p>The next is a case of the same kind; of two possible designations of actors one takes the lowest and most contemptuous, the other the opposite and highest and most complimentary. <foreign lang="greek">Διονυσοκόλακες</foreign> represents them as parasites or flatterers, not worthy to be companions or friends of the god; the lowest and most degraded form of <hi rend="italic">service</hi>, of Dionysus the patron deity of the stage and its belongings (Aristophanes <hi rend="italic">passim</hi>) <foreign lang="greek">τεχνίται</foreign> as &lsquo;artists&rsquo;, or &lsquo;<hi rend="italic">artistes</hi>&rsquo;&mdash;as the lower kind of professional performers, singers, dancers, posture-makers, are fond of calling themselves nowadays by way of dignifying their profession: the term is actually applied to them by Dem. de F. L. &sect; 212, of Philip who collected at a festival <foreign lang="greek">πάντας τοὺς τεχνίτας</foreign>; on which Ulpian (quoted by Shilleto ad loc.) <foreign lang="greek">τοὺς ὑποκριτὰς οὕτω καλεῖ κωμικούς τε καὶ τραγικούς</foreign>. Shilleto adds, <hi rend="italic">ut aiunt in Graecis artificibus</hi>, Cic. pro Murena 13 (29). [Ar. Problems 30. 10, 956 <hi rend="italic">b</hi> 11, <foreign lang="greek">διὰ τί οἱ Διονυσιακοὶ τεχνῖται ὡς ἐπὶ τὸ πολὺ πονηροί εἰσιν</foreign>; referred to by Aulus Gellius, XX 4. Comp. Alciphron, III 48, (<foreign lang="greek">Λικύμνιον τὸν τραγῳδὸν</foreign>) <foreign lang="greek">ὃν ἐγὼ τῆς ἀχαρίστου φωνῆς ἕνεκα αὐτοκόρυδον καλεῖσθαι πρὸς ἡμῶν καὶ τοῦ χοροῦ τῶν Διονυσοκολάκων ἔκρινα</foreign> (Otto L&uuml;ders, <hi rend="italic">die Dionysischen K&uuml;nstler</hi>, 1873, pp. 58&mdash;63).] </p>
						<p>The common <hi rend="italic">genus</hi> or notion which unites <foreign lang="greek">Διονυσοκόλακες</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">τεχνῖται</foreign> as &lsquo;contraries&rsquo; is that of service to a deity: the <foreign lang="greek">τεχνῖται</foreign> as well as the <foreign lang="greek">κόλακες</foreign> being assumed as actors, to be devoted to his especial service. The distinction is that between true <hi rend="italic">art</hi>, and low buffoonery. This, as far as I can see, is the whole meaning of the passage. </p>
						<p>Victorius however, and Schweigh&auml;user on Athen. VI 249 F, drag in here, wholly as I can conceive beside the point, another sense of <foreign lang="greek">Διονυσοκόλακες</foreign> in which it was applied to the flatterers of Dionysius of Syracuse&mdash;of whose filthy and disgusting practices Theophrastus (quoted in Wyttenbach on Plut. p. 53, F) gives some revolting examples&mdash;in a double sense, of Dionysus and Dionysius: see their notes for the explanation of this. (It is supposed by them and Mr Shilleto u. s. to be a joke; if so, it is of a very frigid description.) Wyttenbach says (note ad Plut. l. c.) &ldquo;Actores scenici honesto nomine dicebantur <foreign lang="greek">οἱ περὶ Διόνυσον τεχνῖται</foreign>, per contemptum <foreign lang="greek">Διονυσοκόλακες</foreign>&rdquo;: which is no doubt all that is meant here, though he refers to Victorius' note, who makes a great deal more out of it. This special sense of <foreign lang="greek">τεχνῖται</foreign> is fully confirmed by another passage of Athen. V 198 B describing a magnificent procession of Ptolemy Philadelphus (cc. 25&mdash;30), <foreign lang="greek">μεθ’  οὓς ἐπορεύετο Φιλίσκος ὁ ποιητής, ἱερεὺς ὢν Διονύσου, καὶ πάντες οἱ περὶ τὸν Διόνυσον τεχνῖται</foreign>. It <pb n="26"/> occurs also in Diog. Laert. X 4. 8, Epicurus called <foreign lang="greek">τοὺς περὶ Πλάτωνα</foreign> (Plato's <hi rend="italic">followers</hi>) <foreign lang="greek">Διονυσοκόλακας, καὶ αὐτὸν Πλάτωνα χρυσοῦν</foreign> (which is translated &lsquo;<hi rend="italic">Dionysii</hi> assentatores&rsquo; in Cobet's <hi rend="italic">corrected</hi> version, though <hi rend="italic">Dionysius</hi> can surely have nothing to do with the matter, any more than here). Here also the word is a term of reproach; and seems by this time to have become <hi rend="italic">proverbial</hi> for gross and low flattery: &ldquo;tanquam assentatores eos, non sodales, insimulans.&rdquo; Victorius. Victorius understands the term, as here used, to express the lowest order of attendants on the stage (parasites of Bacchus), such as the scene-shifters, candle-snuffers, and such like menials of a modern theatre, but another passage of Athen. XI 538 F,&mdash;<foreign lang="greek">καὶ ἔκτοτε οἱ πρότερον καλούμενοι Διονυσοκόλακες Ἀλεξανδροκόλακες ἐκλήθησαν, διὰ τὰς τῶν δώρων ὑπερβολάς· ἐφ’  οἷς καὶ ἥσθη ὁ Ἀλέξανδρος</foreign>. This occurs in a list of the entertainments which were exhibited in a great marriage-feast given by Alexander after the capture of Darius, taken from a work of Chares, &lsquo;the histories of Alexander&rsquo;. Now whether <foreign lang="greek">ἐφ’  οἷς ἥσθη</foreign> refers to Alexander's delight at their gifts (neut.) or at themselves (masc.), that is, their acting, in either case their employment could not have been of the mean and degrading character attributed to it by Victorius&mdash;in the one case they were too rich, in the other, if they amused him, they must have been actors, or at all events above the degree of menials, though their acting may have been mere grimace and buffoonery. </p>
						<p>&lsquo;And one (to vex and lower them) calls them&rsquo; (whether this means any &lsquo;one&rsquo; in particular, we do not know) &lsquo;parasites of Dionysus (low buffoons), whereas they themselves style themselves <hi rend="italic">artists:</hi> and each of these is a metaphor (<hi rend="italic">artist</hi> as applied to them is a metaphor, I suppose, because the proper object of art is <hi rend="italic">production</hi>&mdash;<foreign lang="greek">τέχνη μέτα λόγου ποιητική, ταὐτὸν ἂν εἴη τέχνη καὶ ἕξις μετὰ λόγου ἀληθοῦς ποιητική</foreign>: and <foreign lang="greek">ποίησις</foreign> being distinguished from <foreign lang="greek">πρᾶξις, ἀνάγκη τὴν τέχνην ποιήσεως ἀλλ’  οὐ πράξεως εἶναι</foreign>.

						<p>&lsquo;A phrase like that of Euripides&rsquo; Telephus, &ldquo;He lords it over the oar (<hi rend="italic">sways</hi> it, like a sceptre, the emblem of royalty), and having on his departure for Mysia,&rdquo; is unbecoming (inappropriate), because <hi rend="italic">ruling, swaying, lording</hi>, is too big, pompous, for the value (measure, merits) (of the object described); and so, the disguise (concealment) is not effected (the art or effort becomes apparent, <hi rend="italic">supra</hi>, &sect; 5). </p>

						<p>&lsquo;And in general, from all ingenious, well-constructed, aenigmas good metaphors may be derived: for all metaphors convey (imply) an aenigma, plainly therefore a metaphor (so borrowed from a good aenigma) must be itself well converted (i. e. a well-selected metaphor)&rsquo;. Cicero thought less highly of aenigmas as a source of metaphors; at all events metaphors, accumulated till they become aenigmas, are reprehensible. De Or.

						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">κάλλος δὲ ὀνόματος</lemma>] Theophrastus, according to Demetrius <foreign lang="greek">περὶ ἑρμηνείας</foreign>, &sect;&sect; 173&mdash;5 (<hi rend="italic">Rhet. Gr.</hi> III 300, ed. Spengel), recognised three sources of beauty in words, (1) the appeal to the sight, the direct suggestion of beautiful objects by the words which are associated with them; (2) to the ear, by the sound of the words themselves; and thirdly <foreign lang="greek">διάνοια</foreign>, by the &lsquo;meaning&rsquo; or &lsquo;sense&rsquo;, Licymnius' <foreign lang="greek">σημαινόμενον</foreign>, and Aristotle's <foreign lang="greek">δυνάμει</foreign> the <hi rend="italic">vis</hi>, virtue, force, i. e. significance, its <hi rend="italic">power</hi> of suggestion. These are illustrated by Demetrius, l. c., the first by <foreign lang="greek">ῥοδόχροον, ἀνθοφόρου χρόας</foreign>: the second by <foreign lang="greek">Καλλίστρατος, Ἀννοῶν</foreign>, (the <foreign lang="greek">λλ</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">νν</foreign> seem <pb n="31"/> to have pleased his ear): and the third by <foreign lang="greek">ἀρχαῖος</foreign> as compared with <foreign lang="greek">παλαιός</foreign>, the former being suggestive of higher and nobler associations: <foreign lang="greek">οἱ γὰρ ἀρχαῖοι ἄνδρες ἐντιμότεροι</foreign>. It seems from this that the distinction between the first and third of these sources of beauty in a word is that the first is the <hi rend="italic">direct</hi> suggestion, by <hi rend="italic">word-painting</hi>, of a beautiful object of sight, as a rosy cheek or skin: the third is the remoter suggestion of beauty, <hi rend="italic">by inference</hi> from association, as <foreign lang="greek">ἀρχαῖος</foreign> suggests worth and respect; this form of suggestion has an intellectual character, and is therefore represented by Theophrastus as <foreign lang="greek">διάνοια</foreign>. To the direct suggestions of sight in the first class, Aristotle afterwards adds all the other senses&mdash;as music to the ear, a well-remembered flavour to the palate, smell to the nose, soft and warm things to the touch. The second of the three, is the actual sound of the word, <hi rend="italic">suggesting</hi> nothing else; Licymnius' <foreign lang="greek">ψόφοι</foreign>, and Theophrastus' and Demetrius' <foreign lang="greek">πρὸς ἀκοήν</foreign>. </p>
						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">τοῖς ψόφοις</lemma>] There are [as already remarked <hi rend="italic">supra</hi> p. 12, on I &sect; 9, <foreign lang="greek">διάλεκτος</foreign>], three degrees of <hi rend="italic">sound</hi> in an ascending scale. The first and lowest is <foreign lang="greek">ψόφος</foreign> &lsquo;noise&rsquo;, such as even inanimate things are capable of <hi rend="italic">when struck.</hi> The second is voice, <foreign lang="greek">φωνη</foreign> or <foreign lang="greek">φθόγγος</foreign>, (as distinguished from speech,) which is shared by all animals that have a <hi rend="italic">throat.</hi> The third is distinctive of the human race, <foreign lang="greek">διάλεκτος</foreign> (sometimes called <foreign lang="greek">λογός</foreign>), <hi rend="italic">discourse</hi>, articulate speech. <foreign lang="greek">ψόφος</foreign> as distinguished from <foreign lang="greek">φωνή</foreign> will include all <hi rend="italic">sounds</hi> which, though human, do not proceed from the voice and organs of speech: such as sneezing, coughing, hissing, whistling (<foreign lang="greek">ποππυσμός</foreign>) and so on. These particulars are taken from two passages, Ar. Hist. Anim. IV 9, 535 <hi rend="italic">a</hi> 27&mdash;<hi rend="italic">b</hi> 3, and Dion. de Comp. Verb. c. 14 (p. 72, Reiske).

Blass,  <hi rend="italic">die Attische Beredsamkeit.</hi> I 75, 76.] </p>
						<p>&lsquo;And again thirdly (a third observation upon metaphors), which solves (furnishes an answer to, serves to refute) the sophistical argument (theory or position); for it is <hi rend="italic">not</hi> true, as Bryson said, that no one ever uses (that there is no such thing as) foul or indecent language, if (if&mdash;as the case really is, i. e. since or because) the same thing is signified by saying this or that (by using the broad word or disguising it by a veil of <foreign lang="greek">ὑποκορισμός</foreign>), for this is false: for one term is more <hi rend="italic">properly</hi> applied to an object than another (represents it more <hi rend="italic">literally</hi> and directly), and is more assimilated to it, and more nearly <hi rend="italic">akin</hi> to it, by setting the <pb n="32"/> thing more directly before the eyes (and so making it more <hi rend="italic">vivid, striking</hi>, and <hi rend="italic">impressive</hi>)&rsquo;. </p>
						<p>Of Bryson, I have collected what is known in <hi rend="italic">Camb. Journ. of Cl. and Sacred Phil.</hi> No. v Vol. II pp. 143&mdash;6. In this dogma of the impossibility of indecent language he seems to have anticipated the Stoics&mdash;see Cicero's famous letter to Paetus on this Stoic <hi rend="italic">libertas loquendi</hi>, u. s. p. 144 note. <hi rend="italic">Suo quamque rem nomine appellare</hi> was their statement of this &lsquo;liberty&rsquo;, to call everything its right and proper name without shame or disguise, to call a spade a spade, to use the language of a Swift or Aristophanes. Aristotle answers Bryson by a simple denial of the fact. It is <hi rend="italic">not</hi> true that there is no difference in the use of words in respect of their moral effect upon us; the broad and literal expression presents the abomination much more vividly and impressively to the mind, naked as it were, than the same notion when half hidden from the view by a decent veil which conceals a great deal of its deformity. On this subject of plain speaking, besides Cicero's letter to Paetus (ad Div. IX 22), already referred to, see Cic. de Off. I 35. 128 where the Stoics are again introduced. Cicero takes the moral and delicate side of the question. Eth. N. IV 14, 1128 <hi rend="italic">a</hi> 23, <foreign lang="greek">ἴδοι δ’  ἄν τις καὶ ἐκ τῶν κωμωδιῶν τῶν παλαιῶν καὶ τῶν καινῶν· τοῖς μὲν ἦν γελοῖον ἡ αἰσχρολογία, τοῖς δὲ μᾶλλον ἡ ὑπόνοια</foreign> (the covert insinuation: this is the difference between coarse and refined indelicacy). Ar.'s opinion upon the subject is given much more strongly and decidedly, Pol. IV (VII) 17, 1336 <hi rend="italic">b</hi> 3, <foreign lang="greek">ὅλως μὲν οὖν αἰσχρολογίαν ἐκ τῆς πόλεως, εἴπερ ἄλλο τι, δεῖ τὸν νομοθέτην ἐξορίζειν· ἐκ τοῦ γὰρ εὐχερῶς λέγειν ὁτιοῦν τῶν αἰσχρῶν γίνεται καὶ τὸ ποιεῖν σύνεγγυς</foreign>. Perhaps one of the wisest observations the author ever made. Comp. Quint. VI 3.29. </p>
						<p>&lsquo;And besides, it is not under the same conditions and circumstances that it signifies this or that, so that on this ground again we must assume that one (mode of expression) is fairer or fouler than another: for though both of them <hi rend="italic">do</hi> express (or signify) beauty and deformity, yet not <hi rend="italic">qua</hi> beautiful and deformed (in so far as they are beautiful and the reverse, <hi rend="italic">and in no other respect</hi>)<hi rend="italic">:</hi> or, if the latter also, at all events in different degrees&rsquo;. These two different effects of <foreign lang="greek">αἰσχρολογία</foreign> seem to be thus distinguishable. We are first told that the use of the broad word is offensive because it suggests directly and immediately, paints on the mind a vivid picture of the ugly, foul or impure object: nothing is said of any further, indirect, associations connected with it, and the bad effect arises solely from the <hi rend="italic">strength</hi> or vividness of the impure or ugly impression. But in the second case the effect of the plain speaking and its associations is contrasted with those that may be produced by softening the term, or employing one which <hi rend="italic">signifies</hi> the <pb n="33"/> same thing, but suggests an entirely different and innocent set of associations. As in the instances given by Cic. in de Off. I 35. 128 <hi rend="italic">liberis dare operam.</hi> Here all the associations which would be at once suggested by the broad, obscene word, are diverted, and another set introduced, connected solely with children, as the result of the intercourse, and perfectly free from all impurity. In the one case it is the mere comparison of strength and intensity that makes the difference, in the other there is a difference of <hi rend="italic">kind.</hi> &lsquo;The fair term and the foul term it is true <hi rend="italic">mean</hi> the same thing, point to the same object, but not in respect of beauty and deformity alone simply and solely (<foreign lang="greek">ᾗ</foreign>), but besides that, there are associations suggested by which the one may be invested with a moral and the other with an immoral character, either altogether, or at all events in different degrees&rsquo;: <foreign lang="greek">ἄμφω γάρ...μᾶλλον καὶ ἧττον</foreign>. An example of these words suggestive of unpleasant associations which are willingly avoided by the well-bred and refined under the name of <foreign lang="greek">αἰσχρολογία</foreign>, is to be found in Plat. Gorg. 494 c, where Socrates is made to apologise to Callicles for shocking him by the use of terms such as <foreign lang="greek">ψωρᾶν, κνησιᾶν</foreign>. </p>
						<p>&lsquo;These are the sources from which metaphors may be taken; from things beautiful either by the voice (the sound of the word itself when uttered), or by the force or meaning&rsquo; (what it indirectly suggests: as <foreign lang="greek">δύνασθαι</foreign>, to have the power, force, virtue, when applied to words, denotes their &lsquo;value&rsquo;, in the sense of <hi rend="italic">meaning</hi> or signification, see note on I 9.36; so <foreign lang="greek">δύναμις</foreign> the subst. may of course be similarly employed), &lsquo;or by (i.e. conveyed by) the sight or any other sense&rsquo;. These terms have been already explained. <foreign lang="greek">ὄψει ἢ ἄλλῃ τινὶ αἰσθήσει</foreign> is illustrated by Victorius from Cic. de Or. III 40.161, <hi rend="italic">Nam ut odor urbanitatis, et mollitudo humanitatis, et murmur maris, et dulcedo orationis, sunt ducta a ceteris sensibus; illa vero oculorum multo acriora, quae ponunt paene in conspectu animi quae cernere et videre non possumus.</hi> </p>
						<p>&lsquo;But it is preferable (<foreign lang="greek">διαφέρει</foreign> here, to surpass, excel) to say <hi rend="italic">rose-fingered</hi> dawn, rather than <hi rend="italic">purple-fingered</hi>, or, still worse, <hi rend="italic">red-fingered.</hi>&rsquo; The latter suggests cooks' hands, or other vulgar associations. The rose on the contrary reminds one of what is agreeable to the <hi rend="italic">sight</hi>, and the <hi rend="italic">smell.</hi> Add to this from Campbell, <hi rend="italic">Phil. of Rhet.</hi>, Bk. III ch. I &sect; 1, (Vol. II p. 142, 2nd ed.), that the last of the three epithets compared is the vaguest and most general, and therefore the worst: the second better, because more special; and the first best of all, because the most particular, the red (<hi rend="italic">purple</hi> Campbell says) of the rose. He also mentions the gratification of the <hi rend="italic">two</hi> senses. </p>
					</div3>
					<div3 id="b3c2s14" type="section" n="14">
						<p>&lsquo;In the epithets also, the application of them may be made (they <pb n="34"/> may be derived, for application) from what is mean and low (morally bad in this sense), or foul and ugly, or disgraceful (another kind of badness), for instance &ldquo;matricide&rdquo;, or from what is (nobler and) better, as &ldquo;a father's avenger&rdquo;&rsquo;. The one represents the fair side of Orestes' act, the other its bad aspect. &ldquo;Locus ex Eur. Oreste 1587, <foreign lang="greek">ὁ μητροφόντης, ἐπὶ φόνῳ πράσσων φόνον</foreign> inquit Menelaus, Orestem criminans: cui se defendens respondet Orestes, <foreign lang="greek">ὁ πατρὸς ἀμύντωρ ὃν σὺ προύδωκας θανεῖν</foreign>.&rdquo; </p>

						<p>&lsquo;And Simonides, when the victor in the mule-race offered him only a small fee, refused to write (the ode on this occasion) on the plea of being offended (shocked) at the notion of &ldquo;composing an ode on halfasses,&rdquo; but when the other gave him as much as he wanted (as satisfied him), he wrote at once, &ldquo;All hail, daughters of storm-footed mares&rdquo; [&ldquo;Hurrah, for the brood of the storm-footed coursers!&rdquo;], and yet they were daughters of the asses as well&rsquo;. Dion., de Comp. Verb. c. 25 (Vol. V 201, ed. Reiske), quotes a pentameter verse, without the author's name, which contains an analogous epithet, <foreign lang="greek">κοῦραι ἐλαφροπόδων ἴχνἐ ἀειράμεναι</foreign>. On Simonides' greed of gain and miserly habits, see Aristoph. Pax 697&mdash;9. Ar. Eth. N. IV 2. ult. (<foreign lang="greek">ὁ ἐλευθέριος</foreign>) <foreign lang="greek">Σιμωνίδῃ οὐκ ἀρεσκόμενος</foreign>, which has the air of a proverbial expression for a miser. Comp. his dictum in II 16.2, on the comparative advantages of money over wisdom. The case of Simonides is referred to by Whately, <hi rend="italic">Rhet.</hi> c. III (p. 277, <hi rend="italic">Encycl. Metrop.</hi> Enc. of mental philosophy), in illustration of the &ldquo;employment of metaphors (<hi rend="italic">epithets</hi>, not metaphors) either to elevate or degrade a subject,&rdquo; of which he says in the note &ldquo;a happier instance cannot be found&rdquo; than this. </p>

					<div3 id="b3c2s15" type="section" n="15">
						<p>&lsquo;Further the same thing may be effected (as by epithets in the way of elevation or depreciation) by diminutives&rsquo;, <hi rend="italic">lit.</hi> &lsquo;diminutives are, or amount to, much the same thing as epithets&rsquo;. As epithets, so diminutives, may be applied to diminish the good or bad of a thing, according as a favourable or unfavourable view is to be taken of it. On <foreign lang="greek">ὑποκορίζεσθαι, ὑποκορισμός</foreign>, see note on I 9.29. Add Gr&auml;fenhan, <hi rend="italic">Geschichte der Klass. Philologie</hi>, I p. 459. It will be seen by the examples quoted in the note referred to, that the term includes much more than mere diminu<pb n="35"/> tives, and is extended to the expression of all coaxing, flattering, soothing, endearing phrases; and does <hi rend="italic">not</hi> (properly) include expressions of contempt, which <hi rend="italic">is</hi> however conveyed by many diminutives. The two terms are therefore by no means co-extensive: Aristotle, who has merely illustrated this form of language by <hi rend="italic">examples</hi> of diminutives, has taken them alone as the most distinctive class of words which convey by the termination endearment and contempt. The form of <hi rend="italic">endearment</hi> used in <hi rend="italic">extenuation</hi> diminishes the bad, the <hi rend="italic">contemptuous</hi> employment of them diminishes the good. </p>
						<p>There are no less than thirteen varieties of Greek diminutive terminations, which may be found in Matth. <hi rend="italic">Gr. Gr.</hi> &sect; 103. Donaldson, <hi rend="italic">Gr. Gr.</hi> &sect; 361, 3. f. aa, p. 320, gives only ten. Both of them have omitted a form <foreign lang="greek">Ἀττικίων</foreign>, which occurs in Arist. Pax 214, where the Schol. has <foreign lang="greek">καταφρονήσεως ἕνεκα</foreign>. It is to be noted that some of these diminutives in <foreign lang="greek">-διον</foreign> have the <foreign lang="greek">ι</foreign> long, though by the ordinary rule it is short. <foreign lang="greek">τᾠκι_διον</foreign>, Ar. Nub. 93. <foreign lang="greek">οὐδι_διον</foreign>, Nicom. Inc. Fr. ap. Meineke, IV. 587. <foreign lang="greek">σηπι_διον</foreign>, Arist. Fragm. et octies ap. Comic.

Fritzsche ad Arist. Ran. 1301. <foreign lang="greek">πορνίδιον</foreign> has the <foreign lang="greek">ι</foreign> long and short, Arist. Ran. 1301, and Nub. 997. The long <foreign lang="greek">ι</foreign> arises from a contraction, so that <foreign lang="greek">πορνι_διον</foreign> must be, derived from <foreign lang="greek">πορνι-ιδιον</foreign>, and is a diminutive of a diminutive. [K&uuml;hner <hi rend="italic">Gr. Gr.</hi> &sect; 330.] </p>
						<p>On Latin diminutives, Madvig, <hi rend="italic">Lat. Gr.</hi> &sect; 182. &ldquo;By means of <hi rend="italic">lus, la</hi> or <hi rend="italic">lum</hi>, and <hi rend="italic">culus, cula</hi> or <hi rend="italic">culum</hi>, are formed diminutives (<hi rend="italic">nomina diminutiva</hi>) which denote littleness, and are often used by way of endearment, commiseration, or to ridicule something insignificant, e.g. <hi rend="italic">hortulus</hi>, a little garden, <hi rend="italic">matercula</hi>, a (poor) mother, <hi rend="italic">ingeniolum</hi>, a little bit of talent.&rdquo; </p>
						<p>On English diminutives see a paper by Sir G. C. Lewis, <hi rend="italic">Phil. Mus.</hi> 1 697 seq. in Marsh's <hi rend="italic">Lect. on the Eng. Lang.</hi>, Smith's ed. p. 218; and Latham's <hi rend="italic">Eng. Lang.</hi> c. XV &sect; 337; also a paper by J. C. Hare in (Hare and Thirlwall's) <hi rend="italic">Phil. Mus.</hi> Vol. I. p. 679. These are in <hi rend="italic">kin, ling</hi>, and <hi rend="italic">et, let</hi> (from the Norman, French and Italian (E. M. C.), Marsh. <hi rend="italic">Lect.</hi> u. s. <hi rend="italic">Lect.</hi> XIV. &sect; 6). To which Latham adds <hi rend="italic">ie</hi> (Scotch), (lassie, doggie), <hi rend="italic">en</hi> (chicken, kitten), <hi rend="italic">et</hi> and <hi rend="italic">let</hi>, trumpet, lancet, pocket, owlet, brooklet, streamlet; <hi rend="italic">ock</hi> (Grimm), bullock, hillock: paddock, buttock, hummock (Lewis). &ldquo;The Greek word <foreign lang="greek">μείωσις</foreign> means diminution; <foreign lang="greek">ὑποκόρισμα</foreign> means an endearing expression. Hence we get names for the two kinds of diminutives; viz. the term <hi rend="italic">meiotic</hi> for the true diminutives, and the term <hi rend="italic">hypocoristic</hi> for the dim. of endearment.&rdquo; Grimm, <hi rend="italic">Deutsche Grammatik</hi>, III 664 (ap.

						<p>&lsquo;By diminutive I mean that which diminishes the evil and the good (which belongs to the proper meaning of a word; by the addition of a <pb n="36"/> termination), of which Aristophanes' sarcasm in the Babylonians is a specimen, where he substitutes <foreign lang="greek">χρυσιδάριον</foreign> for <foreign lang="greek">χρυσίον</foreign> (this again is diminutive of diminutive), <foreign lang="greek">ἱματιδάριον</foreign> for <foreign lang="greek">ἱμάτιον, λοιδορημάτιον</foreign> for <foreign lang="greek">λοιδορία</foreign>, and <foreign lang="greek">νοσημάτιον</foreign>&rsquo; (Fritzsche, ap. Meineke l. c., by a very probable conj., reads <foreign lang="greek">νοημάτιον</foreign>, which is certainly much more germane to the matter). &lsquo;We must, however, be very careful (in the use of this figure), and be on our guard against exaggeration in both&rsquo; (in the employment of <foreign lang="greek">ἐπίθετα</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">ὑποκορισμός</foreign>). On these diminutives of Aristophanes, Meineke, Fragm. Babyl. XXX. <hi rend="italic">Fr. Comic.

					<p>From the graces and excellences of style we now pass on to some of its defects. These are comprehended under the term <foreign lang="greek">ψυχρά</foreign>, &lsquo;faults of taste&rsquo;, expressions stale and cold, flat, lifeless, opposed to <foreign lang="greek">πρόσφατα</foreign> &lsquo;fresh&rsquo;. The import and origin of this word, as applied to style, are illustrated in Introd. pp. 286, 7. The faults lie mostly in some kind of exaggeration, or turgid and bombastic phraseology, the error of excess. Add to the examples there given, Dem. de Cor. &sect; 256, de F. L. &sect; 207, <foreign lang="greek">τὸ ψυχρὸν τοῦτο ὄνομα</foreign> (the name of <foreign lang="greek">εὐεργέτης</foreign> applied to Philip). </p>
					<p>Demetrius, <foreign lang="greek">περὶ ἑρμηνείας</foreign> &sect; 116, refers (in his chapter <foreign lang="greek">περὶ ψυχροῦ τοῦ ἀντικειμένου τῷ μεγαλοπρεπεῖ</foreign>) to this division with the author's name. All the details are omitted, and only <hi rend="italic">one</hi> of the examples, the <foreign lang="greek">ὑγρὸν ἰδρῶτα</foreign> in &sect; 3, is given.

						<p>&lsquo;Faults of taste are shewn (are made to appear; arise, grow) in four points of style or language; first in compound words, instances of which are Lycophron's &lsquo;many-visaged heaven&rsquo;, his &lsquo;vast-topped earth&rsquo;, and his &lsquo;narrow-passaged shore&rsquo;. </p>
						<p>On <foreign lang="greek">διπλᾶ ὀνόματα</foreign>, see Introd. p. 287. All the compound words mentioned are words compounded of two <hi rend="italic">significant</hi> elements, <foreign lang="greek">ὀνόματα σημαίνοντα</foreign>, Poet. XXI. 1, 2, i.e. of words which have an independent sense of their own; opposed to such as are only significant in combination with others, as prepositions, conjunctions, particles. </p>
						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">πολυπρόσωπον οὐρανόν</lemma>] &ldquo;quod plurimam variamque faciem habeat ob sidera ipsa, nisi fallor.&rdquo; Victorius. Compare Plato's famous epigram: <foreign lang="greek">ἀστέρας εἰσαθρεῖς ἀστὴρ ἐμός· εἴθε γενοίμην οὐρανός, ὡς πολλοῖς ὄμμασιν εἴς σε βλέπω</foreign>. Anthol. <foreign lang="greek">Πλάτωνος</foreign>, I (Vol. I. p. 102, ed. Jac.), Bergk, <hi rend="italic">Plat. Epigr.</hi> 14, <hi rend="italic">Lyr. Gr.</hi> p. 445. [Anthol. Gr. VII 669]. </p>
						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">μεγαλοκορίφου] κορυφή</lemma> is a <hi rend="italic">mountain-top.</hi> To one who lived in Greece and knew nothing beyond it, the Earth might well seem to be covered with vast summits. <pb n="37"/> </p>
						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ἀκτὴν στενοπόρον</lemma>] also belongs to the mountainous character of Greece. The cliffs come down precipitously to the very edge of the sea (in which there are <hi rend="italic">no tides</hi>), leaving but a narrow passage for horseman or foot-passenger. The word is used appropriately enough by the <hi rend="italic">poet</hi> Aeschylus, P. V. 729, and Eur. Iph. Aul. 1497; also by Herod. VII 211. </p>
						<p>[Blass, in his brief notice of Lycophron, <hi rend="italic">die Attische Beredsamkeit</hi>, II p. 235, while conjecturing that several of the phrases here quoted must have come from a panegyric in glorification of Athens and her heroes, and of Theseus in particular, is led by the Sophist's application of <foreign lang="greek">πέλωρον ἄνδρα</foreign> to Xerxes in &sect; 2, to refer <foreign lang="greek">ἀκτὴν στενοπόρον</foreign> to the Hellespont. It would be more reasonable, however, to take the hint supplied by his allusion to Sciron in the same section, and explain it of the narrow path which runs like a cornice along the precipitous sides of the cliffs of Sciron on the coast of Megara (Eur. Hippol. 1208, <foreign lang="greek">Σκείρωνος ἀκτάς</foreign>, Strabo IX p. 391, <foreign lang="greek">αἱ Σκειρωνίδες πέτραι πάροδον οὐκ ἀπολείπονται πρὸς θαλάττη·ͅ ὑπὲρ αὐτῶν δ’  ἐστὶν ἡ ὁδὸς ἡ ἐπὶ Μεγάρων</foreign>, and Pausanias I 44 &sect; 6 (Bekker), <foreign lang="greek">τὴν ὀνομαζομένην ἀπὸ Σκίρωνος</foreign> (<foreign lang="greek">ὀδὸν</foreign>) <foreign lang="greek">Σκίρων πρῶτος ἐποίησεν ἀνδράσιν ὁδεύειν εὐζώνοις</foreign>. Hadrian (as Pausanias adds) made this narrow ledge <foreign lang="greek">εὐρυχωρῆ</foreign>, but the cliff and its pathway have since once more become an <foreign lang="greek">ἀκτὴ στενοπόρος</foreign>, which is described by Leake (<hi rend="italic">Northern Greece</hi>, II 414) as &lsquo;only practicable by foot-passengers&rsquo;.] </p>
						<p>On Lycophron the Sophist, see <hi rend="italic">Camb. Journ. of Classical and Sacred Phil.</hi> No. v, Vol. II. p. 141 seq. Not to be confounded with Lycophron the tragic poet, the author of Cassandra, who lived at Alexandria in the reign of Ptolemy Philadelphus, towards the middle of the third cent. B.C. </p>
						<p>&lsquo;And the name given by Gorgias, &ldquo;beggar-witted or pauper-witted flatterer&rdquo;&rsquo;. <foreign lang="greek">πτωχόμουσος κόλαξ</foreign>, as Victorius understands it, <hi rend="italic">inops ingenium.</hi> Or perhaps rather one who prostitutes his literature and intellectual accomplishments to flattery and sycophancy to make a living by them, &lsquo;making his Muse a beggar.&rsquo; [&ldquo;This can hardly mean &lsquo;arm an dichterischer Begabung,&rsquo; as Rost and Palm explain. Liddell and Scott give with greater probability &ldquo;living (or rather starving) by his wits.&rdquo; It might also mean, &ldquo;one whom poverty inspires&rdquo; (cui ingeni largitor Venter). Wit and poverty are the hackneyed attributes of the Greek parasite, and in a comic poet the epithet would probably have been thought happy. A similar compound, <foreign lang="greek">πτωχαλάζων</foreign>, is quoted from Phrynichus com. (Meineke, <hi rend="italic">C. G.</hi> II p. 582).&rdquo; Thompson's ed. of the Gorgias, p. 179 note.] </p>
						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ἐπιορκήσαντας καὶ κατευορκήσαντας</lemma>] &lsquo;forsworn, and oath-observing&rsquo;. The objection here is to <foreign lang="greek">κατευορκήσαντας</foreign>, in which the <foreign lang="greek">κατά</foreign> is superfluous. All that Gorgias meant might have been equally well expressed by the <hi rend="italic">simple</hi> <foreign lang="greek">εὐορκεῖν</foreign> &lsquo;to keep one's oath&rsquo;; or rather the simple opposition of false and true, which he has <hi rend="italic">exaggerated</hi> into two long words. <foreign lang="greek">εὐορκεῖν</foreign>, though itself a compound, seems to be regarded here as a single word. The Schol. has on this, <foreign lang="greek">καὶ τὸ κατευορκῆσαι λέγεται ἐπὶ ἀληθῶς ὀμόσαντος· οὐχ ἁρμόζει δὲ ἡ λέξις αὕτη ῥηθῆναι ἐπὶ τοῦ ἁπλῶς</foreign> <pb n="38"/> <foreign lang="greek">εἰπόντος τὸ ἀληθές, οἷον ὅτι ὑπὲρ γῆν ὄντος τοῦ ἡλίου ἡμέρα ἐστίν</foreign>, i. e. this is like expounding &lsquo;it is day&rsquo; into the longer and more pompous phrase &lsquo;the sun is above the earth.&rsquo; </p>
						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">μένους μὲν τὴν ψυχὴν πληρουμένην πυρίχρων δὲ τὴν ὄψιν γιγνομένην</lemma>] &lsquo;And Alcidamas' phrases, &ldquo;His soul saturated with wrath, and his face growing the colour of fire&rdquo; (fire-coloured)&rsquo;. This, as I have noted in the account of him in <hi rend="italic">Camb. Journ. of Cl. and Sacred Phil.</hi> No. IX, Vol. III, p. 266, is an exemplification of three of the new figures which Gorgias, his master, had recently introduced into Rhetoric, <foreign lang="greek">ἀντίθεσις, παρίσωσις</foreign> or <foreign lang="greek">ἰσόκωλον</foreign>, and <foreign lang="greek">ὁμοιοτέλευτον</foreign>, on which see Ib. No. VII, III 69&mdash;72. The <foreign lang="greek">ψυχρόν</foreign> objected to is of course the <foreign lang="greek">διπλοῦν ὄνομα, πυρίχρων</foreign> [&lsquo;flame-flushed&rsquo;]. </p>
						<p>&lsquo;And &ldquo;end-fulfilling deemed he would be their zeal&rdquo;, and &ldquo;end-fulfilling established he the persuasion of his words&rdquo;, and &ldquo;dark-blue-coloured the sea's foundation&rdquo;. (<foreign lang="greek">κυάνεος</foreign> is indigo blue, also dark in general)&mdash;&lsquo;for all these have a poetical character arising from (due to) the doubling&rsquo;. </p>
						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">τελεσφόρος</lemma> may be translated by Shakespeare's &ldquo;thought-executing&rdquo; fires; but that <hi rend="italic">is</hi> poetry [<hi rend="italic">King Lear</hi> III. 2.4.&mdash;<foreign lang="greek">τελεσφόρος</foreign> became commoner in <hi rend="italic">later</hi> Greek prose, as remarked by Lobeck, <hi rend="italic">Phrynichus</hi>, p. 673 (referred to by Vahlen, <hi rend="italic">der Rhetor Alkidamas</hi>, p. 491 <hi rend="italic">infra</hi>]. </p>
						<p>An account of Alcidamas will be found in <hi rend="italic">Camb.

						<p>On the second defect of rhetorical style, <foreign lang="greek">γλῶτται</foreign>, see Introd. p. 288. </p>
						<p>&lsquo;Now this is one cause (of <foreign lang="greek">ψυχρότης</foreign>); another is the employment of obscure and unintelligible words. As Lycophron calls Xerxes a &ldquo;hugeous&rdquo; man, and Sciron&rsquo; (the famous robber who gave name to the Scironian rocks; put to death by Theseus, after Hercules the greatest eradicator of nuisances from the land of Attica) &lsquo;a &ldquo;bale&rdquo; of a man&rsquo;. </p>
						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">γλώτταις</lemma>] Whether those which have never been much in use, unusual; or those which have gone out of use, obsolete or archaic; or those which belong to a foreign language or dialect.

						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">πέλωρον</lemma>] This word frequent in Hom. and Hes. under the forms <foreign lang="greek">πέλωρ, πέλωρος</foreign> (subst.), <foreign lang="greek">πέλωρος</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">πελώριος</foreign> (adj.); <foreign lang="greek">πελώριος</foreign> twice in Aesch. <pb n="39"/> and once in Eurip. Iph. T., had it seems become obsolete in Arist.'s time. Comp. <hi rend="italic">infra</hi> 7 &sect; 11. </p>
						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">σίννις ἀνήρ</lemma>] If <foreign lang="greek">σίννις</foreign> stands for the actual robber, <foreign lang="greek">ὁ Πιτυοκάμπτης</foreign>, rival and contemporary of Procrustes, and Sciron, all of whom Theseus disposed of, he may be translated a &ldquo;Turpin-man:&rdquo; but the word is also used to represent the &ldquo;incarnation of all mischief and destructive agency&rdquo; &mdash;see Monk on Eur. Hippol. 981, and the authors cited; comp. the old poetical words <foreign lang="greek">σίνεσθαι, σίνος</foreign>, (<foreign lang="greek">σίντης</foreign> of the great robber and ravager, the mischievous, destructive lion, Hom. Il. XX 165,) and <foreign lang="greek">σίνις</foreign>. Both <foreign lang="greek">σίνος</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">σίνις</foreign> occur in Aeschylus in the abstract sense of mischief or destruction, and if <foreign lang="greek">σίννις</foreign> is to be so understood here, as I rather think it should, <hi rend="italic">bale</hi>, an old English word of similar import, may serve to express it. [Suidas s. v. <foreign lang="greek">Σίνις· ὄνομα λῃστοῦ βλαπτικοῦ</foreign>.] </p>
						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ἄθυρμα τῇ ποιήσει</lemma>] &lsquo;And Alcidamas &ldquo;<hi rend="italic">toys</hi> to poetry&rdquo;&rsquo;. The rest of the phrase is supplied below &sect; 4, &ldquo;to apply to or introduce <hi rend="italic">toys</hi> in poetry&rdquo;. <foreign lang="greek">ἄθυρμα</foreign> is a childish amusement, <foreign lang="greek">ἀθύρειν</foreign> to sport like a child, of a child's sport or pastime. So employed by Homer, Pindar, Apoll. Rhod., Anthol. (<hi rend="italic">quinquies</hi>), Euripides (in his Auge, Fragm. VIII Wagner, VI Dindorf) <foreign lang="greek">νηπίοις ἀθύρμασιν</foreign>, and by Plato in the solemn semi-poetical Leges, VII 796 B. See Donaldson on Pind. Nem. III 44, <foreign lang="greek">παῖς ἐὼν ἄθυρε</foreign>, also Meineke ad Fragm. Crat. <foreign lang="greek">Ὀδυσσῆς</foreign>, XVI; Suidas <foreign lang="greek">ἄθυρμα, παίγνιον</foreign>. It seems from this that &lsquo;toy&rsquo; is the corresponding English word; which is actually used by Spenser in the same more general sense of &lsquo;a childish sport or amusement,&rsquo; and <hi rend="italic">in this sense</hi> is with us obsolete. <hi rend="italic">Faery Queen</hi>, Bk. I. Cant. 6, 28 &ldquo;To dally thus with death is no fit <hi rend="italic">toy</hi>, Go, find some other play-fellowes, mine own sweet boy.&rdquo; &lsquo;Gawd&rsquo; is another word now obsolete that might represent it. </p>

VI 59, <foreign lang="greek">οὐκ ἤρθη νοῦν ἐπ’  ἀτασθαλίην</foreign>. [&lsquo;Retchlessness,&rsquo; for recklessness, is similarly an unfamiliar word with ourselves, and may serve as an illustration, if not a rendering of this use of <foreign lang="greek">ἀτασθαλία</foreign>.] </p>

The <foreign lang="greek">γλῶττα</foreign> here is <foreign lang="greek">τεθηγμένον</foreign>, a not very rare, but usually poetical, metaphor for exasperated, excited, provoked, irritated; <hi rend="italic">sharpened</hi> like a knife or tool, or an animal's teeth. Examples from the tragic poets are supplied by Valck. on Eur. Hippol. 689, <foreign lang="greek">ὀργῇ συντεθηγμένος φρένας</foreign>: it is opposed to <foreign lang="greek">ἀμβλύνειν</foreign> as Aesch.

Lat. <hi rend="italic">acuere.</hi> [Vahlen, <hi rend="italic">der Rhetor Alkidamas</hi> p. 492, notes that <pb n="40"/> its repeated use by Xenophon need not prevent us from regarding this use of <foreign lang="greek">θήγειν</foreign> in prose as a kind of provincialism; it appears among the <foreign lang="greek">γλῶτται κατὰ πόλεις</foreign> in Bekker's <hi rend="italic">Anecdota</hi>, <foreign lang="greek">Ἀρκάδων ἄορ ξίφος. θήγει ἀκονᾷ</foreign>.] </p>
					</div3>
					<div3 id="b3c3s3" type="section" n="3">
						<p>&lsquo;The third vice of style lies in the misuse of &ldquo;epithets&rdquo;, that is, in introducing them either too long, or out of season (out of <hi rend="italic">place, we</hi> say), or too frequent (numerous); for in poetry it is suitable enough to say &ldquo;white milk&rdquo; (a Homeric epithet of course; as red wine, fair women, &amp;c. in ballad poetry), but in prose it is not only less appropriate, but also, if they be employed to satiety (excess), they convict (detect, expose, the <hi rend="italic">art</hi> of the composition) and make it plain that it is poetry: for, to be sure, it must be used; for it varies the customary style and gives a foreign air to the language&rsquo;. </p>
						<p>On <foreign lang="greek">ἐπίθετα</foreign> see Introd. p. 289. The over-long &lsquo;epithets&rsquo; are illustrated by those of Aeschylus in Tragedy, and Aristophanes in Comedy&mdash;who sometimes strings together an entire line of epithets, as <foreign lang="greek">ἀρχαιομελισιδωνιφρυνιχήρατα</foreign>, of Phrynichus' <foreign lang="greek">μέλη</foreign> [Vesp. 220]. Such epithets are of course most inappropriate to prose. The excessive length may also be shewn in the &lsquo;descriptive additions&rsquo; to a substantive, which often takes the place of a regular <hi rend="italic">epithet.</hi> </p>
						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">δεῖ γε χρῆσθαι αὐτῇ</lemma>] i. e. to a limited extent; taking care at the same time that the poetical character of the language be not <hi rend="italic">marked</hi> and <hi rend="italic">apparent</hi> (reading <foreign lang="greek">αὐτῇ</foreign> the <hi rend="italic">vulgata lectio</hi> retained by Bekker). Spengel with A^{c} <foreign lang="greek">αὐτῷ</foreign>: Victorius and Vater <foreign lang="greek">αὐτοῖς</foreign>; but the <hi rend="italic">variation of the customary language</hi> is far more applicable to <hi rend="italic">poetical usages</hi> than to <hi rend="italic">epithets:</hi> in fact I doubt whether <foreign lang="greek">ἐξαλλάττει</foreign> could be applied to <foreign lang="greek">ἐπίθετα</foreign> with any satisfactory meaning). </p>
						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ἐξαλλάττει</lemma>] <hi rend="italic">supra</hi> c. 2 &sect; 2, note, and &sect; 5. <foreign lang="greek">ξενικὴν τὴν λέξιν</foreign>] <hi rend="italic">supra</hi> c. 2 &sect; 3. </p>
						<p>&lsquo;But the mean should always be our aim, for (the reverse of moderation, excess) does more mischief than careless, random, speaking, (over-doing it, exaggeration, is worse than entire carelessness, taking no pains at all): for the one no doubt wants the good, but the other (<hi rend="italic">has</hi>) the bad (the defect in the one case is negative, the mere absence of special excellence, in the other it is positive). And this is why Alcidamas' (epithets) appear tasteless; because he employs them, not as the mere seasoning but as the actual meat (<hi rend="italic">pi&egrave;ce de r&eacute;sistance</hi>, the substance, not the mere adjunct or appendage); so frequent, and unduly long (<foreign lang="greek">μείζοσι τοῦ δεόντος</foreign>, <hi rend="italic">too</hi> long) and conspicuous are they&rsquo;. Victorius is doubtless right in his opinion that these three words are a repetition in slightly altered terms of the three views of epithets at the commencement of the section; <hi rend="italic">unseasonableness</hi>, the importunity with which they engross the attention, is now represented by the conspicuousness or <pb n="41"/> undue prominence which produces the same effect. A fair specimen of this pompous inflated writing, in epithet and metaphor, is given in Auctor. ad Heren. IV 10. 15, <hi rend="italic">nam qui perduellionibus venditat patriam non satis supplicii dederit si praeceps in Neptunias depulsus erit lacunas. Paeniteat igitur istum qui montes belli fabricatus est, campos sustulit pacis.</hi> </p>
						<p>[<foreign lang="greek">ἐπιδήλοις</foreign>, &lsquo;obtrusive&rsquo;, &lsquo;glaring&rsquo;. Bernays proposes <foreign lang="greek">ἐπὶ δήλοις</foreign>, apparently without due cause, though Vahlen quotes it with approval.] </p>
						<p>[The little that is left of Alcidamas seems to justify Aristotle's strictures on his want of taste in the use of epithets: e.g. <foreign lang="greek">περὶ σοφιστῶν,  6, ἀντίτυπος καὶ προσάντης ἡ τῶν χαλεπωτέρων ἐπιμέλεια,  7, ὁ ποδώκης δρομεύς,  16, εὐλύτῳ τῆς ψυχῆς ἀγχινοίᾳ χρώμενον ὑγρῶς καὶ φιλανθρώπως μεταχειρίζεσθαι τοὺς λόγους,  17, ἡ γραφὴ...ἄπορον καὶ δεσμῶτιν τὴν ψυχὴν καθίστησι καὶ τῆς ἐν τοῖς αὐτοσχεδαστικοῖς εὐροίας ἁπάσης ἐπίπροσθεν γίγνεται</foreign>, (where for <foreign lang="greek">εὐροίας</foreign> we should surely read <foreign lang="greek">εὐπορίας</foreign> which is a suitable contrast to <foreign lang="greek">ἄπορον</foreign> and is supported by &sect; 26, <foreign lang="greek">τοῖς αὐτομάτοις εὐπορήμασιν ἐμποδών ἐστιν</foreign>, and by the fact that <foreign lang="greek">εὐπορία, εὔπορος, ἀπορία</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">ἄπορος</foreign> occur at least ten times in the thirty-five sections of the rhetorician's diatribe, e. g. &sect; 34, which is also an instance of the superabundance of epithets here criticised; <foreign lang="greek">τὴν γνώμην εὔλυτον καὶ τὴν μνήμην εὔπορον καὶ τὴν λήθην ἄδηλον</foreign>).

In illustration of this view, he quotes a fragment of Diogenes Laertius, VIII 2. 56, where <foreign lang="greek">Ἀλκίδαμας ἐν τῷ Φυσίκῳ</foreign> says of Empedocles,&rsquo; <foreign lang="greek">Αναξαγόρου διακοῦσαι καὶ Πυθαγόρου· καὶ τοῦ μὲν τὴν σεμνότητα ζηλῶσαι τοῦ τε βίου καὶ τοῦ σχήματος, τοῦ δὲ τὴν φυσιολογίαν</foreign>.&mdash;In Stobaeus, 120. 3, the quotation of two lines of Theognis <foreign lang="greek">ἐκ τοῦ Ἀλκιδάμαντος Μουσείου</foreign> shews that as a title of a book (whatever its exact meaning may be) the term is not so modern as might be supposed. (Compare Blass, <hi rend="italic">die Attische Beredsamkeit</hi> II 322, note).] </p>
						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ἀντίμιμονἐπιθυμίαν] ἀντίμιμος</lemma> &lsquo;corresponding by, in the way of, imitation&rsquo;, as <foreign lang="greek">ἀντίμορφος</foreign> &lsquo;corresponding in form&rsquo;, <foreign lang="greek">ἀντίτυπος</foreign> &lsquo;stroke answering stroke&rsquo;, <foreign lang="greek">ἀντίστροφος</foreign> of an &lsquo;answering wheel&rsquo; of a chorus. Aristoph. Thesm. 18, <foreign lang="greek">ὄφθαλμον ἀντίμιμον ἡλίου τροχῷ</foreign>. Thuc. VII 67, <foreign lang="greek">ἀντιμίμησις</foreign>. <pb n="43"/> From the passage of Aristoph. it seems that this word, like <foreign lang="greek">ἀντίστροφος</foreign>, should have after it a dative of the object to which it answers; what that object was in Alcidamas' declamation Aristotle has not informed us. </p>
						<p>&lsquo;And this is at the same time a compound word and an epithet, so that it becomes quite a poem (a mere bit of poetry: plain prose is turned by this inflated style into poetry)&rsquo;. </p>
						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ἔξεδρος</lemma>, from the analogy of <foreign lang="greek">ἔκτοπος, ἐκτόπιος</foreign>, and the actual use of the word&mdash;as <foreign lang="greek">ἔξεδρον χώραν ἔχειν</foreign>, of birds of omen in an unlucky quarter of the heavens, Arist. Av. 275; <foreign lang="greek">ἔξεδροι φρενῶν λόγοι</foreign> &lsquo;words beside the seat of the wits&rsquo;, Eur. Hippol. 985, <foreign lang="greek">οὐκ ἔξεδρος, ἀλλ’  ἔντοπος ἁνήρ</foreign>, Soph. Phil. 212&mdash;must mean &lsquo;out of its proper seat or place&rsquo;, &lsquo;abroad&rsquo;; and hence as an exaggeration of <hi rend="italic">excess</hi>, &lsquo;extravagant&rsquo;, as translated. </p>
						<p>On these extracts from Alcidamas Victorius remarks, &ldquo;Cum autem haec omnia a mediis quibusdam orationibus sumpserit, ut vitiosae tantum locutionis exemplum sint, non est quod miremur aut plenam sententiam in nonnullis non esse; aut desiderari, ut in hac, verbum unde casus nominum regantur.&rdquo; </p>
						<p>&lsquo;And so this poetical diction by its unsuitableness introduces absurdity and tastelessness into their composition, and obscurity which is due to the verbiage: for whenever (a speaker or writer) accumulates words (throws a heap of them) upon one already informed (already acquainted with his meaning), he destroys (breaks up, dissolves, effaces) all perspicuity (distinctness) by the cloud (or darkness, obscurity) in which he involves his meaning&rsquo; (<hi rend="italic">lit.</hi> which he brings <hi rend="italic">over</hi> it; <foreign lang="greek">ἐπισκοτεῖν τῇ κρίσει</foreign>, I 1. 7, see note: <hi rend="italic">to over-cloud</hi>, over-shadow, obscure). </p>
						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ἀδολεσχίαν</lemma>] the accumulation of unnecessary or unmeaning words: <foreign lang="greek">ἀδολεσχία</foreign> is idle, empty, chatter, prating.

						<p>&lsquo;And people in general, use their compound words (<foreign lang="greek">τοῖς</foreign>, those that they <hi rend="italic">do</hi> use) when it (what they want to express) is nameless (has no single word to represent it) and the word is easily put together (the combination is easily made), as <foreign lang="greek">χρονοτριβεῖν</foreign>: but if this be carried too far <pb n="44"/> (overdone), it (the result) becomes absolutely poetical. And this is why compound words are most serviceable to the dithyrambic poets&mdash;<foreign lang="greek">τῶν δ’  ὀνομάτων τὰ μὲν διπλᾶ μάλιστα ἁρμόττει τοῖς διθυράμβοις</foreign>, Poet. XXII 18&mdash; for these are noisy, &ldquo;full of sound and fury&rdquo;; full of pompous, highsounding phrases&rsquo; (on <foreign lang="greek">ψόφος</foreign> see III 2. 13); &lsquo;and obsolete or unusual, to Epic poets, for language of this kind has a stately (majestic, dignified, proud, solemn, and scornful or disdainful) air; and metaphor to writers in iambics, for these they (i.e. the tragic poets) now-a-days&mdash;since they have quitted the tetrameter&mdash;employ, as has been already stated. III 1. 9 comp. <hi rend="italic">infra</hi> 8.4, and Poet. IV 18. The <hi rend="italic">reason</hi>, conveyed by <foreign lang="greek">γάρ</foreign>, is this: I say iambics, not tetrameters, <hi rend="italic">because</hi> now-a-days, &amp;c. </p>
						<p>[<foreign lang="greek">χρονοτριβεῖν</foreign>. Compare our &lsquo;pastime,&rsquo; which is also a <foreign lang="greek">λόγος εὐσύνθετος</foreign>. So in Daniel's <hi rend="italic">Ulysses and Siren</hi>, &ldquo;<hi rend="italic">Delicious nymph! suppose there were No honour or report, Yet manliness would scorn to</hi> wear The time <hi rend="italic">in idle sport.</hi>&rdquo; Isocr. Paneg. &sect; 41, <foreign lang="greek">ἡδίστας διατριβάς</foreign>.] </p>
						<p>On compound words, as connected with dithyrambic poetry, Demetrius, <foreign lang="greek">περὶ ἑρμηνείας</foreign> &sect; 91, says, <foreign lang="greek">ληπτέον δὲ καὶ σύνθετα ὀνόματα, οὐ τὰ διθυραμβικῶς συγκείμενα, οἷον θεοτεράτους πλάνας, οὐδὲ ἄστρων δορύπορον στρατόν, ἀλλ’  ἐοικότα τοῖς ὑπὸ τῆς συνηθείας συγκειμένοις</foreign> (such as <foreign lang="greek">νομοθέται, ἀρχιτέκτονες</foreign>): comp. &sect; 78, the accumulation of metaphors will make <foreign lang="greek">διθύραμβον ἀντὶ λόγου</foreign>. </p>
						<p>The dithyramb at Athens became at and after the end of the fifth cent. the wildest, and (in point of style) most licentious and most extravagant of all the kinds of poetry. See note in Introd. on III 9, pp. 307, 8, and the reff. to Aristoph. there given; Bode, <hi rend="italic">Gesch. der Hell. dichtk.</hi> Vol. II. Pt. II. p. III seq. and 290 seq.; and M&uuml;ller, <hi rend="italic">H. G. L.</hi> s. XXX. To use words suited to a dithyrambic poet is therefore an exaggeration of the ordinary defect of the introduction into prose of poetical language. </p>

						<p>&lsquo;And further, the fourth vice of style is shewn in metaphors; for metaphors also are inappropriate, some because they are laughable&mdash; for the <hi rend="italic">comic</hi> poets also employ metaphors&mdash;others from their exaggeration of the stately (solemn) and tragic (pompous) style: if far-fetched, they are obscure&rsquo;. <foreign lang="greek">πόρρωθεν</foreign>, see on III 2. 12. &lsquo;As Gorgias, &ldquo;things (<foreign lang="greek">πράγματα</foreign>, actions, occurrences, events, business) all fresh and raw&rdquo;&rsquo;. This certainly is a good exemplification of what it is designed to illustrate: it <hi rend="italic">is</hi> obscure. It seems, however, to mean nothing more than &lsquo;recent events&rsquo;, events <hi rend="italic">fresh</hi>, and with the blood in them: the metaphor from a beast just killed. It therefore corresponds to <foreign lang="greek">πρόσφατος</foreign>, &lsquo;fresh&rsquo;, which also stands for &lsquo;recent&rsquo;. <foreign lang="greek">πρόσφατος</foreign> is specially applied to &lsquo;fresh meat&rsquo;. See Lobeck <hi rend="italic">On Phrynichus</hi>, p. 375, note: examples of <foreign lang="greek">πρόσφατος</foreign> are there given, p. 374. &lsquo;&ldquo;And these things <hi rend="italic">thou</hi> hast sown in disgrace, and reaped in misery&rdquo;. For it smells too much of poetry&rsquo;. [Both the extracts probably belong to the same context, and may perhaps be combined by rendering them thus: &lsquo;all was green and unripe (fresh and flushed with sap), and this was the crop that you sowed in shame to reap in ruin&rsquo;. <foreign lang="greek">χλωρὰ καὶ ἔναιμα</foreign> possibly refer to the green and unripe stalks of corn, with the sap still fresh in them. This assumes that <foreign lang="greek">αἷμα</foreign> can be used metaphorically of &lsquo;sap&rsquo;, both coming under the generic notion of &lsquo;vital juice&rsquo;. If so, the metaphor is a sufficiently bold one. Thompson (ed. of the Gorgias, p. 179) notes that <foreign lang="greek">ἄναιμα</foreign> (which is the reading of Q, Y^{b} and Z^{b}) is &lsquo;well supported, and cannot but be right,&rsquo; and remarks that while the metaphor of sowing and reaping is a mere commonplace, &ldquo;pallid and bloodless affairs&rdquo; would need apology even from a modern.] </p>
						<p>A metaphor, nearly resembling the first of these two, occurs in Demetrius <foreign lang="greek">περὶ ἑρμηνείας,  116, γίνεται δὲ καὶ ἐν μεταφορᾷ τὸ ψυχρόν, τρέμοντα καὶ ὠχρὰ τὰ πράγματα</foreign>. Longinus <foreign lang="greek">περὶ ὕψους 3.2, ταύτῃ καὶ τὰ τοῦ Λεοντίνου Γοργίον γελᾶται γράφοντος, Ξέρξης ὁ τῶν Περσῶν Ζεύς. καὶ γύπες ἔμψυχοι τάφοι</foreign>&rdquo; [comp. <hi rend="italic">supra</hi> I &sect; 9, on the poetical style of Gorgias]. </p>
						<p>Hermogenes also, <foreign lang="greek">περὶ ἰδεῶν Τομ. ά, περὶ σεμνότητος</foreign> 226 (p. 292, Spengel, <hi rend="italic">Rhetores Graeci</hi>, vol. II.) gives some examples of exaggerated metaphors, <foreign lang="greek">ἐκνενευρισμένοι, καὶ τὸ πεπρακὼς ἑαυτόν, καὶ τὸ λωποδυτῶν</foreign> <pb n="46"/> <foreign lang="greek">τὴν Ἑλλάδα</foreign>: and a few lines below, <foreign lang="greek">τάφους ἐμψύχους τοὺς γύπας</foreign>, but without the author's name. The objection to some of these metaphors, as the &lsquo;sowing and reaping&rsquo;, the &lsquo;selling oneself&rsquo;, and above all, Alcidamas' &lsquo;mirror of human life&rsquo;, seems to shew a change of taste from ancient to modern criticism. <hi rend="italic">We</hi> certainly should object to none of these; and the &lsquo;mirror&rsquo; in particular has become one of the commonest metaphors in our language. The &lsquo;sowing and reaping&rsquo; appears in Plato, Phaedr. 260 C (see Thompson's note), and Aesch. Pers. 821. In Cic. de Orat. II 65. 261 (without comment), <hi rend="italic">ut sementem feceris ita metes.</hi> I Ep. ad Cor. xv. 42&mdash;4. Ep. ad Gal. vi. 7 (and Lightfoot ad loc.). &ldquo;They that sow in tears shall reap in joy: he that now goeth forth weeping, and beareth forth good seed, shall doubtless come again with joy, and bring his sheaves with him,&rdquo; Psalm cxxvi. 6, 7. Possibly the antithesis, one of Gorgias' new inventions, may have helped to offend Aristotle's tastes, and it is the effect of the whole phrase, and not of the harmless metaphor alone, that has unconsciously provoked his disapprobation: yet the same occurs in the simple psalm. </p>
						<p>[<foreign lang="greek">καλὸν ἀνθρωπίνου βίου κάτοπτρον</foreign>. Alcidamas elsewhere uses this metaphor from a mirror, in the form of a <hi rend="italic">simile</hi>, <foreign lang="greek">περὶ σοφίστων,  32, εἰς δὲ τὰ γεγραμμένα κατιδόντας ὥσπερ ἐν κατόπτρῳ θεωρῆσαι τὰς τῆς ψυχῆς ἐπιδόσεις ῥᾴδιόν ἐστιν</foreign>. The present passage and those already quoted in &sect; 3 <foreign lang="greek">τοῖς τῆς ὕλης κλάδοις ἀπέκρυψεν κ.τ.λ.</foreign> (Odyss. VI 128) and <foreign lang="greek">κυανόχρων τὸ τῆς θαλάττης ἔδαφος</foreign>, probably belong to a declamation on Odysseus (or on the Odyssey); while <foreign lang="greek">τελεσφόρον τὴν πειθὼ τῶν λόγων κατέστησεν</foreign> (&sect; 1), and <foreign lang="greek">πανδήμου χάριτος δημιουργός καὶ οἰκονόμος τῆς τῶν ἀκουόντων ἡδονῆς</foreign> (&sect; 3), point with equal probability to a pamphlet on Rhetoric.] </p>
						<p>&lsquo;And as Alcidamas (follower of Gorgias), (called) philosophy a &ldquo;fortress to threaten&rdquo; (a standing menace to), the laws; and the Odyssey a &ldquo;fair mirror of human life&rdquo;; and &ldquo;introducing no such toys, or gawds, in his poetry&rdquo;&mdash;for all such things are subversive of credibility, for the reasons already stated&rsquo;. These are, that forced metaphors, and all such-like artificial graces and ornaments, make the art and the labour of composition apparent; make the speech appear studied and affected, and therefore <hi rend="italic">premeditated</hi> and unreal, and without <hi rend="italic">serious purpose:</hi> <foreign lang="greek">οὐκ εὖ κλέπτεται</foreign>: the language of genuine emotion, of earnest and real conviction, which are required for persuasion, being always simple and natural. Probably the most perfect example of art thus disguised by art is to be found in Mark Antony's speeches over Caesar's body in <hi rend="italic">Julius Caesar;</hi> and the first thing he does is to impress upon his audience the entire artlessness and unstudied simplicity of <pb n="47"/> his address: <hi rend="italic">I am no orator as Brutus is, but, as you know me all, a plain, blunt man that love my friend</hi>, &amp;c [III 2. 221]. </p>
						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ἐπιτείχισμα</lemma>] in the first extract from Alcidamas, is interpreted in this passage in the Lexicons of Rost and Palm, and Liddell and Scott&mdash;in Stephens' <hi rend="italic">Thesaurus</hi> it is quoted but <hi rend="italic">not</hi> explained&mdash;&lsquo;a bulwark or defence of the laws&rsquo;. But <foreign lang="greek">ἐπιτείχισμα</foreign> in its proper literal sense seems to be invariably used of an offensive, not defensive, fortification, to command and annoy an enemy's country, like Decelia, which, <foreign lang="greek">τῇ χώρᾳ ἐπῳκεῖτο</foreign>, Thuc. VII 27. 3 (Bekker, in Thuc. VIII 95, reads <foreign lang="greek">τείχισμα</foreign> for <foreign lang="greek">ἐπιτείχισμα</foreign>, on this account) as indeed is required by the <foreign lang="greek">ἐπί</foreign> with which it is compounded; and <hi rend="italic">philosophy</hi> may be used in the attack, as well as the defence, of established laws and institutions, whether it be understood as speculation or scientific research. </p>
						<p>&lsquo;And Gorgias' address to the swallow, when she discharged her excrement&rsquo; [rather, &lsquo;dropped her leavings&rsquo;] upon him as she flew over, is in the best style of tragic diction, (<foreign lang="greek">τὸ δὲ Γ. ἄριστα</foreign>, sc. <foreign lang="greek">εἴρηται</foreign>,) &ldquo;For shame, Philomel&rdquo;, said he. For to a bird it was no disgrace to have done it, but to a young (unmarried) lady it was. And therefore he was right in his reproach to describe (speak of) her as she <hi rend="italic">was</hi>, and not as she is'. The simplicity of all this is delightful. I could fancy Aristotle winking to his imaginary reader as he wrote the explanation, <foreign lang="greek">ὄρνιθι μὲν γάρ κ.τ.λ.</foreign>, a bird, you know, &amp;c. [The anecdote illustrates the habit of irony ascribed to Gorgias in 7 &sect; 11, <hi rend="italic">infra</hi>, <foreign lang="greek">μετ’  εἰρωνείας ὅπερ Γοργίας ἐποίει</foreign>, as noticed in Thompson's ed. of the Gorgias, p. 180.] </p>
						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">περίττωμα</lemma>] in medicine and natural history is &lsquo;a secretion&rsquo;. It occurs constantly all through Ar.'s writings on Nat. Hist. Plut. Symp. p. 727 D (Victorius), in telling the same story, uses the broad Aristophanic word: <foreign lang="greek">Γοργίας δὲ ὁ σοφιστὴς χελιδόνος ἀφείσης ἐπ’  αὐτὸν ἀπόπατον, ἀναβλέψας πρὸς αὐτήν, οὐ καλὰ ταῦτ̓, εἶπεν, ὦ Φιλομήλα</foreign>. </p>
						<p>On the transformation of Procne and Philomela authorities differ. Thucydides, II 29, referring to the story, seems to adopt Gorgias' view, and make Procne the nightingale. Ovid seems to leave the point unsettled, Metaph. VI 667 seq. But tradition in general, and English poetry in particular, have always associated Philomela with the nightingale; e.g. 'Less Philomel will deign a song. Milton's <hi rend="italic">Penseroso</hi>, 56. </p>
						<p>Victorius notices on this passage that Aristotle includes under the designation of metaphor more than is now recognised as belonging to it. The case here, he says, is a mere <hi rend="italic">hypallage</hi> or change of name. Comp. Cic. Orator c. XXVII 93, 94. <hi rend="italic">Hanc</hi> <foreign lang="greek">ὑπαλλαγήν</foreign> <hi rend="italic">rhetores, quia quasi summutantur verba pro verbis</hi>, <foreign lang="greek">μετωνυμίαν</foreign> <hi rend="italic">grammatici vocant, quod nomina</hi> <pb n="48"/> <hi rend="italic">transferuntur.

					<p>From metaphors (c. 2), and the abuse of them (c. 3), we pass on in this chapter to the simile, <foreign lang="greek">εἰκών;</foreign> which differs from the metaphor only in this, that the latter concentrates, or fuses into one, the two things or notions brought into comparison. The former separates them by the particle of comparison <foreign lang="greek">ὡς</foreign>. Thus the simile may be regarded as an expanded metaphor.

						<p>&lsquo;The simile too is a metaphor, the difference between them being slight: for when he (Homer<note anchored="yes">The words here assigned to Homer do not occur in our present text: but the substance of them is found at the beginning of the famous simile of the lion, Il.

As we have already so many times had occasion to notice, Ar. has here quoted from memory; and like all other men of very extensive reading and very retentive memory, Bacon for example, and Walter Scott, has trusted too much to his memory, not referred to his author, and consequently misquoted.

						<p>&lsquo;An example of the simile is&rsquo; (<hi rend="italic">lit.</hi> Similes are a thing like that simile which), &lsquo;that which Androtion (directed, discharged) against Idrieus, that he was like the curs when they are let loose (untied); for <hi rend="italic">they</hi> fly at you and bite, and so Idrieus was vicious (or savage) when <hi rend="italic">he</hi> was freed from his chains&rsquo;. </p>
						<p>Androtion was an Athenian orator, whose name occurs coupled with many opprobrious epithets not only in the speech delivered against him (Or. 22), but also in that against Timocrates in which he is very frequently mentioned. He was sent on an embassy with Melanopus and Glaucetes, Dem. c. Timocr. &sect;&sect; 12, 13, alibi, to Mausolus prince of Caria 377&mdash;351 B. C. Idrieus was his brother, and Androtion may have met him at his court, and there had the encounter with him which ended in the discharge of his simile. The Scholiast on Isocr. p. 4 <hi rend="italic">b</hi> 27 (ap. Sauppe, <hi rend="italic">Ind. Nom. ad Or. Att.</hi>) tells us that he was a pupil of Isocrates, and the writer of the &lsquo;Atthis&rsquo;, &ldquo;a work on the history of Attica&rdquo;, <hi rend="italic">Biographical Dictionary</hi>&mdash;which settles the question raised in that Dictionary about the identity of the orator and author&mdash;and the Scholiast adds that he was also the defendant in Demosthenes' speech <hi rend="italic">contra Androtionem.</hi> </p>
						<p>Idrieus was a prince of Caria who succeeded to the throne on the death of his brother Mausolus in 351 B.C. See Mr Bunbury's Art. in <hi rend="italic">Biogr. Dict.</hi> He is mentioned by Isocrates, Philippus &sect; 103, as <foreign lang="greek">εὐπορώτατον τῶν νῦν περὶ τὴν ἤπειρον</foreign>. This speech was published in 346 B.C. (Clinton), and therefore subsequent to his accession. It may be presumed that the imprisonment with which Androtion taunts him was due to his brother, and of course prior to his accession to the throne. He is referred to again without his name by Demosth. in the speech de Pace, &sect; 25,&mdash; this was also delivered in 346 B.C. (Clinton <hi rend="italic">F.H.</hi> II 360)&mdash;as &lsquo;the Carian&rsquo;, who had been permitted to take possession of the islands of Chios, Cos, and Rhodes. [A. Schaefer, <hi rend="italic">Dem. u. s. Zeit</hi>, I 351, 440.] </p>
						<p>&lsquo;And Theodamas' comparison of Archidamus to Euxenus&mdash;<hi rend="italic">minus</hi> his geometry, by proportion: for Euxenus also will be Archidamus <hi rend="italic">plus</hi> geometry&rsquo; (a geometrical Archidamus). Nothing is known of the three persons here mentioned. Theodamas compares Archidamus to Euxenus without his geometry; and so&mdash;by the rule of proportion, i. e. in the same proportion&mdash;will Euxenus be to Archidamus with geometry: i. e. <hi rend="italic">equal</hi>, both being alike rascals. The <hi rend="italic">proportion</hi> is that of equality. With <foreign lang="greek">ἐν τῷ ἀνάλογον</foreign> supply <foreign lang="greek">λόγῳ</foreign>, &lsquo;in the ratio, or relation, of <hi rend="italic">proportion</hi>&rsquo;. <pb n="50"/> In this we are referred to the &lsquo;proportional metaphor&rsquo;, the last and most approved of the four kinds described in Poet. XXI 7&mdash;16. Comp. Rhet. III 10. 7, where the proportional met. is illustrated at length. Victorius, who agrees in this explanation, supplies a parallel case from Diogenes Laertius, Polemo, IV 3.7, <foreign lang="greek">ἔλεγεν οὖν τὸν μὲν Ὅμηρον ἐπικὸν εἶναι Σοφοκλέα, τὸν δὲ Σοφοκλέα Ὅμηρον τραγικόν</foreign>. Theodamas has taken this common mode of comparison and applied it to the <hi rend="italic">equal worthlessness</hi> of Archidamus and Euxenus. It was probably a standing joke at Athens. The case may have been something of this kind:&mdash;Two contemptible fellows, one of them priding himself upon a little knowledge of geometry, are comparing or disputing their respective merits: &ldquo;you needn't say any more about the matter,&rdquo; says Theodamas, a bystander, who was listening much amused to the discussion, &ldquo;you are both equal, <hi rend="italic">Arcades ambo</hi>, a pair of fools, only Euxenus is a geometrical Archidamus, Archidamus an ungeometrical Euxenus.&rdquo; </p>
						<p>&lsquo;And that in Plato's Republic (V 469 D), that &ldquo;the spoilers of the dead are like <hi rend="italic">curs</hi> (<foreign lang="greek">κυνιδίοις</foreign>, contemptuous, diminutive: an improvement on <hi rend="italic">Plato</hi>, who merely says <foreign lang="greek">κυνῶν</foreign>), which bite the stones (thrown at them) without attacking, setting upon, the thrower&rdquo;&rsquo;. Aristotle, like Bacon, quoting from memory, and assuming a knowledge of the original in his readers, has left out the explanatory part of the illustration which is supplied by Plato. Victorius cites Pacuvius, ap. Nonium, in Armorum Iudicio, <hi rend="italic">Nam canis, quando est percussa lapide, non tam illum appetit, Qui se icit, quam illum eum lapidem, qui ipsa icta est, petit.</hi> </p>
						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">καὶ ἡ εἰς τὸν δῆμον</lemma>] This, which originally stood in MSS Q, Y^{b}, Z^{b}, and the early editions, <foreign lang="greek">καὶ ὡς ὁ Δημοσθένης εἰς τὸν δῆμον</foreign>, was first corrected by Victorius from MS A^{c}. </p>
						<p>&lsquo;And that (simile, understand <foreign lang="greek">εἰκών</foreign>,) (directed) against democracy, that it is like a ship-owner (or ship's captain) strong but slightly deaf&rsquo;. This again is a mere allusion to or reminder of, &lsquo;what every one must surely remember&rsquo;, Plato's celebrated illustration (Rep. VI 488 A) of the evils of democracy by the comparison of it to the undisciplined, untrained, turbulent, anarchical, crew of a ship; each of them, though utterly without qualification for the charge, ready to dispute with the captain the direction and control of the vessel. The passage is referred to by Cicero, de Off. I 25. The words quoted by Ar., few as they are, are not correct: he makes the <foreign lang="greek">ναύκληρος</foreign> the representative of the <foreign lang="greek">δῆμος</foreign>, the whole state; in Plato the <foreign lang="greek">ναύκληρος</foreign>&mdash;the ship-owner, who in this case is captain, and steers his own vessel&mdash;is the governor, or governors, of the unruly mob of citizens. </p>
						<p>&lsquo;And that (<hi rend="italic">sc.</hi> <foreign lang="greek">εἰκών</foreign>, as before) applied to the poet's measures, that they are like the bloom of youth without beauty (actual beauty of features): <pb n="51"/> for they, when their bloom has faded (worn off, when they have <hi rend="italic">lost</hi> it), and the other (the poet's measures) when they are broken up, seem utterly unlike (their former selves)&rsquo;. This also comes from Rep. X 601 B, <foreign lang="greek">ἔοικε</foreign> (<foreign lang="greek">τὰ τῶν ποιητῶν</foreign>) <foreign lang="greek">τοῖς τῶν ὡραίων προσώποις, καλῶν δὲ μὴ, οἷα γίγνεται ἰδεῖν ὅταν αὐτὰ τὸ ἄνθος προλίπῃ</foreign>. All poetry is imitation of natural objects, which are invested with certain &lsquo;colours&rsquo; by the poetical art, in which the entire interest and beauty of poetry lie. These colours resemble the bloom on a youthful face, which is merely superficial, when there is nothing corresponding underneath, no beauty of feature or solid attraction. The imitation of the objects themselves may be bad and incorrect, as the face itself may be plain; so that when the bloom, the poetical colours, the graces and ornaments, and especially the <hi rend="italic">numbers</hi>, are removed, there remains only a substratum, which may be worthless, of the direct imitation. Horace, Sat. I 4.60, has pronounced, as is wellknown, a directly contrary opinion, at least in respect of the better kind of poetry. After applying to Lucilius' verses much the same criticism as Plato does to poetry in general, he adds, <hi rend="italic">Non, ut si</hi> solvas &lsquo;<hi rend="italic">postquam discordia tetra Belli ferratos postes portasque refregit</hi>,&rsquo; <hi rend="italic">Invenias etiam disiecti membra po&lt;*&gt;tae:</hi> from Ennius. Compare Isocr. Evag. &sect; 11,  <foreign lang="greek">ἢν γάρ τις τῶν ποιημάτων τῶν εὐδοκιμούντων τὰ μὲν ὀνόματα καὶ τὰς διανοίας καταλίπῃ, τὸ δὲ μέτρον διαλύσῃ, φανήσεται πολὺ καταδεέστερα τῆς δόξης ἧς νῦν ἔχομεν περὶ αὐτῶν</foreign>. Also Rhet. III 1. 9. </p>
						<p>With the expression comp. Eth. N. X 4, 1174 <hi rend="italic">b</hi> ult. <foreign lang="greek">οἷον τοῖς ἀκμαίοις ἡ ὥρα</foreign>, pleasure is like the bloom on the <foreign lang="greek">ἐνέργεια</foreign>, the realized, active energy: illustrated by Zell's note ad loc., from Valerius Paterculus [II 29. 2], of Pompeius, <hi rend="italic">forma excellens, non ea qua flos commendatur aetatis, sed ex dignitate constanti.</hi> Youthful bloom, distinct from, and independent of, personal beauty. </p>
						<p>&lsquo;And that of Pericles against the Samians, that they are like babies (<foreign lang="greek">παιδίοις</foreign>, &lsquo;little children&rsquo;) which cry whilst they take the morsel (or sop) offered them&rsquo;. <foreign lang="greek">ψῶμος</foreign> recurs, under the form <foreign lang="greek">ψώμισμα</foreign>, in the third simile following, where it is explained. The comparison made here by Pericles of the Samians to babies, which take their food, but cry while they take it, refers to their conduct after the final reduction of the island by Pericles in 440 B. C., Thuc. I 115&mdash;117, after an eight months' contest, <foreign lang="greek">ἐξεπολιορκήθησαν ἐνάτῳ μηνί</foreign>. The sop, i.e. the nourishment, benefits, favours, they had received&mdash;from the <hi rend="italic">Athenian</hi> point of view&mdash;consisted, thinks Schrader, in their freedom, and liberation from the yoke of the Persians and the oligarchs. They nevertheless, though they accepted them, most ungratefully and unreasonably grumbled. Buhle refers to Diodor. XII 27. </p>
						<p>&lsquo;And (of Pericles again) against the Boeotians; that they are like their <pb n="52"/> own holm-oaks: for as these are cut down (knocked about or down) by themselves&rsquo; (dashed one against another by the wind; so Victorius; or &lsquo;cut down&rsquo;, split by wedges and mallets made of their own wood, like the &ldquo;struck eagle&rdquo; of Aeschylus, Waller, and Byron), &lsquo;so are the Boeotians, by their civil (or domestic) contentions&rsquo;. </p>
						<p>&lsquo;And Demosthenes compared the people&rsquo; (of the Athenian, or some other, democracy: understand <foreign lang="greek">εἴκασεν</foreign>, which is expressed in the next example) &lsquo;to the sea-sick passengers in the vessels at sea&rsquo;. Their <hi rend="italic">squeamishness</hi>, fastidiousness, nausea with the existing state of things, constant desire of change, is produced by the perpetual <hi rend="italic">agitation, fluctuation</hi> of their political condition and circumstances, the tumultuous waves of the stormy sea of civil commotion: they are sick of the present, and long for change. The Demosthenes here mentioned is, by general consent, <hi rend="italic">not</hi> the Orator; more probably the Athenian general of the Peloponnesian war in Thucydides [<hi rend="italic">sine causa</hi>, says Spengel]. </p>
						<p>The very remarkable fact that the <hi rend="italic">name</hi> of the great Orator is in all probability only once mentioned by Aristotle&mdash;II 24. 8, where Demades' condemnation of his policy is quoted&mdash;though the pair were living together for many years in the same city&mdash;is parallel to a similar silence of Bacon as to <hi rend="italic">his</hi> great contemporary Shakespeare; but still more remarkable in the former case, from the constant occasion offered to the writer on Rhetoric of illustrating his rules and topics from the practice of the first of speakers. It has been already noticed in the Introduction, pp. 45, 46, and notes, where the cases of supposed mention of or allusion to Demosthenes are collected and examined. And this omission will appear still more remarkable when it is contrasted with the nine closely printed columns of references and citations in Spengel's <hi rend="italic">Index Auctorum ad Rhetores Graecos</hi> III 312, seq. </p>
						<p>&lsquo;And Democrates' comparison of the &ldquo;orators&rdquo; to the nurses who themselves swallow the morsel (which they have previously chewed and softened for the baby), and smear (or slobber over) the babies with the spittle (that they have used in the process)&rsquo;. This is the case of the lawyer and the oyster in the caricature; the legal practitioner swallows the savoury contents, and presents the rival claimants with a shell apiece; so the public speakers swallow the substantial profit themselves, and besmear the audience with their unctuous flattery. Comp. Ar. Eq. 715, (<foreign lang="greek">Κλέων</foreign>) <foreign lang="greek">ἐπίσταμαι γὰρ αὐτὸν</foreign> (<foreign lang="greek">τὸν δῆμον</foreign>, represented as a toothless old man that must be fed like a baby) <foreign lang="greek">οἷς ψωμίζεται·</foreign> (<foreign lang="greek">Ἀλλαντοπώλης</foreign>) <foreign lang="greek">κᾆθ’  ὥσπερ αἱ τιτθαί γε σιτίζεις κακῶς· μασώμενος γὰρ τῷ μὲν ὀλίγον ἐντίθης, αὐτὸς δ̓</foreign> <pb n="53"/> <foreign lang="greek">ἐκείνου τριπλάσιον κατέσπακας</foreign>. Democrates, the author of this saying, seems, from a passage of Plutarch (in Vict.), Pol. Praec. 803 D, to have been notorious for biting and offensive sayings, <foreign lang="greek">τὸ λυποῦν ἀκαίρως τοὺς ἀκούοντας</foreign>: two of them are quoted. Two persons of this name are mentioned by the Orators. One, son of Sophilus, of the deme of Phlya, in a list of the ambassadors sent to Philip in 347 B.C., after the fall of Olynthus (in the spurious <foreign lang="greek">ψήφισμα</foreign>, Demosth. de Cor. &sect; 29, see Dissen), and again in another questionable <foreign lang="greek">ψήφισμα</foreign>, Dem. de Cor. &sect; 187, purporting to be Demosthenes' decree for the appointment of ambassadors to Thebes and the other Greek states, to negotiate an alliance, and arrest the progress of Philip, June, B. C. 338, Clinton, <hi rend="italic">Fasti Hellenici, sub anno.</hi> The other, of Aphidna, Isaeus, <foreign lang="greek">περὶ τοῦ Φιλοκτήμονος κλήρου</foreign>, &sect; 22, and Aesch. de F. L. &sect; 17. Nothing more seems to be known of either of them. The two are confounded in the article of Smith's <hi rend="italic">Biographical Dictionary</hi>, Democrates No. 1; and the saying here quoted is styled &ldquo;a fragment of one of his orations.&rdquo; </p>
						<p>&lsquo;And Antisthenes' comparison of Cephisodotus the thin (slight, lean) to frankincense, because he gives pleasure by wasting away&rsquo;. <foreign lang="greek">ὁ λεπτός</foreign> seems to have been a sobriquet of Cephisodotus; and may also indicate a second point of resemblance between him and frankincense, namely his slight, vaporous, unsubstantial nature. Buhle quotes in illustration the German proverb, <hi rend="italic">die Juden nehmen sich nirgend besser aus als am Galgen.</hi> <foreign lang="greek">Ὅτι ἀπολλύμενος εὐφραίνει</foreign> means that that was the <hi rend="italic">only</hi> enjoyment that was to be got out of him: all the rest of him, his properties, qualities, character, was anything but enjoyable, bad and vicious. On <foreign lang="greek">λεπτός</foreign> contrasted with <foreign lang="greek">παχύς</foreign>, and men distinguished by this personal peculiarity, Athenaeus has three chapters, XII 75&mdash;77, p. 551, seq. </p>
						<p>Antisthenes is most likely the Cynic philosopher, who outlived the battle of Leuctra, 371 B. C., Clinton, <hi rend="italic">Fasti Hellenici, sub anno</hi> 365, and was therefore contemporary with Cephisodotus. He, like his successor, Diogenes, had a habit of bitter sarcasm, of which the saying here quoted is a fair specimen. It is truly a bitter jest. See the account of him in Cotton's art. in Smith's <hi rend="italic">Biogr. Dict.</hi> Vol. I, p. 208 <hi rend="italic">a.</hi> A long list of his sayings is given by Diog. Laert. in his life, VI I, some of which are caustic enough. Mr. Grote, in his account of Antisthenes, <hi rend="italic">Plato</hi>, III, p. 504, seq., has not specified this cynical feature in his character. [Blass, <hi rend="italic">die Attische Beredsamkeit</hi>, II 304&mdash;316.] </p>
						<p>Cephisodotus, <foreign lang="greek">ἐκ Κεραμέων</foreign>. Distinguished by Sauppe (<hi rend="italic">Ind. Nom. ad Or. Att.</hi> III, p. 77) from the general of that name, mentioned by Demosth. c. Aristocr. &sect;&sect; 153, 156, 163, 167, as sent (about 359 B. C.) to cooperate with Charidemus in the Hellespont and Chersonese, and elsewhere; by Aesch. c. Ctes. &sect; 51, seq.; by Suidas and Harpocration. Cephis. <foreign lang="greek">ἐκ Κεραμέων</foreign>, the orator, is referred to in Dem. c. Lept. &sect; 146, together with Leodamas, Aristophon, and Deinias, as one of the best speakers of the time; and again, &sect; 150, <foreign lang="greek">οὗτός ἐστιν οὐδενὸς ἧττον τῶν λεγόντων δεινὸς εἰπεῖν</foreign>. The Cephisodotus who was sent (with Callias, see note on III 2. 10) to the congress at Sparta in B. C. 371, Xen. Hellen. VI 3. 2, VII 1. 12, seems more <pb n="54"/> likely to have been the orator than the general; and so Schneider pronounces, ad Xen. l. c. Three more <hi rend="italic">bons mots</hi> of the same are quoted, <hi rend="italic">infra</hi> III 10. 7. In Mr Elder's art. Cephisodotus No. 2, <hi rend="italic">Biog. Dict.</hi>, the two are identified. [Arnold Schaefer distinguishes them, <hi rend="italic">Dem. u. s. Zeit</hi> III 2. 155&mdash;6.] </p>
						<p>&lsquo;For all these may be expressed either as similes or as metaphors: and therefore, plainly, all those that are popular when expressed as metaphors, will be also (if required) similes, and similes metaphors without the descriptive details (the detailed explanation)&rsquo;. &ldquo;A simile is a metaphor <hi rend="italic">writ large</hi>, with the details filled in; this is <foreign lang="greek">λόγος</foreign>.&rdquo; Introd. p. 290. </p>
					</div3>
					<div3 id="b3c4s4" type="section" n="4">
						<p>&lsquo;The <hi rend="italic">proportional metaphor</hi> should always be reciprocally transferable, and to either of the two congeners; for instance, if the goblet is Dionysius' shield, then also the shield may be appropriately called Ares' goblet. Such then are the elements of which the speech (or discourse in general, or prose) is composed&rsquo;. This section, and its concluding observation, are fully explained in detail in the Introd, pp. 290&mdash;292, to which the reader is referred. </p>
						<p>Anaxandrides (Meineke, <hi rend="italic">Fragm. Comic. Gr.</hi> III. 201, Anax. Fr. Inc. XXXI.) as well as Antiphanes (<foreign lang="greek">Καινεύς</foreign>, Meineke, <hi rend="italic">Fragm.</hi> III. 58) quote this metaphor of Timotheus in ridicule. From Athenaeus, XI. 502 B, we learn that the goblets which Anaxandrides calls <foreign lang="greek">φιάλας Ἄρεος</foreign> are <foreign lang="greek">τὰς καρυωτάς</foreign>, &lsquo;walnut-shaped&rsquo;. This tends to confirm Twining's remark, on Poet. XXI. 12, note 185, that there was a resemblance in shape between this kind of cup and a shield, which helped to suggest and justify the metaphor. He refers, as also Buhle ad loc. Poet.&mdash;see also Gr&auml;fenhan, ad Poet. p. 157&mdash;to Hom. Il. XXIII 270, on the shape of the <foreign lang="greek">φιύλη, πέμπτῳ δ’  ἀμφίθετον φιάλην ἀπύρωτον ἔθηκε</foreign> and the notes. </p>
						<p>I have followed Bekker, ed. 3, and Spengel, in his recent ed. [1867], who agree in excluding from the text the superfluous <foreign lang="greek">κυὶ ἐπί</foreign>, before <foreign lang="greek">τῶν ὁμογενῶν</foreign>,&mdash;apparently a mere repetition of the preceding <foreign lang="greek">καὶ ἐπί</foreign> before <foreign lang="greek">θάτερα</foreign>. </p>

					<p>Here commences the second division of <foreign lang="greek">λέξις</foreign>, the treatment of style as it appears in the <hi rend="italic">combination</hi> of words in <hi rend="italic">sentences</hi>, and the connexion of the latter in harmonious periods. The <foreign lang="greek">ἀρχή</foreign>, the beginning, basis or <pb n="55"/> foundation, of style in this sense, is <hi rend="italic">purity</hi> of language, <foreign lang="greek">τὸ Ἑλληνίζειν</foreign>, pure and correct Greek, in idiom and choice of words, opposed to barbarism, solecism, and all impropriety in general. The subject of Purity has been already treated in the Introduction, under the head of &lsquo;General observations on Style,&rsquo; p. 279, note 3. </p>
					<p>The divisions of the chapter, the five heads to which Purity may be reduced&mdash;to which are added in the last section two supplementary topics which belong rather to <hi rend="italic">perspicuity</hi>, punctuation and <foreign lang="greek">μεταξυλογία</foreign>, or <hi rend="italic">parenthesis</hi>&mdash;are explained and illustrated by references to the works of other rhetoricians, in the analysis, Introd. pp. 292&mdash;5. </p>
					<p>The classification is, as we shall see, extremely imperfect and deficient; and, moreover, the distinction of <hi rend="italic">purity</hi> and <hi rend="italic">perspicuity</hi> is not carefully observed. Most probably Aristotle did not recognise it at all. Nearly all the precepts given in this chapter are referrible to perspicuity rather than purity. </p>

						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">τὸ ἑλληνίζειν] Ἑλληνισμός, φράσις ἀδιάπτωτος</lemma> (Diogenes Laertius, Zeno, VII. 59). <foreign lang="greek">τὸ ἑλληνίζειν τριττόν· ἢ τὸ τὴν Ἑλληνικὴν συνήθειαν διασώζειν τῶν ὀνομάτων ἐπὶ πάντων· οἱ πολλοί· ἢ τὸ ἀκριβοῦν τὴν Ἑλληνικὴν φωνήν, καὶ τὴν ὀρθότητα τὴν ἐν τῇ προφορᾶ·ͅ οἱ γραμματικοί· ἢ τὴν κυριότητα τῶν ὀνομάτων τὴν κατὰ φύσιν προσήκουσαν τοῖς πράγμασιν· οἱ φιλόσοφοι</foreign> (Schol. ad Plat. p. 70 ap. Gaisford). This takes quite a different view of the meaning of the word to that of Aristotle; in the one case the &lsquo;purity of the Greek&rsquo; is shewn in the choice of words, in the other in the connexion of sentences by observance of the <hi rend="italic">idiom</hi> of the language. But in fact both of these belong to &lsquo;pure Greek&rsquo;: and purity is a <hi rend="italic">negative</hi> quality of style, consisting in the avoidance of error (<foreign lang="greek">φράσις ἀδιάπτωτος</foreign>, <hi rend="italic">emendata locutio</hi>,) in the shape of (1) <hi rend="italic">solecism</hi> (Aristotle's view, idiomatic, grammatical, blunders), (2) <hi rend="italic">barbarism;</hi> the latter, the use especially of <hi rend="italic">foreign</hi> words (whence the name), or any similar impropriety. <hi rend="italic">Atque, ut Latine loquamur, non solum videndum est ut et verba efferamus ea quae nemo iure reprehendat, et ea sic et casibus et temporibus et genere et numero conservemus</hi>, &amp;c.

						<p>&lsquo;The first of these is (the proper use of) <hi rend="italic">connective particles</hi>, that is, when they are made to correspond, in such a natural position (relation) of priority or posteriority to one another in the sentence, as some of them <pb n="56"/> require; as <foreign lang="greek">μέν</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">ἐγὼ μέν</foreign> require <foreign lang="greek">δέ</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">ὁ δέ</foreign> (as correlatives)&rsquo;.

						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ἀποδιδόναι</lemma>] to render, or &lsquo;assign, to its proper place&rsquo;, see note on I 1. 7. <foreign lang="greek">ἀντ-αποδιδόναι</foreign> (in the following clause) is to do this so that there is a &lsquo;reciprocal correspondence&rsquo; between the two, <foreign lang="greek">ἀντ-ἀλλήλοις</foreign>. &lsquo;But this reciprocal correspondence between them should be introduced (by the speaker, <foreign lang="greek">δεῖ τὸν λέγοντα</foreign>) before the audience has had time to forget (<foreign lang="greek">ἕως μέμνηται</foreign>, <hi rend="italic">sc.</hi> <foreign lang="greek">ὁ ἀκροατής</foreign>, while he still retains in his recollection) the <hi rend="italic">first</hi> of the two connectives, with its accompanying clause; and the two should neither be too widely separated, nor should (another) conjunction be introduced before that which is absolutely required; for (such a construction) is seldom appropriate. &ldquo;But I, as soon as he told me&mdash; for Cleon came entreating and requiring (<hi rend="italic">claiming</hi>, demanding)&mdash;set out with them in my company.&rdquo; For in examples like this, several clauses with conjunctions are prematurely inserted before that which is to correspond as the correlative&rsquo;. </p>
						<p>The example of this faulty construction here given is one of the very few which Aristotle has manufactured, contrary to his usual rule of citing examples from the sayings or writings of others supplied by memory. This has been noticed as one of the characteristic differences which distinguish <hi rend="italic">Aristotle's</hi> Rhetoric from the Rhet. ad Alex.&mdash;see Introd. p. 414<note anchored="yes">Where &ldquo;the <hi rend="italic">single</hi> exception, of III 16&rdquo; requires modification: but the exceptions are extremely rare.</note>&mdash;the author of the latter, almost invariably, illustrating his precepts by examples of his own. The example itself, as appears from the <foreign lang="greek">πολλοὶ σύνδεσμοι</foreign> of the ensuing clause, is to be regarded, not as an actual exemplification of the fault, but only as a suggestion of what might be. In itself it is clear enough: but if these parenthetical clauses be <hi rend="italic">multiplied</hi>&mdash;as in fact is very often done in Aristotle's own writings&mdash;. between protasis and apodosis, the hearer, or reader, is very apt to <pb n="57"/> forget the commencement of the sentence, and the argument becomes confused. </p>
						<p>&lsquo;But if the clauses that intervene (before) <foreign lang="greek">ἐπορευόμην</foreign> (<hi rend="italic">between</hi> the <foreign lang="greek">πρότασις</foreign> and it) be numerous, it becomes obscure&rsquo;. <foreign lang="greek">μεταξύ</foreign> is not unfrequently used with only one of the two extremes, between which the intermediate lies, expressed: examples are, Arist. Ach. 432, <foreign lang="greek">Τηλέφου ῥακώματα. κεῖται δ’  ἄνωθεν τῶν Θυεστείων ῥακῶν, μεταξὺ τῶν Ἰνοῦς</foreign>. Aesch. Choeph. 55, <foreign lang="greek">τὰ δ’  ἐν μεταιχμίῳ σκότου</foreign>, for <foreign lang="greek">σκότου καὶ φάους</foreign>. Others in Shilleto's note on Dem. de F. L. &sect; 181, who compares with the last instance, our own <hi rend="italic">twilight</hi>, i.e. &lsquo;betwixt (darkness and) light&rsquo;. Add Soph. Oed. Col. 583, <foreign lang="greek">τὰ ἐν μέσῳ</foreign>. Ib. 291 (with Schneidewin's note). Eur. Hec. 437. [Isocr. Paneg. &sect; 70, <foreign lang="greek">ἐν τῷ μεταξὺ τῆς χώρας</foreign>, Dem. de Corona &sect; 32, <foreign lang="greek">τὸν μεταξὺ χρόνον τῶν ὅρκων</foreign>.] </p>
						<p>A violation of this rule is pointed out by Arnold, on Thuc. I 32. 1. Comp. Quint. VIII 2. 14, 15. The parenthesis, <foreign lang="greek">τὸ μεταξύ</foreign>, is there called <hi rend="italic">interiectio.

						<p>&lsquo;So one point (or head, of merit in style) appears, resides, in the due construction of connectives (conjunctions); a second is to call things by their own proper (special) names, and not by terms that are <hi rend="italic">general</hi> (comprehensive; i. e. names of <hi rend="italic">classes</hi>, abstract terms)&rsquo;. </p>
						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">τὰ περιέχοντα</lemma> is explained by Victorius and Schrader, &lsquo;periphrases, circumlocutions&rsquo;, such as the general definition for the particular object under it, the <foreign lang="greek">λόγος</foreign> for the <foreign lang="greek">ὄνομα</foreign>; or a description in <hi rend="italic">several</hi> words substituted for the <hi rend="italic">single</hi> <foreign lang="greek">ἴδιον ὄνομα</foreign>, as <hi rend="italic">Ibericas herbas</hi> for <hi rend="italic">spartum, duratos muria pisces</hi> for <hi rend="italic">salsamenta</hi>, Quint.

						<p>I have followed this explanation myself in the paraphrase, Introd. p. 293; but I now see that the word cannot bear this meaning, and adopt the explanation of Schweigh&auml;user on Athen.

The genus may be said <foreign lang="greek">περιέχειν</foreign> &lsquo;to comprehend, embrace, include&rsquo;, the species, and individuals of which it is made up; and conversely <foreign lang="greek">περιέχεσθαι</foreign> of the included object, <foreign lang="greek">τὸ ὑποκείμενον</foreign>, Anal.

						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ἀμφιβόλοις</lemma>] I 15. 10. <foreign lang="greek">ἀμφιβολία</foreign> is one of the fallacies of language, <foreign lang="greek">παρὰ τὴν λέξιν</foreign>, &lsquo;ambiguity&rsquo; in words connected in a sentence, &lsquo;in the proposition&rsquo;; distinguished from <foreign lang="greek">ὁμωνυμία</foreign>, ambiguity in single words, de Soph. El. c. 4. It is exemplified, l. c. 166 <hi rend="italic">a</hi> 6 seq. See above, in preliminary observations to II 24. These two last precepts are most probably taken, like the preceding on <foreign lang="greek">σύνδεσμος</foreign>, from Isocrates' <foreign lang="greek">τέχνη</foreign>; and appear also in Rhet. ad Alex. 25 (26) 1, <foreign lang="greek">πρῶτον μὲν οὖν ὀνόμαζε τοῖς οἰκείοις ὀνόμασιν ὅτι ἂν λέγῃς, διαφεύγων τὸ ἀμφίβολον</foreign>. See in the analysis of this treatise, ch. 25, Introd. p. 437. The qualification, <foreign lang="greek">ἂν μὴ τἀναντία προαιρῆται</foreign>, seems to be Aristotle's own. On the various kinds of <foreign lang="greek">ἀμφιβολία</foreign>, <hi rend="italic">ambiguitas</hi>, in Rhetoric <hi rend="italic">sunt innumerabiles</hi> (Quint. VII 9). They may be referred to two general heads; in <hi rend="italic">singulis verbis</hi> (<foreign lang="greek">ὁμωνυμία</foreign>), and <hi rend="italic">coniunctis</hi> (Aristotle's <foreign lang="greek">ἀμφιβολία</foreign>). </p>
						<p>&lsquo;As is done (ambiguous terms employed, by speakers and writers) whenever, having in fact nothing to say, they make a pretence (affect) of saying something; for such (those who pretend to a meaning when there is none) express this no-meaning in verse (comp. III 1. 9, <foreign lang="greek">οἱ ποιηταὶ λέγοντες εὐήθη κ.τ.λ.</foreign>), Empedocles, for instance: for this (roundabout, circuitous, phraseology) circumlocution cheats (deludes) by the multitude (accumulation) of words, and the listeners are affected (i.e. imposed upon) in the same way as the vulgar in the presence of diviners; that is, when (the latter) pronounce their ambiguous utterance, they express their approval by a nod of assent, &ldquo;Croesus, if he pass the Halys, shall destroy a mighty realm&rdquo;&rsquo;. </p>
						<p>The oracle leaves it doubtful whether the power or dominion to be destroyed is his own, or some other. Herod. I 53, 91. Oracles are proverbially ambiguous and enigmatical. [<hi rend="italic">Macbeth</hi>, v 8. 19, <hi rend="italic">Be these juggling fiends no more believed That palter with us in a double sense; That keep the word of promise to our ear; And break it to our hope.</hi> Cicero, de Divin. II 56. 116 (to Pyrrhus), <hi rend="italic">Aio te Aaecida Romanos vincere posse.</hi>] </p>
						<p>Perhaps the two following verses of Empedocles' collected fragments, <pb n="59"/> Karsten, p. 100, lines 106&mdash;7, may in some degree illustrate Aristotle's allusion to this writer, and his sound without sense; </p>
						<p/>
						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">Νεῖκός τ’  οὐλόμενον δίχα τῶν, ἀτάλαντον ἁπάντη, καὶ Φιλότης μετὰ τοῖσιν ἴση μῆκός τε πλάτος τε</lemma>. </p>
						<p>Karsten's remarks on Empedocles' style, <hi rend="italic">de Emp. vita et studiis</hi> p. 60, (prefixed to the Fragm. and Comment.) well illustrate this passage, to which he refers. He notices the obscurity of his diction, which appears especially in the symbolical terms, such as <foreign lang="greek">Νῆστις</foreign>, by which he sometimes designates the elements&mdash;see for instance the four lines, Fragm. 211&mdash;214&mdash;and in the ambiguities ascribed to him here by Aristotle, &ldquo;Nonnunquam vero ad <hi rend="italic">oraculorum</hi> gravitatem adsurgit, quales sunt versus illi, <foreign lang="greek">ἔστιν Ἀνάγκης χρῆμα κ.τ.λ.</foreign> Fragm. init. <foreign lang="greek">ἀλλὰ τὸ μὲν πάντων νόμιμον κ.τ.λ.</foreign> v. 404. Quamobrem minime miramur quod affirmat Theodoretus, seriores fatidicos ex Empedoclis potissimum versibus oracula sua compilasse.&rdquo; </p>
						<p>Aristotle says of him, Poet. I 11, <foreign lang="greek">οὐδὲν δὲ κοινόν ἐστιν Ὁμήρῳ καὶ Ἐμπεδοκλεῖ πλὴν τὸ μέτρον· διὸ τὸν μὲν ποιητὴν δίκαιον καλεῖν, τὸν δὲ φυσιολόγον μᾶλλον ἢ ποιητήν</foreign>. It is curious to contrast this contemptuous judgment of his poetry and the general character and value of his writings, as it may be gathered from the two passages of the Rhet. and Poet., with the glowing eulogium of Lucretius, de rerum nat. I 716&mdash;733. After describing the wonders and good things of Sicily, his birthplace, he concludes, <hi rend="italic">Nil tamen hoc habuisse viro praeclarius in se, nec sanctum magis et mirum carumque videtur. Carmina quin etiam divini pectoris eius vociferantur et exponunt praeclara reperta, ut vix humana videatur stirpe creatus.</hi> And still more remarkable is Aristotle's contradiction of himself, if Diogenes Laertius' quotation, VIII 57, is to be depended upon, <foreign lang="greek">ἐν δὲ τῷ περὶ ποιητῶν φησιν ὅτι καὶ Ὁμηρικὸς ὁ Ἐμπεδοκλῆς καὶ δεινὸς περὶ τὴν φράσιν, κ.τ.λ.</foreign>&mdash;comp. the passage of the Poetics:&mdash;the possible explanation, that what he said in the one refers to the style, and in the other to the contents, of Empedocles' poem, is excluded by the contemptuous remark upon his style in the Rhetoric. On the passage of Lucretius, see Munro's note, I 733. </p>
						<p>Of the vagabond impostors who hawked about spurious oracles and predictions under the names of <foreign lang="greek">μάντεις</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">χρησμολόγοι</foreign>, prophets or diviners and soothsayers, Aristophanes has given us specimens, Hierocles in the &lsquo;Peace,&rsquo; 1252, foll., and the nameless <foreign lang="greek">χρησμολόγος</foreign> in the &lsquo;Birds,&rsquo; 959, foll. </p>
						<p>&lsquo;And by reason of the less liability to mistake in general (by following this course) diviners are accustomed to deliver their predictions in (through the channel, or <hi rend="italic">medium</hi> of) general terms of the fact (which is prophesied), <hi rend="italic">fraus latet in generalibus;</hi> for a man is much more likely to make a hit in playing &ldquo;odd and even&rdquo; by saying &ldquo;even&rdquo; or &ldquo;odd&rdquo;, than <pb n="60"/> any particular number that he has in his hand; or &ldquo;that (the event predicted) <hi rend="italic">will</hi> be&rdquo; than &ldquo;when&rdquo; (it will be); and this is why the soothsayers never add (to their prediction) the <hi rend="italic">precise</hi> time (lit. the definition of the &lsquo;when&rsquo;). All these then (circumlocutions, ambiguities, and the like) are alike (in being <hi rend="italic">faults</hi>) and therefore, unless for some such (reason as was before suggested), to be avoided&rsquo;. </p>
						<p>Of <foreign lang="greek">ἀρτιασμός</foreign> &ldquo;odd and even&rdquo;, (a child's game, played with <foreign lang="greek">ἀστράγαλοι</foreign>, or knuckle-bones, Plato, Lysis 206 E, <foreign lang="greek">ἠρτίαζον ἀστραγάλοις παμπόλλοις</foreign>,) an account is given in Becker's <hi rend="italic">Charicles</hi>, on &lsquo;the games&rsquo;, p. 354; and of the corresponding Latin game <hi rend="italic">par impar</hi> in <hi rend="italic">Gallus</hi>, p. 504. <hi rend="italic">Ludere par impar</hi>, Hor. Sat. II 3. 248 (Heindorf's note), Ovid, Nux Eleg. line 79, <hi rend="italic">est etiam, par sit numerus, qui dicat, an impar.</hi> The game might be played with any kind of counters, beans, acorns, coins&mdash;in Carion's house, after he had grown rich, Arist. Plut. 816, &ldquo;the servants played at odd and even with golden staters.&rdquo; It is usually described as played by two persons, one of whom held in his closed hand a number of counters, and the other had to guess whether it was odd or even. This was no doubt one way of playing it, but there was also another not quite so simple, as appears from this passage of the Rhetoric, and also from the Schol. on Plut. 1057, in which the guess was made at the <hi rend="italic">number</hi>, <foreign lang="greek">πόσα</foreign>. In the Plutus, l. c., the game is played with &lsquo;walnuts&rsquo;, <foreign lang="greek">κάρυα</foreign>, and the Scholiast's comment is, &ldquo;one grasps a handful of walnuts, and with his hand stretched out asks, how many? and if the other guesses right, he receives all the contents of his hand; if wrong, he <hi rend="italic">pays</hi> the number found in the other's hand when opened.&rdquo; </p>
						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">οἱ χρησμολόγοι οὐ προσορίζονται τὸ πότε</lemma>] On this intentional indefiniteness and obscurity of would-be prophets, Victorius refers to Aeschines c. Ctes. &sect; 99, who contrasts Demosthenes with other <foreign lang="greek">ἀλάζονες</foreign>, who <foreign lang="greek">ὅταν τι ψεύδωνται, ἀόριστα καὶ ἀσαφῆ πειρῶνται λέγειν, φοβούμενοι τὸν ἔλεγχον</foreign>: and, to the same effect, of a supposed citation from the Sibylline verses, Cic. de Divin. II 54. 110, <hi rend="italic">Callide enim qui illa composuit perfecit ut, quodcumque accidisset, praedictum videretur, hominum et temporum definitione sublata.</hi> </p>

						<p>&lsquo;Fourthly, to observe Protagoras' division of the classes (classification) of nouns, into <hi rend="italic">male, female</hi>, and <hi rend="italic">inanimate</hi> (prop. implements): for these also must be correctly assigned, each to its proper place&rsquo;.

						<p>&lsquo;And, as a general rule, every written composition must be easy to read, or&mdash;which is much the same thing&mdash;to speak, or deliver&rsquo;. Comp. Quint. VIII 2. 17. Demetr. <foreign lang="greek">περὶ ἑρμηνείας</foreign>, &sect; 193 (Spengel, <hi rend="italic">Rhet.

This is opposed to declamatory speaking, <foreign lang="greek">ὑποκριτικὴ λέξις, ἡ διαλελυμένη</foreign>, in which the want of exact connexion&mdash;particularly asyndeton, the omission of <foreign lang="greek">καί</foreign>&mdash;often aids the effect: comp. &sect; 194. </p>
						<p>&lsquo;This is wanting (in compositions in which) conjunctions and other connecting particles are numerous, and such as are not easy to <hi rend="italic">punctuate</hi>, like those of Heraclitus&rsquo;. This does not contradict what was said before about the necessity of conjunctions, &amp;c., to ensure perspicuity, it only condemns the excessive use of them; a long string of connected clauses is apt to lead to obscurity: the due mean is to be observed, here as elsewhere. With what follows compare Demetrius, u. s. &sect; 192, <foreign lang="greek">τὸ δὲ ἀσύνδετον καὶ διαλελυμένον ὅλον ἀσαφὲς πᾶν· ἄδηλος γὰρ ἡ ἑκάστου κώλου ἀρχὴ διὰ τὴν λύσιν, ὥσπερ τὰ Ἡρακλείτου· καὶ γὰρ ταῦτα σκοτεινὰ ποιεῖ τὸ πλεῖστον ἡ λύσις</foreign>, and Theon, Progymn. <foreign lang="greek">περὶ διηγήματος</foreign> &sect; 187 (Spengel, <hi rend="italic">Rhet.

This want of punctuation is not by any means the only, or indeed the principal, source of the obscurity of the mystic enigmatical sayings of the &lsquo;dark&rsquo; philosopher. The remains of these have been collected by Schleiermacher, Bernays [and Bywater] in their respective tracts, and several of the most remarkable quoted by Thompson in his note on Butler's <hi rend="italic">Lect. on Anc.

						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">διαστίξαι] διὰ στίζειν</lemma>, (&lsquo;to prick&rsquo;), is &lsquo;to <hi rend="italic">distinguish</hi> or duly distribute by <hi rend="italic">pointing</hi> or punctuation&rsquo;. Two examples similar to this are given in de Soph. El. c. 4, 166 <hi rend="italic">a</hi> 36, in illustration of the fallacy of <foreign lang="greek">διαίρεσις</foreign>. </p>
						<p>&lsquo;For to punctuate Heraclitus' writing is a hard matter (a difficult <hi rend="italic">job, a business</hi>), owing to the uncertainty as to which of the two (words), the preceding or following, (any particular word) is attached; as for instance, at the commencement of his (<foreign lang="greek">αὐτοῦ</foreign>, masc.) composition, where he says, &ldquo;Of this reason constant (being) ever (reading <foreign lang="greek">τοῦδ’  ἐόντος ἀεί</foreign>) men come into being devoid of understanding&rdquo;; for this leaves it uncertain to which of the two (<foreign lang="greek">ἐόντος</foreign> or <foreign lang="greek">ἀξύνετοι γίγνονται</foreign>) the word <hi rend="italic">ever</hi> should be attached by the punctuation&rsquo;. Bekker, who in his first edition reads <foreign lang="greek">τοῦ δέοντος</foreign>, has in the third altered it to <foreign lang="greek">τοῦδ’  ἔοντος</foreign>. Spengel retains the former&mdash;which is the reading of MS A^{c} (or A). <foreign lang="greek">τοῦδ’  ἐόντος</foreign>, which had been already proposed by Victorius from a passage of Sext. Empir., is undoubtedly right. The words are quoted also by Clemens Alex. <hi rend="italic">Strom.</hi> V 14, p. 716, by Eusebius, <hi rend="italic">Praep. Evang.</hi> XIII, and by Sextus Empiricus <hi rend="italic">adv. Math.</hi> VII 132, who extracts several lines, reading <foreign lang="greek">τοῦδε ἐόντος</foreign>, and omitting <foreign lang="greek">ἀεί</foreign>, which are cited and commented on by Schleiermacher in his tract on the fragments of Heraclitus, No. 47, p. 482. Clemens and Eusebius have <foreign lang="greek">τοῦ δέοντος</foreign> (Schleierm.). The <foreign lang="greek">λόγος</foreign>, according to Sextus&mdash; and this is confirmed by Heraclitus' context, which he quotes&mdash;is the universal reason, <foreign lang="greek">ὁ θεῖος λόγος</foreign>, of which men are unconscious, depending rather upon sense, though it is the true <foreign lang="greek">κριτήριον. τοῖτον δὴ τὸν κοινὸν λόγον καὶ θεῖον, καὶ οὗ κατὰ μετοχὴν γινόμεθα λογικοί, κριτήριον ἀληθείας φησὶν ὁ Ἡράκλειτος</foreign>. This interpretation of course requires <foreign lang="greek">ἔοντος</foreign>. An additional argument in its favour is suggested by Schleiermacher, that if <foreign lang="greek">δεόντος</foreign> had been the reading in Aristotle's copy of Heraclitus, he would have found no difficulty in the reference of <foreign lang="greek">ἀεί</foreign>. The title of his <foreign lang="greek">σύγγραμμα</foreign>&mdash;which is omitted by Diogenes in his life, IX I, though the <foreign lang="greek">σύγγραμμα</foreign> itself is twice mentioned, &sect;&sect; 6, 7, and some of its contents quoted in the 7th and follow<pb n="63"/> ing sections&mdash;seems to have been <foreign lang="greek">περὶ φύσεως</foreign>; the ordinary title of works upon similar subjects by the earlier cosmical speculators, as Empedocles, Anaxagoras, &amp;c. </p>

					<p>Of <foreign lang="greek">ὄγκος</foreign> (swelling), pomp, grandeur, dignity (Auct. ad Heren.

XXIV. 9, <foreign lang="greek">τὸ γὰρ ἡρωϊκὸν στασιμώτατον καὶ ὀγκωδέστατον τῶν μέτρων ἐστίν</foreign>. Ib. &sect; 6, <foreign lang="greek">ὁ τοῦ ποιήματος ὄγκος</foreign>.

This is near akin to <foreign lang="greek">σεμνότης</foreign>, on which Hermogenes has a chapter, <foreign lang="greek">περὶ ἰδεῶν, τομ. ά</foreign>. (Spengel, <hi rend="italic">Rhet. Gr.</hi> II. 287), and <foreign lang="greek">περὶ σεμνοῦ λόγου, περὶ εὑρέσεως, τομ. δ̓</foreign>. c. 11 (Ib. p. 255), and again <foreign lang="greek">περὶ μ&lt;&gt;γέθους</foreign>, in the preceding chap. 10, p. 286. So Demetrius writes  <foreign lang="greek">περὶ</foreign> <pb n="65"/> <foreign lang="greek">μεγαλοπρεποῦς</foreign>, in his <foreign lang="greek">περὶ ἑρμηνείας</foreign>, &sect; 38, seq. (Spengel, <hi rend="italic">Rhet. Gr.</hi> III. 270 seq.): and Dion. Hal., de Dinarch. Iud. 3. 7, attributes <foreign lang="greek">μεγαλοπρέπεια</foreign> to Demosthenes' style. And in these writers <foreign lang="greek">ὄγκος, μέγεθος</foreign>, and <foreign lang="greek">ἀξίωμα</foreign> (dignity) are often associated as characteristics of style. In Top. <foreign lang="greek">Θ</foreign> 1, 155 <hi rend="italic">b</hi> 22, <foreign lang="greek">ἢ εἰς ὄγκον τοῦ λόγου</foreign> (one of the four motives for multiplying <foreign lang="greek">προτάσεις</foreign>), it means nothing more than a device for swelling out, increasing the bulk of, the discourse or argument. </p>
					<p>In the language of Rhetoric we see that <foreign lang="greek">ὄγκος</foreign> implies excellence and is a virtue of style. In the vulgar usage of common life, when it and its derivatives are applied metaphorically, as they often are, it may bear either a favourable or an unfavourable interpretation. In the latter case the &lsquo;pomp&rsquo; of style becomes &lsquo;pomposity&rsquo;, and the &lsquo;swelling phrases&rsquo; turgid and inflated <hi rend="italic">ampullae.</hi> And in a moral sense the same notion of <hi rend="italic">fastus</hi> is attached to it, and it comes to denote vanity, ostentation, arrogance, as Plat. Meno 90 A, where it is personal, and opposed to <foreign lang="greek">κόσμιος</foreign>. In Soph. Oed. Col. 1162, <foreign lang="greek">βραχὺν μῦθον οὐκ ὄγκου πλέων</foreign> is a short conversation without &lsquo;bulk&rsquo;, not unnaturally and unreasonably <hi rend="italic">swelled out</hi> or lengthened. <foreign lang="greek">ὀγκωθεὶς χλιδῇ</foreign> in the same author (Fragm. Inc. ap. Stobaeum, No. 679, Dind.) has the same sense in a moral application. And so <foreign lang="greek">ὄγκον αἴρειν</foreign>, Soph. Aj. 129. <foreign lang="greek">τὸ ὀγκηρόν</foreign>, Ar. Eth. N. IV. 13, <hi rend="italic">sub finem</hi>, is again &lsquo;inflated&rsquo;, of mere bulk without solidity, show without substance; i. e. morally, &lsquo;ostentation&rsquo;, a pretentious air and exterior, assumption. See Ernesti, <hi rend="italic">Lex. Tech. Gr.</hi> s. vv. <foreign lang="greek">ὀγκηρόν, ὄγκος, ὀγκοῦν, ὀγκῶδες</foreign>. </p>
					<div3 id="b3c6s1" type="section" n="1">
						<p>&lsquo;To dignity, amplification of style, the following things contribute; first, the substitution of definition (or detailed description) for the (direct, proper) name (of the object); to say for example not <hi rend="italic">circle</hi>, but &ldquo;a plane figure which is in all points equidistant from the centre&rsquo;&rdquo;. One would have supposed that this was an exemplification rather of the unfavourable sense of <foreign lang="greek">ὄγκος</foreign>: it also seems to be opposed to what was said c. 5. 3, <foreign lang="greek">τοῖς ἰδίοις ὀνόμασι λέγειν καὶ μὴ τοῖς περιέχουσιν</foreign>: and in fact dignity ought not to interfere with perspicuity. The two precepts, however, do not in reality contradict one another. The use of abstract, general terms, instead of the plain and direct individual names, is a source of obscurity: there is no obscurity, but rather the contrary, in setting forth the definition of it at length. &lsquo;For (the purpose of) brevity the contrary (is the rule), the proper name, and <hi rend="italic">not</hi> the definition&rsquo;. Both of these precepts appear in the Rhet. ad Alex. c. 22 (23) &sect;&sect; 3 and 5.

The leaves of the tablets, which were thin slabs or plates of wood coated with wax, were sometimes shaped like doors (a very natural form to give them), whence the name <foreign lang="greek">θύρα</foreign>. Pollux IV 18 (ap. Herm. ad Iph. T. 715), <foreign lang="greek">οἱ δὲ Ἀττικοὶ γραμματεῖον δίθυρον· καὶ θύρας τὰς πτύχας, ἄχρι δύο· εἶτα πτύχας, καὶ τρίπτυχον καὶ πολύπτυχον</foreign>.

Consequently the <hi rend="italic">general</hi> rule (which is stated here) is to avoid it: but in special cases, where the aim is to give emphasis and vigour, rapidity and conciseness to a narrative, it may often be used with advantage, as the examples will shew.

						<p>The meaning of &sect; 6 is this.

Sed quamvis ei secundas fere grammaticorum</hi> (of Alexandria) <hi rend="italic">consensus deferat; et affectibus et iucunditate et dispositione et omnino arte deficitur, ut plane manifesto appareat quanto sit aliud proximum esse, aliud secundum:</hi> (so Horace of Jupiter, <hi rend="italic">nec viget quicquam simile aut</hi> secundum; proximos illi tamen <hi rend="italic">occupavit Pallas honores</hi>). He is called by some authors Clarian, by others Colophonian. Claros was a small town near Colophon, a colony and dependency of it. Most probably Claros was his birthplace, for which the more important and neighbouring mother-city was substituted. See further on Antimachus in Schrader and Buhle's notes; and on Teumessus, Valken. ad Phoen. 1107. </p>
						<p>[<foreign lang="greek">ἐξ ὧν μὴ ἔχει</foreign>. This device of description by a series of negations may be exemplified by Homer's Odyss. VI 43, (Olympus) <foreign lang="greek">οὔτ’  ἀνέμοισι τινάσσεται οὔτε ποτ̓ ὄμβρῳ δεύεται οὔτε χιὼν ἐπιπίλναται</foreign> (and Lucr. III. 18). There are some striking instances in an expanded Anglo-Saxon paraphrase by Cynewulf of Lactantius' poem <hi rend="italic">de Phoenice, And there nor rain nor snow, nor breath of frost, Nor blast of fire, nor rush of rattling hail, Nor fall of rime nor scorching heat of sun, Nor lasting cold nor drought nor winter-shower</hi>...(This translation is due to the Rev. W. W. Skeat).] </p>
						<p>&lsquo;This mode of treatment, that the things are not there, (or that the object of praise or censure has them not,) may be applied to things either good or bad (to <hi rend="italic">bad</hi> things in a panegyric, to <hi rend="italic">good</hi> as virtues, accomplishments, merits of all kinds, in a censure or invective), in whichever of the two ways it may be serviceable (or, whichever of the two the occasion may require). Hence (from the <hi rend="italic">absence</hi> of a certain quality or attribute) the poets also derive their epithets (<foreign lang="greek">ὄνομα</foreign> here stands for an adjective: see Introd. Appendix A to Bk. III on <foreign lang="greek">ὀνόματα</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">ῥήματα</foreign>) <pb n="70"/> such as <hi rend="italic">a stringless</hi> or <hi rend="italic">lyreless music</hi>&rsquo;&mdash;music, but without the ordinary accompaniment or instrument, the strings of the lyre, or the lyre itself: applied to the sound of the <hi rend="italic">wind</hi>-instrument, the trumpet&mdash;&lsquo;for they apply privative epithets; this being popular when expressed in the metaphors of proportion, as when the (sound or music of the) trumpet is called a lyreless music&rsquo;. </p>
						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ἐκ τῶν στερήσεων...ἐπιφέρουσιν</lemma>] <hi rend="italic">lit.</hi> they attach epithets borrowed or derived from <hi rend="italic">privations</hi>: <foreign lang="greek">στέρησις</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">ἕξις</foreign> being one of the four forms of opposition: Categ. c. 10, 11 <hi rend="italic">b</hi> 17 and 12 <hi rend="italic">a</hi> 26 seq. </p>
						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">μεταφοραῖς...ταῖς ἀνάλογον] ἀνάλογον</lemma> in this combination seems to be used adverbially; comp. <hi rend="italic">supra</hi> c. 4 &sect;&sect; 3, 4, <foreign lang="greek">τὴν μεταφορὰν τὴν ἐκ τοῦ ἀνάλογον</foreign>, <hi rend="italic">infra</hi> c. 7 &sect; 10, <foreign lang="greek">τοῖς ἀνάλογον</foreign>. On the proportional metaphor, the best of all the four kinds, I have already referred (on III 4. 4) to the Introd. pp. 290&mdash;292. See also Appendix B Bk. III on Metaphor, where this is fully explained. </p>
						<p>Comp. with this section Poet. XXI 15, 16 <foreign lang="greek">ἔστι δὲ τῷ τρόπῳ τούτῳ τῆς μεταφορᾶς</foreign> (the proportional, to wit) <foreign lang="greek">χρῆσθαι καὶ ἄλλως, προσαγορεύσαντα τὸ ἀλλότριον ἀποφῆσαι τῶν οἰκείων τι, οἷον εἰ τὴν ἀσπίδα εἴποι φιάλην μὴ Ἄρεως ἀλλ’  ἄοινον</foreign> (Victorius' <hi rend="italic">emendatio palmaria</hi> for the <hi rend="italic">vulgata lectio</hi> <foreign lang="greek">ἀλλ’  οἴνου</foreign>). </p>
						<p>I transcribe Twining's excellent note on this passage, which well illustrates our present subject. Note 189, p. 446. &ldquo;Metaphors from their nature are in danger of being obscure or forced, though it is essential to their beauty and effect that they should be clear and apposite. For this purpose a metaphor may be guarded in various ways. If the simple substitution of the improper for the proper term would be obscure or harsh, the metaphor may be converted into an <hi rend="italic">image</hi> or <hi rend="italic">comparison</hi> (referring to Demetrius, <foreign lang="greek">περὶ ἑρμηνείας</foreign> &sect; 80); it may be used <hi rend="italic">analogically</hi>, and we may say <foreign lang="greek">φιάλη Ἄρεως</foreign> or <foreign lang="greek">φιάλη ἄοινος</foreign>; or if that be not sufficient for perspicuity&mdash;that is, if the meaning be not sufficiently pointed out by the manner or circumstances in which the expression is introduced&mdash; we may join these (<foreign lang="greek">φιάλη Ἄρεως ἄοινος</foreign>), or even add to either of them the <hi rend="italic">proper</hi> word itself. There is a fine instance of this <hi rend="italic">negative</hi> mode of explaining a metaphor in Isaiah li. 21, &lsquo;Thou drunken, <hi rend="italic">but not with wine.</hi>&rsquo; The same end is often answered by an epithet <hi rend="italic">affirming</hi> of the thing <hi rend="italic">expressed</hi> some quality of the thing <hi rend="italic">signified;</hi> thus ships are <hi rend="italic">floating bulwarks</hi> [Mason's Ode to the Naval Officers], and the lyre a <hi rend="italic">chorded shell</hi>, where Dryden [Song for St Cecilia's Day, line 17, <hi rend="italic">Jubal struck the chorded shell</hi>,] has made the same use of the affirmative epithet <hi rend="italic">chorded</hi> that Theognis did of the negative <foreign lang="greek">ἄχορδος</foreign> in his metaphorical expression for a bow, <foreign lang="greek">φόρμιγξ ἄχορδος</foreign> (comp. Rhet. III 11. 11, and Demetr. <foreign lang="greek">περὶ ἑρμηνείας</foreign> &sect; 85, quoted in Introd. p. 297). Sometimes the explanatory epithet is itself a metaphor; as in the <foreign lang="greek">πτερωτοῖς ἅρμασι</foreign> (Iph. Aul. 251) of Euripides, &lsquo;winged chariots&rsquo;. Here we have a double metaphor: <hi rend="italic">chariot</hi> for <hi rend="italic">ship</hi>, and <hi rend="italic">wing</hi> for <hi rend="italic">sail.</hi>&rdquo; <pb n="71"/> </p>
						<p>He then concludes with four examples of these privative explanatory epithets from the Greek Tragedians, which I have already quoted with some others in the Introduction p. 297, in the note on this passage of the Rhetoric. Add to these Cephisodotus' &lsquo;parti-coloured millstones&rsquo;, <foreign lang="greek">μύλωνας ποικίλους</foreign>, III 10. 7, by which he meant to represent the &lsquo;crushing&rsquo; properties of the Athenian &lsquo;triremes&rsquo; in devastating the coasts and islands and exacting tribute. These differ from millstones in having their sides gaily painted in various colours. <foreign lang="greek">ἄπτερος φάτις</foreign>, Aesch. Agam. 267 (contrasted with <foreign lang="greek">ἔπεα πτεροέντα</foreign>), <foreign lang="greek">ἄπτερος ὄρνις</foreign>, Eur. Iph. Taur. 1095. [Eur. Phoen. 791 (<foreign lang="greek">Ἄρης</foreign>) <foreign lang="greek">κῶμον ἀναυλότατον προχορεύεις, 808 Σφιγγὸς ἀμουσοτάταισι σὺν ᾠδαῖς</foreign>, Herc. Fur. 879, 891, 892. Similarly the Italian poet, Guarini, called birds &lsquo;winged lyres&rsquo;.] </p>
						<p>It remains to notice the <hi rend="italic">proportion</hi> of the metaphor, which, according to Victorius, is Trumpet: sound of trumpet (anonymous) :: lyre : <foreign lang="greek">μέλος</foreign>, the music of the lyre (<hi rend="italic">properly</hi> so called). To qualify the harshness, throw light on the obscurity, of this improper application of the word <foreign lang="greek">μελος</foreign>, the epithet <foreign lang="greek">ἄλυρον</foreign> &ldquo;not that of the lyre&rdquo; is added. </p>
						<p>One more remark on privative epithet, which has not been pointed out. They have two uses, the one to <hi rend="italic">qualify</hi>, the other to <hi rend="italic">contradict</hi>, the substantive they are joined with. In the latter case they are not metaphors at all. This is what is called the figure <hi rend="italic">oxymoron</hi>, which combines in one expression two contradictory notions of which the one denies the other: <foreign lang="greek">ἐχθρῶν ἄδωρα δῶρα</foreign> (Aj. 655), an enemy's gifts are no gifts at all; <foreign lang="greek">χάρις ἄχαρις</foreign> &ldquo;graceless grace&rdquo;, or &ldquo;thankless favour&rdquo;; <foreign lang="greek">μήτηρ ἀμήτωρ</foreign>, Soph. El. 1154; <foreign lang="greek">γάμος ἄγαμος</foreign>, Oed. T. 1214; <foreign lang="greek">ἄοικον εἰσοίκησιν</foreign>, Phil. 534; <foreign lang="greek">ὕπνος ἄϋπνος</foreign> Ib. 848; <foreign lang="greek">βίος ἀβίωτος</foreign> or <foreign lang="greek">ἀβίοτος</foreign> (Eur. Hipp. 821, 867), <hi rend="italic">insaniens sapientia, strenua inertia.</hi> </p>

So <foreign lang="greek">σχεδία</foreign> is &lsquo;a raft&rsquo;, a vessel <hi rend="italic">extemporised</hi>, constructed on the spur of the moment to meet a sudden occasion.

In the Paris MS, indeed, there is a mark of omission which Buhle and Hermann have indicated in their editions. He understands <foreign lang="greek">κόσμος</foreign> to signify &ldquo;such an epithet as embellishes or <hi rend="italic">elevates</hi> the thing to which it is applied.&rdquo; Though he quotes this passage of the Rhetoric, he does not notice that <foreign lang="greek">ἐπῇ</foreign> here applied to it proves that the kind of <hi rend="italic">ornament</hi> intended by <foreign lang="greek">κόσμος</foreign> is an ornamental <hi rend="italic">epithet.</hi> See also Gr&auml;fenhan, on Poet.

						<p>The logic of the fallacy is explained in de Soph. El. c. 5, 167 <hi rend="italic">b</hi> 1 seq. It proceeds from the false assumption, in antecedent and consequent, that they are reciprocally convertible: that if a consequent always follows an antecedent the converse is likewise true, and that the consequent in<pb n="75"/> variably implies the antecedent as well as the antecedent the consequent. Here, the language &amp;c. used <hi rend="italic">is</hi> the ordinary sign of the emotion represented, as they themselves know from their own experience; and <hi rend="italic">does</hi> usually arise in men as a consequence of such facts as those alleged: the antecedent is then falsely inferred &lsquo;reciprocally&rsquo; from the <hi rend="italic">ordinary</hi>, but not necessary or universal, consequent.

The <foreign lang="greek">διό</foreign> is, because the listener always sympathizes with the language and raised tone of passion; the more violent the expression of it, the more he is likely to be affected.

						<p>&lsquo;And this mode of proof arising out of (external) signs (exhibited in language, tone, and action) may be invested also with an ethical character, in that (in so far as) that which is appropriate (i. e. the appropriate language, &amp;c.) to each class and moral state (i. e. character, <foreign lang="greek">ἦθος</foreign>; the sum of the moral states and habits which characterizes the individual) is attendant upon each of them&rsquo;.

						<p>In the Introduction, p. 108 foll., on <foreign lang="greek">ἦθος</foreign>, I have endeavoured to shew (against Spengel) that there are three kinds of <foreign lang="greek">ἤθη</foreign> distinguished by Aristotle in the Rhetoric; (1) the <foreign lang="greek">ἦθος ἐν τῷ λέγοντι</foreign>, the personal character exhibited by the speaker himself, serving as a kind of proof of his sincerity, competency, and good will; (2) the characters of certain <pb n="76"/> ages and classes, with which the speaker must be previously acquainted, in order to accommodate his general tone, and the opinions he expresses, to the tastes and dispositions of his audience, their political sentiments and such like: as for instance an audience of rich and poor, young and old, aristocratic and democratical, must be addressed each in a different tone and with different language, suitable to their several opinions and prejudices; and (3) what I have called the <hi rend="italic">dramatic</hi> characters, which are treated only in the third book as belonging to style, and are still more important, and occupy a larger share of attention in poetry (especially dramatic poetry)&mdash;and therefore in the Poetics XV&mdash;than in the prose of Rhetoric. These consist in the accurate representation of <hi rend="italic">personal</hi> character, as described by Horace, A. P. 114 seq. See also the instances given in the parallel passage, III 16. 9, above referred to. This is what is now called &lsquo;keeping&rsquo;, and seems to me to be totally distinct from the second, which refers to <hi rend="italic">classes;</hi> although the two have some points in common. The principal differences between them are that the latter describes <hi rend="italic">personal peculiarities</hi>, and is an ingredient of <hi rend="italic">propriety of style:</hi> and the two are therefore treated in different parts of the work. The dramatic <foreign lang="greek">ἦθος</foreign>, <hi rend="italic">morata oratio</hi>, does however in some inferior degree assist the <hi rend="italic">argument</hi>, as Aristotle has just told us, and is a <hi rend="italic">kind</hi> of <foreign lang="greek">δεῖξις</foreign>; it conveys a favourable impression of the accuracy of the speaker, and the truth of his description. </p>
						<p>&lsquo;By <hi rend="italic">class</hi> I mean (according to age, different ages) the various ages of life, youth, manhood, old age; and (sexes) woman or man, and (natives of different countries) Lacedaemonian or Thessalian; and by <hi rend="italic">states</hi> (moral states) those by which the character (or quality) of a man's life is determined: for it is not every kind of <hi rend="italic">state</hi> that determines the character of men's lives&rsquo;. <foreign lang="greek">Ἕξις</foreign>, an acquired, developed, permanent, habit, is a general term (opposed to <foreign lang="greek">διάθεσις</foreign> an incomplete and progressive state, Categ.) and applicable to various states in men and things, <hi rend="italic">physical</hi> as well as <hi rend="italic">intellectual</hi> and <hi rend="italic">moral.</hi> It is only the last two that determine the <foreign lang="greek">ἦθος</foreign>. </p>

						<p>&lsquo;The hearers are affected also in some degree (some impression is also made upon the audience) by what (a trick which) the speech-writers employ to a nauseous excess; (the introduction viz. of such phrases as) &ldquo;Who doesn't know?&rdquo; &ldquo;Everybody knows.&rdquo; For the listener is shamed into an admission (of the fact) that he may be supposed to share (what is assumed to be) the feeling of &ldquo;everybody else&rdquo;&rsquo;. </p>

Victorius supposes, in accordance with his preconceived opinion of a still continued hostility between Aristotle and Isocrates, that the latter is here alluded to; quoting four instances of it from Isocrates and two from Demosth. de Cor. This is hardly enough to sustain the charge. On this subject, see Introd. p. 41, foll. </p>

						<p>The reading of all MSS is <foreign lang="greek">προσεπιπλήττει</foreign>, which the staunch Bekker and Spengel, the consistent adherent of A or A^{c}, both retain. Nevertheless, the emendation <foreign lang="greek">προεπιπλήττει</foreign> makes excellent sense, and its rival is decidedly inferior; and a passage of Quintilian, VIII 3. 37, which seems to have been copied from this of Aristotle and repeats his words, has (in the Greek words) <foreign lang="greek">προεπιπλήσσειν τῇ ὑπερβολῇ</foreign>, and a little above, <hi rend="italic">praemuniendum</hi>, which also seems to be a reminiscence of <foreign lang="greek">προεπιπλήττειν</foreign>; Spalding (ad loc. Quint.) and Gesner approve, and Casaubon had <pb n="78"/> already suggested this emendation, and Stephens introduced it in his Lexicon. Supported by this evidence, and the common-sense view of the case, I venture to read <foreign lang="greek">προεπιπλήττειν</foreign>. The passage of Quintilian above referred to runs thus:&mdash;<hi rend="italic">Et si quid periculosius finxisse videbimur, quibusdam remediis praemuniendum est</hi>, ut ita dicam; si licet dicere; quodam modo; permittite mihi sic uti. <hi rend="italic">Quod idem etiam in iis quae licentius translata erunt proderit, quae non tuto dici possunt.

					<div3 id="b3c7s10" type="section" n="10">
						<p>The greatest care and pains are always requisite to give the speech an <hi rend="italic">artless</hi>, natural, and unstudied character: the rule <hi rend="italic">ars est celare artem</hi> is of the utmost importance in effecting the end and object of a speech, persuasion or conviction. See, for instance, III 2. 4, 5; 8. 1. This applies equally to proportion, as an element of propriety. It has been laid down that a certain proportion (or resemblance) of style, tone, and manner to the subject is always to be observed: but this, if carried too far, will defeat its own object; the study will appear, and the suspicions of the hearers will be aroused. For instance, there is a proportion in the tone of voice and manner of delivery, in the expression of features and the action, to the subject of the words delivered: these however should not be all employed at once: if the words have a <hi rend="italic">harsh</hi> sound&mdash;<foreign lang="greek">σκληρὰ ὀνόματα</foreign> are exemplified by Hermogenes <foreign lang="greek">περὶ ἰδεῶν, ά, περὶ τραχύτητος</foreign>, p. 236, II 300 (<hi rend="italic">Rhet. Gr.</hi> Spengel), by <foreign lang="greek">ἀταρπός, ἔμαρπτεν, ἔγναμψε</foreign>, &amp;c., and again, Ib. <foreign lang="greek">β̓</foreign>, (II 359), by a line from Homer in which <foreign lang="greek">ἀγκὰς ἔμαρπτε</foreign>, both of them objectionable on this ground, occur together. &ldquo;The voice and the features and the rest should not be made to assume a harsh expression, else the study becomes apparent&mdash;it will give the composition a stiff and studied appearance, make it look affected and overdone: whereas, if one or two of them are made to correspond, and the rest not, the same <hi rend="italic">effect</hi> is produced, whilst the <hi rend="italic">artifice</hi> escapes detection&rdquo;. Introd. pp. 301, 2. Compare on this subject, Cic. de Or. III 57. 216. </p>
						<p>&lsquo;Further, not to employ all these proportions (or correspondences) together; for by the observance of this precept (following this rule) the listener is deluded (i.e. the art is disguised). I mean, to take an instance if the words used are harsh (in <hi rend="italic">sound</hi>), not to (extend the harshness) to <pb n="79"/> the tone of voice and the features and the other appropriate (correspondences or proportions)&rsquo;: (we must supply here either <foreign lang="greek">χρῆσθαι</foreign> from <foreign lang="greek">χρήσασθαι</foreign> preceding; or, <hi rend="italic">ad sensum</hi>, from <foreign lang="greek">σκληρὰ ᾖ, σκληρότητα προσφέρειν</foreign>, or something else similar). &lsquo;Otherwise the true character of each of them (their studied and artificial character, <foreign lang="greek">πέπλασθαι</foreign> <hi rend="italic">supra</hi> 2. 4) becomes manifest&rsquo;. </p>
						<p>Vahlen, in his observations on the Rhetoric, <hi rend="italic">Trans. Vienn. Acad.</hi> p. 144 (already referred to), says, that nothing else can be implied in <foreign lang="greek">τοῖς ἁρμόττουσιν</foreign> than the adaptation of voice and feature to subject, already specified; and therefore proposes to strike out <foreign lang="greek">καί</foreign> before <foreign lang="greek">τοῖς ἁρμόττουσιν</foreign> so that <foreign lang="greek">τοῖς ἁρμόττουσιν</foreign> may be connected with, not distinguished from, the two preceding. This seems to me quite unnecessary. Besides the two proportions specified by Aristotle, there is at all events <foreign lang="greek">ὑπόκρισις</foreign>, appropriate action or gesticulation, that may be brought into correspondence; and also the mode of delivery may be distinguished&mdash;at all events for the nonce&mdash;from the other three. And he adds a similar objection to another perfectly innocent <foreign lang="greek">καί</foreign>, in I 15. 28, <foreign lang="greek">καὶ ὡς οὗτος κ.τ.λ.</foreign>, the sense (as I have explained it in the paraphrase of the Introduction) being at least equally good with, as without, the conjunction. </p>
						<p>In the succeeding clause&mdash;which guards against a possible misapprehension of the foregoing, as though it were meant that <hi rend="italic">all</hi> this kind of adaptation should be avoided, and intimates that the <hi rend="italic">mean</hi> is to be observed here as everywhere else; that we do not rush into the opposite extreme, like those who <hi rend="italic">dum vitant stulti vitia in contraria currunt</hi>&mdash;the connexion of thought might seem to require that <foreign lang="greek">ἐὰν δέ</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">ἐὰν οὖν</foreign> should change places. If the two clauses, <foreign lang="greek">ἐὰν δέ, ἐὰν οὖν</foreign>, <hi rend="italic">are</hi> to be connected in sense, we require some kind of opposition, expressed by a restrictive or adversative particle such as <foreign lang="greek">μέντοι, δέ</foreign>, or <foreign lang="greek">ἀλλά</foreign>, to establish this, and not one that conveys an inference or consequence, which does <hi rend="italic">not</hi> follow from the foregoing. </p>
						<p>&lsquo;But if (the speaker introduce) one and omit the other (make the adaptation in some cases, in others not), he does the same thing (really has recourse to study and art) and yet escapes detection. So then&rsquo;, (it results in a general way from all this,) or, &lsquo;well then&mdash;as I say&mdash;if things soft and mild (for instance, the expression of compassion) be represented by a harsh tone and language, or harsh things in soft tone and language (so Victorius), it (the expression or things expressed) loses all its plausibility (or power of persuasion)&rsquo;. If <foreign lang="greek">οὖν</foreign> be retained, it must be understood (I think) as I have rendered it. There will be no connexion between the clause which it introduces and that which immediately precedes it, and <foreign lang="greek">οὖν</foreign> will be a mere continuative, as in the narrative use of <foreign lang="greek">μὲν οὖν</foreign>&mdash;the <hi rend="italic">inferential</hi>, as with our <hi rend="italic">then</hi>, having degenerated into a <hi rend="italic">temporal</hi> sense, denoting mere continuation or succession. The clause will then be a sort <pb n="80"/> of <hi rend="italic">general</hi> conclusion from all that has been said in this section on the adaptation of delivery to subject-matter. <foreign lang="greek">ἀπίθανον</foreign>, see III 3. 4. </p>

Gr.</hi> Spengel, II 302. 3) <foreign lang="greek">περὶ σφοδρότητος</foreign> (vehemence), quotes a number of instances of this exaggerated language and long compound words from Demosthenes when he was affecting indignation, <foreign lang="greek">ἰαμβειοφάγος</foreign>, de Cor. &sect; 139, <foreign lang="greek">γραμματοκύφων</foreign>, Ib. 209. &ldquo;Nearly the whole of the speech against Aristogeiton,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;is a specimen of this vehement language&rdquo;: and then proceeds to illustrate it from his other writings: [the speeches against Aristogeiton are, however, undoubtedly spurious.] </p>

						<p>This is, as usual, a misquotation; Isocrates wrote, Paneg. &sect; 186, <foreign lang="greek">φήμην δὲ καὶ μνήμην</foreign> (Aristotle ought not to have forgotten this, for it is a striking case of <foreign lang="greek">ὁμοιοτέλευτον</foreign>, or rhyming termination, one of the new figures introduced into Rhetoric by Gorgias and his school): <foreign lang="greek">φήμην δὲ καὶ μνήμην καὶ δόξαν πόσην τινὰ χρὴ νομίζειν ἢ ζῶντας ἕξειν ἢ τελευτήσαντας καταλείψειν τοὺς ἐν τοιούτοις τοῖς ἔργοις ἀριστεύσαντας</foreign>; It is in fact a finely written sentence. </p>

						<p>&lsquo;This also accounts for the fitness of this kind of language for poetry, because poetry is inspired.

						<p>A specimen of Gorgias' irony is found in Ar. Pol.

Whilst Gorgias was in Thessaly, where he seems to have spent a considerable time at Larissa, some Thessalian, who had no doubt heard his boast that he was able and ready to answer any question upon any subject, took him at his word, and asked him what constituted a citizen.&mdash;This is the constitutional question which gives occasion to Aristotle's quotation.&mdash;Partly in jest, and partly because he was really at a loss, he replied, that citizens were made by citizen-manufacturers: as the vessels made by mortarmanufacturers were mortars, so those made by the Larissaean-manufacturers were Larissaean citizens or Larissaeans: for there were such people as <foreign lang="greek">Λαρισσαιοποιοί. Λάρισσα</foreign>, besides the Thessalian city, denotes also some kind of kettle or other cooking-utensil. The reply is much the same as if some one being asked, What makes a citizen of the town of Sandwich? were to answer, &lsquo;a cook, for he is a sandwich-maker&rsquo;; and is no bad specimen of the way in which Gorgias most likely fulfilled his promise of solving any problem whatsoever that was proposed to him. It may be doubted whether, as Schneider supposes, there is also an ambiguity in <foreign lang="greek">δημιουργῶν</foreign>: the word bears also the sense of a magistrate, as the grammarians tell us, especially in Doric states.

					<p>In the paraphrase of the Introduction I have already given an outline of the contents of this chapter and their connexion, with references and some details, pp. 303&mdash;306. And on rhythm in general, and its application to prose, there is an Appendix (C), pp. 379&mdash;392; in which is a full account of its original and derived significations in the first part, and of its distinction from <foreign lang="greek">μέτρον</foreign> in the second. The commentary on this chapter will therefore deal principally with the details of the language, allusions, and such particulars as require explanation, which are omitted in the paraphrase. </p>
					<p>In the fragments of Isocrates' <foreign lang="greek">τέχνη</foreign>, collected by Benseler in the Teubner series, Vol. II p. 276, we have the following, fragm. 4&mdash;cited from <pb n="83"/> Maximus Planudes ad Hermog. and Joannes Siceliotes&mdash;<foreign lang="greek">ὅλως δὲ ὁ λόγος μὴ λόγος ἔστω· ξηρὸν γάρ· μηδὲ ἔμμετρος· καταφανὲς γάρ· ἀλλὰ μεμίχθω παντὶ ῥυθμῷ, μάλιστα ἰαμβικῷ ἢ τροχαϊκῷ</foreign>. The first of these precepts is in entire agreement with Aristotle, &sect; 1; the disagreement of the second with the statements of &sect; 4 is equally striking. It seems from what is said of Thrasymachus and the paean in &sect; 4, that the subject of prosaic rhythm was not included in the <foreign lang="greek">τέχναι</foreign> of himself and the succeeding writers on Rhetoric. It does not appear even in the Rhet. ad Alex. Cicero, de Or. III 44. 173, attributes to Isocrates the first introduction of &lsquo;numbers&rsquo; into prose composition. </p>
					<p>Dionysius de Comp. Verb. c. 25 (p. 197 R.) refers to this chapter of Aristotle in support of his observations on rhythm in prose. His own opinions on the subject are given, pp. 195, 6. </p>
					<p>References are made by Cicero to this chapter (&sect; 4 et seq.), de Or. 1 47. 182, 183, in the course of his dissertation on rhythm, from &sect; 171 foll. The same subject is treated, Orat. c. LXIII 212 seq. The various rhythms heroic, iambic, trochaic, &amp;c. are discussed in c. LXIV, where Aristotle's opinions, as expressed in this chapter, are twice referred to, &sect;&sect; 215, 218. In &sect; 214 we have, temeritas <hi rend="italic">ex tribus brevibus et longa est, quem</hi> (sc. paeanem) <hi rend="italic">Aristoteles ut optimum probat, a quo dissentio.</hi> Cicero is referring to this chapter, from which the other references are taken: and as this is <hi rend="italic">not</hi> found there, he must be either quoting inexactly, from memory, or perhaps confounding Aristotle's opinion on the point with that of one of the other rhetoricians whom he mentions, &sect; 218. There is likewise an incorrectness in the opinion which he there attributes to Aristotle, that the paean is, <hi rend="italic">aptissimus orationi vel orienti vel</hi> mediae: <hi rend="italic">Aristotle</hi> says nothing of the &lsquo;middle&rsquo; of the sentence. </p>
					<p>Compare also, Demetrius <foreign lang="greek">περὶ ἑρμηνείας, περὶ μεγαλοπρεποῦς</foreign>, &sect; 38 seq. (<hi rend="italic">Rhet. Gr.</hi> Spengel, III 270&mdash;273) who also refers thrice to this chapter of the Rhetoric. Quint. IX 4. 45 seq. There are references to this ch. in &sect;&sect; 87, 88. </p>
					<p>On the abuse of rhythm, which degrades and is incompatible with the sublime, there is a short chapter in Dionysius <foreign lang="greek">περὶ ὕψους</foreign>, c. 41. </p>

						<p>&lsquo;The structure (figure, fashion) of the language (i. e. prose composition) should be neither metrical (run into verse)<note anchored="yes">A remarkable instance of this defect in composition is quoted by Twining on Poet., note 36, p. 209, from Dr Smith's <hi rend="italic">System of Optics</hi>&mdash;where, as he truly says, one would least expect to find such a thing&mdash;the beginning of Bk. 1 c. 2 &sect; 47, Where parallel rays Come contrary ways And fall upon opposite sides. This is decidedly more metrical than a parallel instance in one of Dr Whewell's treatises on Mechanics, Hence no force however great, Can stretch a cord however fine, Into an horizontal line, Which is accurately straight [Whewell's <hi rend="italic">Mechanics</hi> 1 p. 44, ed. 1819, <hi rend="italic">Facetiae Cantabrigienses</hi> p. 162].

[For iambic verses in the prose of Isocrates, see Paneg. &sect; 170, <foreign lang="greek">ἐχρῆν γὰρ αὐτοὺς εἴπερ ἦσαν ἄξιοι</foreign> and Spengel's <hi rend="italic">Artium Scriptores</hi>, pp. 152&mdash;4.]</note> nor entirely without measure or rhythm; for the one has no power of persuasion, because it is thought to be artificial (<hi rend="italic">supra</hi>, c. 2. 4, <foreign lang="greek">πεπλασμένως</foreign>), and at the same time <pb n="84"/> also diverts (the hearers' attention, from the main subject or the proof of the fact): for it makes him attend to the recurrence of the similar cadence. And so (the audience anticipate the answering or recurring cadence) just as the children anticipate the answer to the herald's summons, &ldquo;Whom does the freedman choose for his attorney? and the answer is, Cleon&rdquo;&rsquo;. </p>

The children, in the illustration, are so accustomed to the invariable reply to the herald's proclamation, for an attorney or deputy to plead some freedman's cause&mdash;who by law was not allowed to speak for himself in court&mdash; that they have learned to say &lsquo;Cleon&rsquo; whenever the question is asked. It has not been noticed that this story is told in the <hi rend="italic">present</hi> tense, as if the children were in the habit of doing this in Aristotle's own time. Can it be meant that the custom had been handed down from generation to generation for a century or so after Cleon's death? If so, it is a very remarkable fact. </p>

						<p>&lsquo;That (composition) which is (entirely) devoid of rhythm (has no <hi rend="italic">measure</hi>) is indefinite (or, unlimited), but it ought to be limited, only not by metre (like <hi rend="italic">verse</hi>): for the infinite (indefinite, unlimited) is displeasing and (i. e. because it) cannot be known.

						<p>&lsquo;From this it may be inferred that the speech (i. e. prose composition) should have rhythm, but not metre; otherwise it will be a poem <pb n="86"/> (verse-composition). Its rhythm however should not be exactly and nicely finished&rsquo;: (i. e. with exact and systematic accuracy so as to be continuous, and pervade the whole structure of the writing. The description of prose rhythm by Hermogenes, <foreign lang="greek">περὶ ἰδεῶν ά</foreign>, Introd. p. 391, Appendix on <foreign lang="greek">ῥυθμός</foreign>, will serve as a commentary on this and <foreign lang="greek">μέχρι τοῦ</foreign>): &lsquo;and this will be effected if it be only carried up to a certain point (and there stop short; left incomplete and irregular; not finished and systematic, like verse)&rsquo;. </p>

						<p>&lsquo;Of (the three) rhythms, the heroic (hexameter, epic) is (too) stately (or solemn), and deficient in conversational harmony&rsquo;. By using the word &lsquo;harmony&rsquo;, I have left it open whether we are to understand by <foreign lang="greek">ἁρμονία</foreign> &lsquo;harmony&rsquo; in its ordinary musical sense&mdash;in which case the meaning will be &lsquo;that particular kind of harmony which is adapted to ordinary conversation&rsquo;, the language of common life, and <hi rend="italic">inferior</hi> to that of the heroic rhythm&mdash;a somewhat non-natural interpretation; or in the primary, more general sense of the word, &lsquo;an adaptation or fitting of parts into an organized whole&rsquo;, which with <foreign lang="greek">λεκτικῆς</foreign> will signify &lsquo;deficient in conversational structure&rsquo;, in an adaptation of parts fitted for conversation (Dionysius uses <foreign lang="greek">ἁρμονία</foreign> as equivalent to <foreign lang="greek">λέξις</foreign>, for style of <hi rend="italic">composition</hi>); the iambic is the very language of the vulgar, and therefore of all measures the iambic is most frequently uttered in common speech (or conversation); but it wants (the acquisition of, <foreign lang="greek">γενέσθαι</foreign>) solemnity and dignity and the power (or faculty) of <hi rend="italic">striking.</hi> The trochaic is too farcical (has too much of the comic dance about it; reminds one of its indecency and buffoonery<note anchored="yes">This may <hi rend="italic">possibly</hi> be included in the meaning of the word <hi rend="italic">here</hi>: but if so, it is quite subordinate.

See further on the doctrine and ratios of rhythm, in the Appendix on that subject, Introd. p. 387, foll. where the statements of the following sections are illustrated. The epithet <foreign lang="greek">σεμνός</foreign> has been already applied to it in III 3. 3; Dionysius, de Isocr.

Verb. c. 18 (p. 109, Reiske), the exact opposite; <foreign lang="greek">δακτυλικὸς πάνυ ἐστὶ σεμνὸς καὶ εἰς κάλλος ἁρμονίας ἀξιολογώτατος</foreign>. Victorius, from Demetrius, <foreign lang="greek">περὶ ἑρμηνείας</foreign> &sect; 42, read <foreign lang="greek">ὁ μὲν ἡρῷος σεμνὸς καὶ οὐ λογικός</foreign>, which leaves <foreign lang="greek">ἁρμονίας δεόμενος</foreign> to explain itself as it best may.

						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ἴαμβος.. ἡ λέξις ἡ τῶν πολλῶν</lemma>] This has been already noticed, III 1. 9, and twice in Poet. XXII. 19.

						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ἐκστῆσαι</lemma>] is used here in a much milder sense than its ordinary one, to strike, excite, <hi rend="italic">mettre hors de soi</hi>, to displace or remove a man out of his ordinary state of feeling, to a higher one of excitement: whereas in this metaphorical application, it usually implies a much more violent emotion than mere admiration or amusement, as Demosth. c. Mid. 537 ult., <foreign lang="greek">ταῦτα κινεῖ, ταῦτα ἐξίστησιν ἀνθρώπους αὐτῶν</foreign>, &lsquo;drives men besides themselves, drives them mad&rsquo;. Eur.

Suidas <foreign lang="greek">κορδακίζει· αἰσχρὰ ὀρχεῖται</foreign> (the rest as Harpocr.). The characteristics of the <foreign lang="greek">κόρδαξ</foreign>, a <hi rend="italic">kind</hi> of Comic dance, may be gathered from notices in Theophr. Char. 6, <foreign lang="greek">περὶ ἀπονοίας</foreign>, &lsquo;desperate recklessness&rsquo;, where it is a mark of this character to dance the cordax sober and without a mask: in Aristophanes, who takes credit to himself, Nub. 540, for never introducing it into his comedies: in Athenaeus, XIV 28, ult. 630 E, who calls it <foreign lang="greek">παιγνιώδης</foreign>, &lsquo;sportive&rsquo;. Dem. Olynth. II &sect; 18 (of Philip's mode of life), <foreign lang="greek">εἰ δέ τις σώφρων ἢ δίκαιος ἄλλως, τὴν καθ’  ἡμέραν ἀκρασίαν τοῦ βίου καὶ μέθην καὶ κορδακισμοὺς οὐ δυνάμενος φέρειν κ.τ.λ.</foreign> It seems therefore to have been accompanied by the grossest indecencies, so that no respectable person could allow himself even to look on the performance of it. See further in M&uuml;ller, <hi rend="italic">Hist. Gr. Lit.</hi> XXVII 7. </p>
						<p>This however is not the point of the reference here. But the <foreign lang="greek">κόρδαξ</foreign> <pb n="88"/> was accompanied by verses in the trochaic tetrameter, and these are identified; and all that is implied here by the term is the lightness, the want of gravity and dignity, and the <hi rend="italic">dancing</hi> tripping measure, afterwards expressed by <foreign lang="greek">τροχερός</foreign>; as we see also in the passages of Cic. and Quint. This character always belonged to the tetrameter; and hence we are told that the dithyrambs, from which Tragedy took its rise, were originally written in this measure, which was afterwards exchanged for the iambic, the metre nearest to the language of ordinary conversation, when the <hi rend="italic">dialogue</hi> had been introduced, and Tragedy assumed a regular form. <foreign lang="greek">Τό τε μέτρον</foreign> (of Tragedy) <foreign lang="greek">ἐκ τετραμέτρου ἰαμβεῖον ἐγένετο· τὸ μὲν γὰρ πρῶτον τετραμέτρῳ ἐχρῶντο διὰ τὸ σατυρικὴν καὶ ὀρχηστικωτέραν εἶναι τὴν ποίησιν, λέξεως δὲ γενομένης αὐτὴ ἡ φύσις τὸ οἰκεῖον μέτρον εὗρεν· μάλιστα γὰρ λεκτικὸν τῶν μέτρων τὸ ἰαμβεῖόν ἐστιν</foreign> (Poet. IV 19). Comp. Rhet. III 1. 9. </p>
						<p>These rhythms being set aside, (they are in fact reducible to two, the proportions 1 : 1, and 2 : 1, iambus and trochee, &breve;-and -&breve; respectively) the third &lsquo;the paean remains, the use of which began with Thrasymachus, though he and his followers couldn't tell what it was (did not know how to define it). The paean<note anchored="yes">Aristotle writes <foreign lang="greek">παιάν</foreign>: Cicero, <hi rend="italic">paean</hi> in the Orator, and <hi rend="italic">paeon</hi> in the de Oratore: Quintilian, <hi rend="italic">paeon.</hi></note> is the third (of the rhythms) and closely connected with the preceding: for it has the ratio of three to two (3/2 : 1, three short, and one long syllable equal to two short), whilst the others have that of one to one (dactyl, spondee, anapaest), and two to one (iambus and trochee), severally. And one and a half (3/2 : 1, the ratio of the paean) is connected with these (two) ratios [&lsquo;next to&rsquo; both ratios, i. e. the mean between the two extremes, 1 : 1 and 2 : 1], and that is the paean&rsquo;. On this see Introd. Appendix on <foreign lang="greek">ῥυθμός</foreign>, pp. 387, 8. The paeonic ratio includes also the bacchius and cretic. These three ratios are the <foreign lang="greek">βάσεις</foreign> of the three measures. </p>

						<p>&lsquo;Now all the rest (of the <foreign lang="greek">ῥυθμοί</foreign>) are to be discarded, not only for the reasons already mentioned, but also because they are metrical (too suggestive of the cadence of regular verse): but the paean is to be adopted: for it is the only one of the rhythms named which cannot be made into a regular verse, and therefore (the use of it) is most likely to escape detection&rsquo;. <foreign lang="greek">ἀπὸ μόνου γάρ κ.τ.λ.</foreign>, that is, it is an element of rhythm, not metre. Hermann, <hi rend="italic">Elem. doctr. metr.</hi> II 19, de vers. Cret. (near the beginning of the chapter), has a criticism of this passage which <pb n="89"/> he quotes, attributing to the author a misconception of the nature of the paeonic measure, which has caused him to fall into the error of denying it to be a metre<note anchored="yes">Though I cannot see much force in <hi rend="italic">Hermann's</hi> argument against Aristotle, yet it must be owned that it is odd to deny that to be metrical, which derived its very name from the hymns to Apollo which were principally written in that measure, as may be seen from the two specimens here quoted.</note>. See Cic. Orator, &sect; 194, <hi rend="italic">paean autem minime est aptus ad versum;</hi> and the whole section. Also &sect; 218, <hi rend="italic">numerus a quibusdam</hi> (Aristotle, no doubt), <hi rend="italic">non pes habetur.</hi> &lsquo;At present the one (form of) paean is employed (at the end) as well as at the beginning (of the sentence), but the end ought to be different to the beginning&rsquo;. Vater proposed to supply <foreign lang="greek">τελευτῶντες</foreign> before <foreign lang="greek">καὶ ἀρχόμενοι</foreign>: but in a writer like Aristotle the supplement or opposite may be very well supposed to be <hi rend="italic">implied</hi> in the <foreign lang="greek">καί</foreign>. </p>

						<p>&lsquo;There are two kinds of paean opposed to one another, of which the one is suitable at the beginning (of the sentence or period), as in fact it is employed: and this is the one which begins with the long (syllable), and ends with three short. <foreign lang="greek">Δαλογενὲς εἴτε Λυκίαν</foreign>, &ldquo;O Delosborn, or if perchance Lycia&rdquo; (were thy birthplace). The poet, whose alternative is cut short by the inexorable brevity of the quotation, was doubtless going on, as the manner of the ancient poets is, to offer the deity whom he was addressing the choice of the various titles under which he was known and worshipped, expressive of place of birth, special character or office: which was done to avoid the possibility of giving offence by omitting any title of honour of which he might be specially proud. The following specimens of a very frequent custom will suffice to illustrate it. Hor. Carm. Sec. line 14, <hi rend="italic">Lenis Ilithya... sive tu Lucina probas vocari seu Genitalis.</hi> Sat. II 6. 20, <hi rend="italic">Matutine pater, seu Iane libentius audis.</hi> [We may also compare Horace's enumeration of the favourite haunts of Apollo, <hi rend="italic">qui rore puro Castaliae lavit crines solutos, qui Lyciae tenet dumeta natalemque silvam Delius et Patareus Apollo.</hi> Od. III 4. 61.] <foreign lang="greek">Ζεύς, ὅστις ποτ’  ἐστίν, εἰ τόδ̓ αὐτῷ φίλον κεκλημένῳ, τοῦτό νιν προσεννέπω</foreign>. Agam. 147. The author of the paean was apparently about to add after <foreign lang="greek">Λυκίαν, νέμων</foreign> or some such word, offering the god the alternative birthplace of Lycia, if he happened to prefer it. The Homeric epithet <foreign lang="greek">Λυκηγένης</foreign>, Il. <foreign lang="greek">Δ</foreign> 101, 119, is usually supposed to denote his Lycian birthplace, Patara, though M&uuml;ller, <hi rend="italic">Dor.</hi> II 6. 8, would &ldquo;rather understand&rdquo; by it &lsquo;born of light&rsquo;. On the epithet <foreign lang="greek">Λύκειος</foreign>, frequently applied to Apollo by the Tragedians, as Aesch. Suppl. 668 (with Paley's note), Sept. c. Theb. 133, Agam. 1228, Soph. Oed. R. 203 (Schneidewin), Electr. 6, &amp;c. &amp;c., see M&uuml;ller's <hi rend="italic">Dorians</hi>, II 6. 8, where the various significations of Apollo's titles are discussed at length; and Donaldson's <hi rend="italic">New Cratylus</hi> &sect; 269, on the connexion of <foreign lang="greek">λύκος</foreign> with <pb n="90"/> <foreign lang="greek">λευκός</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">-λύκη</foreign>. [In G. Curtius' <hi rend="italic">Greek Etymology</hi>, &sect; 88 <foreign lang="greek">λευκός</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">ἀμφιλύκη</foreign>, and &sect; 89 <foreign lang="greek">λύκος</foreign>, no such connexion is suggested.] </p>
						<p>Brandis' &lsquo;Anonymus&rsquo; [<hi rend="italic">Philologus</hi> IV. I] reads &ldquo;<foreign lang="greek">Δαλογενές, εἶτα, Λύκιε ἑκάεργε</foreign>. </p>
						<p>Victorius has noted that this and the following quotation are both commencements of paeans to Apollo, from which the name of the metre is derived: and each of them exemplifies the &lsquo;paean at the beginning&rsquo;. </p>
						<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Golden-haired Archer son of Zeus&rdquo;. The other, the opposite to this, in which three short syllables form the beginning, and the long one comes at the end. &ldquo;After earth and its waters, night obscured (blotted out) ocean&rdquo;&rsquo;. In the Greek line there are four pure paeans, all of this construction &breve;&breve;&breve;-: but Ar. appears to quote it as an exemplification only of this form of paean in the last place of the verse, or rhythm. </p>

But the ellipse of <foreign lang="greek">ὁδός</foreign>, in one or other of its cases, is very much more common than that of <foreign lang="greek">χώρα</foreign> or <foreign lang="greek">ἀρχή</foreign>, in the formation of adverbs and quasi-adverbs in the feminine, genitive, dative and accusative; such as <foreign lang="greek">ᾗ τῇ ταύτῃ τῇδε ἐκείνῃ ἄλλῃ</foreign> et sim.&mdash;a large number of instances of these three varieties of the ellipse of <foreign lang="greek">ὁδός</foreign> is collected under that head in the work referred to, pp. 188&mdash;192; and at p. 192 init. <foreign lang="greek">ἐπ’  ἐναντίας φέρεσθαι</foreign> is rightly inserted among them by Leisner (one of the earlier editors). </p>
						<p>&lsquo;And this makes a (true and proper) end: for&rsquo; (<foreign lang="greek">γάρ</foreign>: the reason of this, that the long syllable <hi rend="italic">is</hi> required for the end, may be inferred from the consideration that follows of the incompleteness, &amp;c. of the <hi rend="italic">short</hi> syllable) &lsquo;the short syllable by reason of its incompleteness makes (the rhythm appear) mutilated (cut prematurely short)&rsquo;. Cic. Orator, &sect;&sect; 214, 215, 218, u. s. <pb n="91"/> </p>

						<p>&lsquo;But the (sentence or period) should be broken off (brought <hi rend="italic">abruptly</hi> to a close) and the end marked by the long syllable&mdash;not (however) by the scribe (or copyist), nor by a marginal annotation (marking the end of the sentence), but by the measure itself&rsquo;. <foreign lang="greek">διά</foreign> with the accusative, which indicates the cause or motive, (not the medium, channel or means, which is <foreign lang="greek">διά</foreign> with genitive,) here implies that the indication of the end of the sentence should not be <hi rend="italic">due</hi> to the scribe or his marks, stops, or what not, but solely to the rhythm: that the end should appear by the abrupt close of <hi rend="italic">that.</hi> </p>
						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">παραγραφή</lemma>, a by-writing, or marginal annotation. That these were occasionally <hi rend="italic">stops</hi> appears from our use of the word &lsquo;paragraph&rsquo;: just as the words that we use for <hi rend="italic">stops</hi>, comma, colon, period, originally represented members of the period or the whole period itself. Victorius aptly quotes, Cic. Orat. c. LXVIII &sect; 228 (already referred to), <hi rend="italic">quod ait Aristoteles et Theophrastus, ne infinite feratur ut flumen oratio, quae non aut spiritu pronunciantis aut</hi> interductu librarii, <hi rend="italic">sed numero coacta debet insistere.</hi> And to the same effect de Orat. III 44. 173, where the <hi rend="italic">librariorum notae</hi> are again mentioned. Victorius also cites Isocr.

					<p>We now come to another kind of <foreign lang="greek">ἁρμονία</foreign>, the adaptation of the several parts of the sentence to one another in order to its fit composition (<hi rend="italic">apta compositio</hi>, Cic. [de Orat. III 52. 200]), shewn in the arrangement of its words and subordinate clauses. The subject of the chapter is accordingly the period and its construction; and some of its leading figures&mdash;those originally introduced by Gorgias and his school&mdash;are illustrated by several examples from Isocrates' Panegyricus. <pb n="92"/> </p>
					<p>Of the two principal varieties of style, the <foreign lang="greek">εἰρόμενη</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">κατεστραμμένη λέξις</foreign>, the latter more usually called <foreign lang="greek">περιοδική</foreign>, the style of Demosthenes, Isocrates, and the more finished rhetoricians, there is a detailed account in the Introduction, in the analysis of this chapter, p. 306 seq. So that we may at once pass on to the translation, and the particular points of interest and difficulty that the text offers. On Dionysius' distinction of three varieties of style, see p. 306, note 4. On the <foreign lang="greek">εἰρομένη λέξις</foreign>, the earlier style of Hecataeus, Herodotus and the <foreign lang="greek">λογογράφοι</foreign>, see p. 307, and 306, note 5; and on <foreign lang="greek">ἀναβολαί</foreign>, to which this style of prose is compared, p. 307 note 1. The opposite style, <foreign lang="greek">ἡ κατεστραμμένη</foreign>, is described at length, pp. 308&mdash;310. See Ernesti, <hi rend="italic">Lex. Techn. Gr.</hi> s. v. <foreign lang="greek">συστρέφειν</foreign>. For a good description of both, following Aristotle, see Demetr. <foreign lang="greek">περὶ ἑρμηνείας</foreign> &sect; 12. </p>
					<div3 id="b3c9s1" type="section" n="1">
						<p>&lsquo;The style must be either <hi rend="italic">loose and concatenated</hi>&rsquo; (the sentences loosely strung together, connected solely by connecting particles, as <foreign lang="greek">δέ, καί</foreign>, like onions on a string) &lsquo;and one only by the connecting particle, like the preludes in the dithyrambs, or <hi rend="italic">close and compact</hi> (i. e. periodic) and resembling the (regular) antistrophes of the old lyric poets&rsquo;, Pindar Arion, Stesichorus, and the like. The last of the three is said to have owed his new name of Stesichorus&mdash;his original name was Tisias&mdash;to his having been the first to bring the chorus to a stand, make it stationary, for a time at least; and give it order, regularity, symmetry, and dignity. This is also attributed to Arion. </p>

					<div3 id="b3c9s2" type="section" n="2">
						<p>&lsquo;Now the loose style is the ancient (original) one. &ldquo;This is the setting forth of the researches of Herodotus of Thurii.&rdquo; This style which was formerly universal is now confined to a few. By <hi rend="italic">loose</hi> I mean that which has no end in itself except the completion of the subject under discussion. And it is displeasing by reason of its endlessness (or <hi rend="italic">indefinite</hi> length or character, <hi rend="italic">supra</hi> c. 8. 2); for every one desires to have the end distinctly in view&rsquo;. Quintilian, VIII 5. 27, thus describes the <foreign lang="greek">εἰρομένη λέξις</foreign>, <hi rend="italic">soluta fere oratio, et e singulis non membris sed frustis collata, structura caret.</hi> Cicero, Or. LV 186, notices the want of &lsquo;numbers&rsquo; in Herodotus and his predecessors: which may possibly include the periodic structure of sentences; as Aristotle does, <hi rend="italic">infra</hi> &sect; 3, <foreign lang="greek">ἀριθμὸν ἔχει ἡ ἐν περιόδοις λέξις</foreign>. </p>
						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">Ἡροδότου Θουρίου</lemma>] This appears to be the reading of all MSS, except that A^{c} has <foreign lang="greek">θυρίου</foreign>. Herodotus did actually join the colony established at Thurium in 443 (Clinton, <hi rend="italic">F. H.</hi> sub anno 443, col. 3), and was thence sometimes called a Thurian from this his second birthplace. So Strabo, XIV c. 2, (Caria,) p. 657, of Halicarnassus; <foreign lang="greek">ἄνδρες δὲ γεγόνασιν ἐξ αὐτῆς Ἡρόδοτός τε ὁ συγγραφεύς, ὃν ὕστερον Θούριον ἐκάλεσαν, διὰ τὸ κοινωνῆσαι τῆς εἰς Θουρίους ἀποικίας</foreign>. Plut. de <pb n="93"/> exilio, c. 13, <foreign lang="greek">τὸ δέ, Ἡροδότου Ἁλικαρνασσέως ἱστορίης ἀπόδειξις ἥδε, πολλοὶ μεταγράφουσι, Ἡροδότου Θουρίου. μετῴκησε γὰρ εἰς Θουρίους, καὶ τῆς ἀποικίας ἐκείνης μέτεσχε</foreign>. Id. de Herodoti malignitate c. 35, <foreign lang="greek">καὶ ταῦτα, Θούριον μὲν ὑπὸ τῶν ἄλλων νομιζόμενον, αὐτὸν δὲ Ἁλικαρνασσέων περιεχόμενον</foreign>. The second of these passages may be interpreted to mean, that the reading in Plutarch's time was often found altered <hi rend="italic">in the copies of Herodotus' history</hi>, from <foreign lang="greek">Ἁλικαρνασσέως</foreign> to <foreign lang="greek">Θουρίου</foreign>; and if so, no doubt Aristotle's copy <hi rend="italic">may</hi> have had that reading, which he transferred to his Rhetoric. But on the other hand, Demetrius, <foreign lang="greek">περὶ ἑρμηνείας</foreign>, &sect; 17 (<foreign lang="greek">περὶ περιόδου</foreign>), in quoting the same passage, follows the reading of all our MSS <foreign lang="greek">Ἡροδότου Ἁλικαρνασσῆος ἱστορίης ἀπόδεξις ἥδε</foreign>. Which, together with two other inaccuracies of quotation (in the Rhet.), the transposition of <foreign lang="greek">ἥδε</foreign>, and the writing <foreign lang="greek">ἀπόδειξις</foreign> for <foreign lang="greek">ἀπόδεξις</foreign>&mdash;Demetr. preserves the correct form&mdash;leads me rather to conclude that the variation from our text is due here, as we have already seen in so many other instances, to our author's carelessness in quoting from memory, without referring to the original. Aristotle was a book-collector, and no doubt <hi rend="italic">possessed</hi> a copy of Herodotus. Victorius thinks that the reading here is sufficiently justified by the fact that Herodotus did actually become a citizen of Thurii, and was so called. But the point here to be decided is not whether he was ever so called by others, or even by himself at odd times; but whether he did, or did not, write himself a Thurian at the commencement of his own history: which I deny, and attribute the implied assertion of that fact as a mere misquotation to our author himself. </p>
						<p>&lsquo;And this is why it is only at the goal that (the runners) pant (or gasp) and become faint, because whilst they are looking forward to the limit of the race they don't flag before that (i. e. before they have reached the goal)&rsquo;. This, as I have said in Introd. p. 311, note, seems the explanation of the illustration which is required by the application of it and by the context. The sight of the goal before them, the term of their labour, keeps up the racers' spirits and stimulates their exertions, so that they neither faint nor fail till they reach it: <hi rend="italic">then</hi> <foreign lang="greek">ἐκπνέουσι καὶ ἐκλύονται</foreign>, they breathe hard, and their exertions being over, their sinews are relaxed, they slacken and grow languid. This interpretation, which is opposed to that of Victorius (see note u.s.), makes the <foreign lang="greek">καμπτήρ</foreign>, which is properly the <hi rend="italic">turning-point</hi> of the <foreign lang="greek">δίαυλος</foreign>&mdash;whence its name&mdash;<hi rend="italic">here</hi> the <hi rend="italic">goal</hi> of the <foreign lang="greek">στάδιον</foreign> or single race, in a straight line: the <foreign lang="greek">καμπτήρ</foreign> of the <foreign lang="greek">δίαυλος</foreign> being in fact the <foreign lang="greek">πέρας</foreign> of the <foreign lang="greek">στάδιον</foreign>. If the <foreign lang="greek">καμπτήρ</foreign> were intended here for the turning-point, the statement made of it could not be true, for in that case the runners would not come in sight of the goal until they had <hi rend="italic">passed</hi> the <foreign lang="greek">καμπτήρ</foreign>. So in Eth. N. V. 1. 2, 1095 <hi rend="italic">b</hi> 1, an illusration is borrowed from the <hi rend="italic">single foot-race</hi>, the <foreign lang="greek">στάδιον; ὥσπερ ἐν τῷ</foreign> <pb n="94"/> <foreign lang="greek">σταδίῳ ἀπὸ τῶν ἀθλοθετῶν ἐπὶ τὸ πέρας ἢ ἀνάπαλιν</foreign> (to illustrate the Platonic <foreign lang="greek">ἀπὸ τῶν ἀρχῶν ἢ ἐπὶ τὰς ἀρχάς</foreign>). And similarly the Tragic poets express reaching the term or end of life by <foreign lang="greek">κάμπειν</foreign>, which seems to imply the necessity of this explanation. Soph. Oed. Col. 91, <foreign lang="greek">ἐνταῦθα κͅάμψειν τὸν ταλαίπωρον βίον</foreign>. Eur. Hel. 1666, <foreign lang="greek">ὅταν δὲ κάμψῃς καὶ τελευτήσῃς βίον</foreign>.

It occurred to me that <foreign lang="greek">εἶναι</foreign>, which seems superfluous, might have arisen from a repetition of the <foreign lang="greek">εῖν</foreign> in <foreign lang="greek">προνοεῖν</foreign>.

The proportions, or relations of the several parts or members of the period to the whole, and to one another&mdash;its symmetrical structure&mdash;can be expressed in numbers, like the numerical relations of rhythm, c. 8. This gives the periodic structure a hold upon the memory, by its definite proportions, which is entirely wanting to the continuous and indefinite succession of the other. </p>

Gr.</hi> II 270). The second verse, which completes the author's meaning, is supplied by Lucian, Conv. c. 25 (Hemsterh. III. 436), and Demetr. <foreign lang="greek">περὶ ἑρμηνείας</foreign> &sect; 58 (<hi rend="italic">Rhet. Gr.</hi> Spengel III 275), <foreign lang="greek">ἐν ἀντιπόρθμοις πέδἰ ἔχους’  εὐδαίμονα</foreign>: and the three following by Wagner, u. s. This makes it clear that this misstatement was not due to Euripides. As to the substitution of Sophocles for Euripides as the author, I have no doubt, from the abundant evidence we have already had, that it is due solely to a lapse of memory on Ar.'s part, and that no alteration of the text, as suggested by Vater and Buhle, is required. </p>
						<p>The <hi rend="italic">stop</hi>, or <hi rend="italic">pause</hi>, which the speaker or reader makes, when introduced in the wrong place, may make a complete alteration in the meaning: as here, if the verse be read as an entire sentence with the pause at <foreign lang="greek">χθονός</foreign>, it conveys the meaning that Calydon is situated in the Peloponnesus, which is contrary to the fact: but if it be read continuously without a pause with the ensuing line, the true sense becomes clear. <foreign lang="greek">διαιρεῖσθαι</foreign> here is equivalent to <foreign lang="greek">διαστίξαι</foreign> III 5. 6, comp. Anon. ap. Brandis, p. 47, <foreign lang="greek">οἷά εἰσι κατὰ σύνθεσιν καὶ διαίρεσιν, καὶ ἐνταῦθα μὲν διαστίξαντες ἄλλην διάνοιαν ἀπαρτίσομεν, ἐνταῦθα δὲ διαστίξαντες ἄλλην</foreign>. This is in fact the &lsquo;fallacy of division&rsquo;, de Soph. El. 4, 166 <hi rend="italic">a</hi> 33, <foreign lang="greek">παρὰ τὴν διαίρεσιν</foreign>, where two verses are quoted in illustration. </p>
						<p>Demetrius u.s. quotes the two verses in illustration of a different kind of fault; the interpolation of a <foreign lang="greek">σύνδεσμος</foreign>&mdash;in which he includes <hi rend="italic">interjections</hi>&mdash;by actors, as an <hi rend="italic">expletive.</hi> <foreign lang="greek">Οἱ δὲ πρὸς οὐδὲν ἀναπληροῦντες, φησί, τὸν σύνδεσμον ἐοίκασι τοῖς ὑποκριταῖς τοῖς τὸ καὶ τὸ πρὸς οὐδὲν ἔπος λέγουσιν, οἷον εἴ τις ὧδε λέγοι, Καλυδὼν μὲν ἥδε γαῖα Πελοπείας χθονός, φεῦ, ἐν ἀντιπόρθμοις πέδἰ ἔχους’  εὐδαίμονα, αἴ αἴ. ὡς γὰρ παρέλκει τὸ αἴ αἴ καὶ τὸ φεῦ ἐνθάδε, οὕτω καὶ ὁ πανταχοῦ μάτην ἐμβαλλόμενος σύνδεσμος</foreign>. </p>
						<p>The MSS, with the exception of A^{c}, have <foreign lang="greek">Πελοπείας</foreign>, which is found also in Demetrius and retained by Bekker and Spengel; MS A^{c}, Lucian, the Schol. on Aristophanes, Dindorf (<hi rend="italic">Eur. Fragm.</hi> Mel. 2), and Wagner, read the more usual form <foreign lang="greek">Πελοπίας</foreign>. The text of Euripides, who alone of the <pb n="97"/> three Tragedians uses the word, has <foreign lang="greek">Πελόπιος</foreign> in five places, including the line of the Meleager (Beck's Index). </p>

						<p>&lsquo;A period may be either divided into clauses, or simple (confined to one)&rsquo;. Ar. himself defines what he means here by <foreign lang="greek">ἀφελής</foreign>, viz. <foreign lang="greek">μονόκωλος</foreign>, a sentence consisting of a single member, without the complication, or elaborate construction of the period. <foreign lang="greek">ἀφελής</foreign> properly denotes smooth and level, without inequalities or irregularities, as Arist. Eq. 527, <foreign lang="greek">διὰ τῶν ἀφελῶν πεδίων ἔῤῥει</foreign>. It is therefore &lsquo;plain&rsquo; as opposed to &lsquo;mountainous&rsquo;, literally and metaphorically, level, easy to be traversed, simple, <hi rend="italic">plain;</hi> whereas the mountain is suggestive of difficulty. It is applied by Dionysius, de admirabili vi dicendi in Demosthene [c. 2], to Lysias' style, which is said to be <foreign lang="greek">λιτὴ καὶ ἀφελής</foreign>, &lsquo;smooth and plain or simple&rsquo;. Lysias' style is in fact a medium between the <foreign lang="greek">εἰρομένη λέξις</foreign> of Hecataeus and Herodotus, and the complex periods of Isocrates and Demosthenes: and a comparison of the sentences of Lysias with those of Demosthenes will clearly shew the difference between the <foreign lang="greek">ἀφελής</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">ἡ ἐν κώλοις περίοδος</foreign>. Quint. IX 4. 124, 12. 5. <hi rend="italic">Genera eius</hi> (periodi) <hi rend="italic">duo sunt: alterum simplex, quum sensus unus longiore ambitu circumducitur; alterum, quod constat membris</hi> (<foreign lang="greek">ἐν κώλοις</foreign>) <hi rend="italic">et incisis, quae plures sensus habent.

						<p>&lsquo;The period in clauses or divisions must be complete in itself, duly divided (its members distinct and definite), and such as can be easily delivered without stopping to draw breath&rsquo; (<hi rend="italic">lit.</hi> easily breathed, well adapted to the limits of the breath). </p>

						<p>&lsquo;Not however (<foreign lang="greek">μή</foreign>, if, provided, it be not) by the mere (arbitrary) division (as if the speaker might pause for breath, <hi rend="italic">wherever he pleases</hi>,) as (in) the period already cited (<foreign lang="greek">Καλυδὼν μὲν ἥδε</foreign>...), but as a whole. A member or clause is one of the two parts of this. By <hi rend="italic">simple</hi> I mean a period of a single member&rsquo;. It appears from this that a period, according to Ar., is a sentence that includes a <hi rend="italic">complete sense</hi><note anchored="yes">So Hermog. <foreign lang="greek">περὶ εὑρέσεως τομ. δ́, περὶ περιόδου</foreign> (II 241 <hi rend="italic">Rh. Gr.</hi> Spengel), of the <foreign lang="greek">κῶλον</foreign>. The period may consist of one, two, three or four, colons. <foreign lang="greek">κῶλον δέ ἐστιν ἀπηρτισμένη διάνοια</foreign>, a complete sense. Aristotle admits this <hi rend="italic">only</hi> of the <foreign lang="greek">μονόκωλος περίοδος</foreign>.</note>, and is thereby distinguished from a <foreign lang="greek">κῶλον</foreign> or member of it: which <hi rend="italic">is</hi> a member or part of a whole, and therefore incomplete until the whole has been expressed. The period therefore is twofold, simple, <foreign lang="greek">μονόκωλος</foreign>, and compound, <foreign lang="greek">ἐν κώλοις</foreign>. The phrase <foreign lang="greek">τὸ ἕτερον μόριον</foreign> divides the compound period primarily or essentially into <hi rend="italic">two</hi> parts, which stands for, and may be extended to, division in general. Cicero, as Vater <pb n="98"/> observes, acknowledges the compound alone to be a true period. <foreign lang="greek">Τὸ δὲ κῶλον Ἀριστοτέλης οὕτως ὁρίζεται, κῶλόν ἐστι τὸ ἕτερον μέρος περιόδου· εἶτα ἐπιφέρει, γίνεται δὲ καὶ ἁπλῆ περίοδος. οὕτως ὁρισάμενος τὸ ἕτερον μέρος δίκωλον ἐβούλετο εἶναι τὴν περίοδον δηλονότι. ὁ δὲ Ἀρχέδημος συλλαβὼν τὸν ὅρον τοῦ Ἀρ., καὶ τὸ ἐπιφερόμενον τῷ ὅρῳ σαφέστερον καὶ τελεώτερον οὕτως ὡρίσατο, κῶλόν ἐστιν ἤτοι ἁπλῆ περιόδος, ἢ συνθέτου περιόδου μέρος</foreign> [Demetrius <foreign lang="greek">π. ἑρμηνείας</foreign>, &sect; 34].

						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">μυούρους</lemma>] This word is variously written <foreign lang="greek">μυ-</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">μεί-ουρος</foreign>, and so here the MSS. The Lexicons, including Stephens', regard them as two different words: Stephens only distinguishing the <hi rend="italic">sense</hi>, <foreign lang="greek">μείουρος, κολόβουρος</foreign>, bob-tailed, with a stunted tail; <foreign lang="greek">μύουρος</foreign>, sharp-tailed, like a mouse: while Liddell and Scott, and Rost and Palm, deriving <foreign lang="greek">μύουρος</foreign> from a mouse's tail, set the facts of the case at defiance by defining it nevertheless &lsquo;curtailed&rsquo;, &lsquo;<hi rend="italic">abgestutzt oder abgestumpft</hi>&rsquo;. This at all events is no doubt the meaning of it. It seems to me rather that the word is the same, and the variety only in the spelling. The meaning of it is always the same; bob-tailed, curtailed, originally; and thence blunted, truncated, docked, maimed, cut <hi rend="italic">short</hi> where you would naturally expect a prolongation. Comp. Poet. c. XXVI 13, <foreign lang="greek">ἐὰν μὲν ἕνα τὸν μῦθον ποιῶσιν ἀνάγκη ἢ βραχέα δεικνύμενον μύουρον φαίνεσθαι</foreign>, unnaturally, unduly, curtailed. See Twining's note, p. 557. He refers to Hephaest. <foreign lang="greek">μείουρος στίχος, ὁ κατὰ τὸ τέλος ἐλλείπων χρόνῳ</foreign>, opposed to <foreign lang="greek">δολίχουρος</foreign>, &lsquo;long-tailed&rsquo;, <foreign lang="greek">ὁ κατὰ τὸ τέλος πλεονάζων συλλαβῇ</foreign>. Comp. de part. Anim.

And again IV 13. 22, the same remark is repeated. Pausanias, X 16. 1, describing one of Croesus' offerings at Delphi, <foreign lang="greek">σχῆμα δὲ τοῦ ὑποθήματος κατὰ πύργον μάλιστα ἐς μύουρον ἀνιόντα ἀπὸ εὐρυτέρου τοῦ κάτῳ</foreign>, of a truncated cone or pyramid. Athenaeus (XIV 632 D, E, <hi rend="italic">ter</hi>,) of three kinds of defective verses; <foreign lang="greek">ἀκέφαλοι</foreign>, at the beginning, as a verse beginning with <foreign lang="greek">ἐπειδή;</foreign> <foreign lang="greek">λαγαροί</foreign>, prop. spider-shaped, contracted or weak in the flanks; hence of verses, faulty in the middle (<hi rend="italic">claudicant in medio</hi> Schweigha&uuml;ser ad loc.), where a short syllable occurs for a long one in the middle of the verse: illustrated by Il. B [II] 731, and another hexameter which Schweigha&uuml;ser can't find, and to him is inexplicable; and thirdly <foreign lang="greek">μείουροι, οἱ ἐπὶ τῆς ἐκβολῆς</foreign>, at the end of the verse; of which three specimens are given, Il. M [XII] 208, another which <pb n="99"/> is misquoted from Il. <foreign lang="greek">Θ</foreign> [VIII] 305, and a third from Od. <foreign lang="greek">ί</foreign> [IX] 212. This passage of Athenaeus is quoted at length by Hermann, <hi rend="italic">El. doctr. metr.</hi> II 26. 20. Athenaeus writes <foreign lang="greek">μείουρος</foreign>. Ernesti <hi rend="italic">Lex. Techn. Gr.</hi> s. v. <foreign lang="greek">μείουρος</foreign>. </p>
						<p>&lsquo;For that (sc. the <foreign lang="greek">κῶλον</foreign>) which is too short often makes the listener stumble (<hi rend="italic">balks</hi> him by bringing him up short and abruptly); because if, whilst he is still hurrying (eager) to get on (forward), and to the (end or completion of the) measure (rhythm), of which he has already a definition (i.e. a definite and preconceived notion) in himself, he be suddenly pulled up (checked, <hi rend="italic">lit.</hi> pulled against) by a pause (a premature cessation on the part of the speaker), there must necessarily follow (arise <foreign lang="greek">γίγνεσθαι</foreign>) a sort of stumble by reason of the check&rsquo;. </p>
						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">προσπταίειν</lemma>] must be regarded as a subst. in the accusative before <foreign lang="greek">γίγνεσθαι</foreign>, equivalent to <foreign lang="greek">τὸ προσπταίειν</foreign>. The metaphor is from driving: a sudden and unexpected check, or pulling against him, will often cause a horse to stumble, or bring him on his knees. The abrupt cessation of the onward motion, in the listener's mind, as in the horse's career, produces analogous effects&mdash;whence the metaphor&mdash;in the two cases. </p>
						<p>&lsquo;Those again which are too long produce a feeling of being left behind, like those who (in a measured walk, as in the colonnade of a gymnasium) turn back only after passing (not till they have passed) the limit; for they too&mdash;like the speaker that uses too long periods&mdash;leave behind their companions in the walk&rsquo;. </p>
						<p>The notion is that of a party walking backwards and forwards in the portico of a gymnasium, the walk, like the period, being properly limited, though the limit is capable of being passed. If one of the party &mdash;suppose Aristotle himself in his daily <foreign lang="greek">περίπατοι</foreign> in the Lyceum&mdash; chanced to have thus outstripped his companions, the latter would be left in the lurch, and be no longer able to hear him. Similarly the speaker who makes his periods of undue length, leaves <hi rend="italic">his</hi> hearers in the lurch: they stop short, as it were, and lose the thread of his discourse. <foreign lang="greek">ἀποκάμπτειν</foreign> is here not in its usual sense, but &lsquo;to turn <hi rend="italic">away</hi>&rsquo; in the sense of &lsquo;turning back&rsquo;, as <foreign lang="greek">ἀποδιδόναι, ἀπονέμειν, ἀπαιτεῖν</foreign>. </p>
						<p>On this subject comp. Cic. Orat. LIII 178, <hi rend="italic">itaque et longiora et breviora iudicat et perfecta ac moderata semper expectat; mutila sentit quaedam et quasi decurtata, quibus tanquam debito fraudetur offenditur, productiora alia et quasi immoderatius excurrentia, quae magis etiam aspernantur aures</hi>, et seq. <pb n="100"/> </p>
						<p>&lsquo;And in like manner also the periods that are too long become so many speeches, and like a dithyrambic prelude; that is, rambling and incoherent, without unity or system. </p>
						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">αἱ περίοδοι...λόγος γίνεται</lemma>] verb attracted from the plural to the singular, as the nearer of the two: so <hi rend="italic">infra</hi>, <foreign lang="greek">αἵ τε λίαν βραχύκωλοι οὐ περίοδος γίγνεται</foreign>.

						<p>&lsquo;And therefore what Democritus of Chios quoted to taunt Melanippides for writing (long, rambling) dithyrambic preludes instead of the (compact and regular) stanzas, is realized (in these overgrown periods). &ldquo;A man works mischief to himself in working mischief to another, and the long dithyrambic prelude is most mischievous to its composer&rdquo; (substituted for <foreign lang="greek">ἡ δὲ κακὴ βουλὴ τῷ βουλεύσαντι κακίστη</foreign>, of the original, Hesiod. Op. et D. 263): for a taunt of the same kind may also be appropriately applied to the long-membered gentry, (the dealers in long-membered periods)&rsquo;. <hi rend="italic">The makers of the periods</hi> are themselves called here <foreign lang="greek">μακρόκωλοι</foreign>. To scan the second verse of the quotation <foreign lang="greek">μακρα_ναβολή</foreign> must be read as a crasis. &ldquo;Democritus Chius Musicus, Abderitae aequalis teste Diogene Laertio, IX 49 (<foreign lang="greek">γεγόνασι δὲ Δημόκριτοι ἕξ· πρῶτος αὐτὸς οὗτος, δεύτερος Χῖος μουσικὸς κατὰ τὸν αὐτὸν χρόνον</foreign>).

						<p>In the note on <foreign lang="greek">ἀναβολαί</foreign>, Introd. p. 307, already referred to, may be found some account of the two kinds of dithyramb here alluded to; the earlier antistrophic form of that of Arion, Stesichorus, Pindar, and the novel, relaxed, often incoherent, extravagances, of Melanippides and his followers. Nevertheless, Melanippides is selected by Aristodemus, in answer to Socrates' question, Xen. Mem. I 4. 3, as the most distinguished representative of dithyrambic poetry, as Homer of epic, Sophocles of tragedy, Polycletus of sculpture, and Zeuxis of painting. This represents the popular judgment, as opposed to that of the critics. On this subject, I have referred to Bode, <hi rend="italic">Gesch. der Hell. Dichtk.</hi> Vol. II Pt. II p. 111 seq. and 293 seq. and to M&uuml;ller, <hi rend="italic">Hist. Gr. Lit.</hi> c. XXX. See also Arist. Probl. XIX 15. Of melanippides of Melos, there is a life in Smith's <hi rend="italic">Biogr. Dict.</hi> [E. Curtius, <hi rend="italic">Greek Hist.</hi> Vol. IV p. 102 of Ward's tr.] </p>
						<p>&lsquo;Those which have their members too short make no period at all: and so it (i.e. the period made up of these short <foreign lang="greek">κῶλα</foreign>) drags the hearer with it headlong&rsquo;. The audience is <hi rend="italic">carried away</hi> by them, as by a <pb n="101"/> horse, at a headlong, break-neck, pace. Specimens of this style are given in Introd. p. 314, note 1. </p>
					</div3>
					<div3 id="b3c9s7" type="section" n="7">
						<p>&lsquo;The periodic style has two divisions, of which the one has its clauses (simply) divided, the other opposed to one another; an instance of simple division is, &ldquo;I have often wondered that those who first assembled these universal gatherings and established the athletic contests...&rdquo;&rsquo; <foreign lang="greek">διῃρημένη λέξις</foreign>, &ldquo;in qua membra periodi copula a se invicem distinguuntur.&rdquo; Ernesti, <hi rend="italic">Lex. Techn. Gr.</hi> <foreign lang="greek">διαιρεῖν</foreign>. This is the opening of Isocrates' Panegyric Speech, supposed or intended to be delivered at the &lsquo;General Assembly&rsquo; of the great Olympic games&mdash;whence the name. It is remarkable, and shews that Ar. could not have looked at the passage he was quoting, that the very next words to those at which his quotation stops, long before the end of the sentence, contain a regular antithesis or opposition of members, and the &lsquo;simple division&rsquo; is absolutely confined to the words cited. I should suppose that he could not have been aware of this. </p>
						<p>&lsquo;(An instance) of the antithetic period, wherein in each of the two clauses contrary by contrary are brought together, or (the same word is imposed as a yoke, i.e. bracket, or <hi rend="italic">vinculum</hi>, on both contraries) the two contraries are coupled together by one and the same word, is &ldquo;Both they served, them that remained, and them that followed; for the one they acquired more land than they had at home in addition, and to the others they left behind sufficient in what they had at home.&rdquo; <foreign lang="greek">ὑπομονή</foreign>, (staying behind) is contrary to <foreign lang="greek">ἀκολούθησις</foreign> (following), <foreign lang="greek">ἱκανόν</foreign> to <foreign lang="greek">πλεῖον</foreign>&rsquo;. </p>
						<p>It is unnecessary to say that the passage is quoted wrong: it runs in the original, Paneg. &sect; 35, 6, <foreign lang="greek">ἀμφ. δὲ καὶ τοὺς ἀκολ. καὶ τοὺς ὑπομ. ἔσωσαν· τοῖς μὲν γὰρ ἱκανὴν τὴν οἴκοι χώραν κατέλιπον, τοῖς δὲ πλείω τῆς ὑπαρχούσης ἐπόρισαν</foreign>. The first clause is an exemplification of <foreign lang="greek">ἐπίζευξις</foreign>, on which see note <hi rend="italic">supra</hi> c. 5 &sect; 7; the second, of the antithesis of contraries in two clauses balanced and opposed to one another. </p>
						<p>In the quotation that follows, Paneg. &sect; 41, the original is, <foreign lang="greek">ὥστε καὶ τοῖς</foreign> <pb n="102"/> <foreign lang="greek">χρημάτων δεομένοις καὶ τοῖς ἀπολαῦσαι τῶν ὑπαρχόντων ἐπιθυμοῦσιν ἀμφοτέροις ἁρμόττειν</foreign>. Ar. in his alteration has adorned Isocrates' text with an additional rhetorical figure, the <foreign lang="greek">ὁμοιοτέλευτον</foreign> or rhyming terminations of <foreign lang="greek">δεομένοις</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">βουλομένοις. ἀπόλαυσις</foreign>, (sensual) enjoyment, is opposed to <foreign lang="greek">κτήσει</foreign>, acquisition&rsquo;, as the text has it. As these two can hardly be considered antithetical, and nothing corresponding to <foreign lang="greek">κτήσει</foreign> occurs in Isocr., are we to suppose that Ar., meaning to write <foreign lang="greek">ἐνδείᾳ</foreign>, carelessly substituted <foreign lang="greek">κτήσει</foreign>? or rather, that <foreign lang="greek">κτήσει</foreign> is a mistake of a copyist for <foreign lang="greek">δεήσει</foreign>, which occurs twice in the sense of &lsquo;want&rsquo; II 7. 3 and 4: and also, in the same sense, Pseudo-Plato, Eryxias, 405 E <hi rend="italic">bis.</hi> </p>
						<p>Then follows a string of quotations from the same speech of Isocrates, illustrative of antithesis; &sect; 48 (wrong), &sect; 72 (right), &sect; 89 (right again), &sect; 105 (wrong), &sect; 149 (right), &sect; 181 (wrong), &sect; 186 (wrong, <foreign lang="greek">ἄξειν</foreign> for <foreign lang="greek">ἕξειν</foreign>). </p>
						<p>The passage <foreign lang="greek">τὸν μὲν Ἑλλήσποντον κ.τ.λ.</foreign> occurs likewise in the funeral oration attributed to Lysias, &sect; 29. This speech is marked as spurious by Baiter and Sauppe in their ed. of the <hi rend="italic">Or. Att.</hi> If this be so, the figure is probably due to Isocrates, which is all the more likely as Lysias' style, <foreign lang="greek">λιτὴ καὶ ἀφελής</foreign>, is usually free from these rhetorical artifices. Victorius refers to an imitation of this, Cic. de Fin. II 34. 112, <hi rend="italic">Ut si Xerxes... Hellesponto iuncto, Athone perfosso, maria ambulavisset terramque navigasset.</hi> And Lucr. III 1042 (1029, Munro), <hi rend="italic">ille quoque ipse</hi> (Xerxes) <hi rend="italic">viam qui quondam per mare magnum stravit</hi>, et seq. </p>
						<p>&lsquo;And what some one (some advocate, in accusation, whose name Ar. either had never heard, or didn't recollect) said against Peitholaus and Lycophron in the law-court (at <hi rend="italic">some</hi> trial: <hi rend="italic">quaere</hi>, theirs?), &ldquo;And these fellows (<foreign lang="greek">οὗτοι</foreign>, apparently &lsquo;the accused&rsquo; or &lsquo;opponents&rsquo; as usual) who used to sell you when they were at home, now that they have come to you here, have bought you&rdquo;&rsquo;. Peitholaus and Lycophron were brothers of Thebe, the wife of Alexander of Pherae. At her instigation they murdered their brother-in-law and succeeded him in the dynasty. They maintained themselves long against the attacks of Philip by the aid of Onomarchus the Phocian commander, but at last were defeated, 353&mdash;352 B. C., and Onomarchus slain; upon which they &ldquo;retired with their mercenaries, 2000 in number, into Phokis.&rdquo; Grote, <hi rend="italic">Hist. Gr.</hi> from Diodorus, Vol. XI ch. LXXXVII pp. 366, 408, 9, 11, where Lycophron alone is mentioned as &lsquo;the despot of Pherae&rsquo;: in p. 412, <pb n="103"/> Peitholaus and Lycophron are named together for the first time as joint commanders. </p>
						<p>As the time, place, and circumstances, as well as the speaker, of what is here related, are alike utterly unknown, any attempt at interpreting it must be a mere guess. <hi rend="italic">My</hi> conjecture is, (1) that the scene is a court of justice&mdash;<hi rend="italic">where</hi>, no one can say; I will assume at Athens&mdash; (2) that <foreign lang="greek">οὗτοι</foreign> are Peitholaus and Lycophron, as accused or defendants&mdash; this is suggested by <foreign lang="greek">εἰς Π. τις εἶπε</foreign> and the use of <foreign lang="greek">οὗτοι</foreign>&mdash;and if so, this must have been <hi rend="italic">after</hi> their downfall: and (3) that, to give the remark a point, <foreign lang="greek">ἐώνηνται</foreign> must have a double sense. &lsquo;These fellows, says <hi rend="italic">some one</hi> to the judges, used when they were at home, at Pherae, to <hi rend="italic">sell you</hi> (as slaves)&mdash;<foreign lang="greek">ὑμᾶς</foreign> maliciously identifies the Athenian judges with their fellow-countrymen, captives in Thessaly&mdash;<hi rend="italic">now</hi> that they are come to you, the tables are turned, and they have to <hi rend="italic">buy</hi> you&rsquo; (i. e. to bribe the judges). Victorius, but utterly without point, <hi rend="italic">Videtur contumeliosa vox in eos iacta, qui pecunia, quam comparassent in suis civibus hostibus emancipandis, eadem postea uterentur in illis ab iisdem emendis, atque in servitudinem sibi adiudicandis.</hi> </p>
						<p>&lsquo;For all these (passages) do what has been mentioned&rsquo;, i. e. give an antithetical structure to the several sentences. </p>

						<p>&lsquo;This kind of style is agreeable because contraries are best known (in themselves and by reason of their opposition), and still better when placed side by side (in juxtaposition, for the purpose of contrast and comparison); and also because it resembles a syllogism; for the <foreign lang="greek">ἔλεγχος</foreign> (the refutative syllogism) is a bringing together (for the same purpose) of the two opposites (the two contradictory conclusion)&rsquo;. </p>
						<p>This opposition of contraries in the antithesis, also reminds us of the <foreign lang="greek">ἔλεγχος</foreign>, the conclusion of opposites, refutation by an opposite conclusion; this resemblance makes the former look like a proof, which is a source of pleasure. </p>
						<p>Aristotle is constantly telling us&mdash;see Bonitz ad Metaph. B 2, 996 <hi rend="italic">a</hi> 18 &mdash;that contraries, which are the two extremes of things under the same genus, are also subject to the same science, <foreign lang="greek">τῶν ἐναντία μία</foreign>, or <foreign lang="greek">ἡ αὐτή, ἐπιστήμη</foreign>. And accordingly, inferences may be drawn from one contrary to another, Eth. N. V 1, 1129 <hi rend="italic">a</hi> 14 seq. This appears to be the foundation of what is here said, that contraries are best known to us; they can be studied together, and one throws light upon the other. Comp. III 11. 9, <pb n="104"/> <foreign lang="greek">ὅσῳ ἂν...ἀντικειμένως λεχθῇ τοσούτῳ εὐδοκιμεῖ μᾶλλον. τὸ δ’  αἴτιον ὅτι ἡ μάθησις διὰ μὲν τὸ ἀντικεῖσθαι μᾶλλον...γίνεται</foreign>. II 23. 30 and III 17. 13, on <foreign lang="greek">ἔλεγχος</foreign>, and the <hi rend="italic">conclusion</hi> (implying learning) <hi rend="italic">from opposites.</hi> In Probl. XIX 5, <foreign lang="greek">ἡδὺ τὸ μανθάνειν</foreign> is assigned, as an acknowledged truth, in explanation of a musical fact. &lsquo;Best known&rsquo; seems to mean that contraries, being under the same genus, are better known than any other things that have no such relation, or no relation at all, to one another. </p>
						<p>On the pleasure derived from learning, which is here assumed to be the explanation of the agreeableness of this periodic style, see the notes on I 11. 21, 23; particularly the latter, in which it is fully illustrated from Aristotle's writings. I will repeat here that the Metaphysics opens with a statement that all men have a natural longing for (strive after) knowledge, <foreign lang="greek">πάντες ἄνθρωποι τοῦ εἰδέναι ὀρέγονται φύσει</foreign>: and this of course implies pleasure in learning, which is the satisfaction of this natural appetite. The natural love of imitation or copying, which gives rise to all the imitative arts, is based in the same way upon the desire and pleasure of learning. And contrariwise therefore (this is additional), as we saw in c. 8. 2, <foreign lang="greek">ἀηδὲς καὶ ἄγνωστον τὸ ἄπειρον</foreign>, the infinite, or indefinite, is displeasing to us because it is unknowable. Comp. <hi rend="italic">infra</hi> c. 10. 2, <foreign lang="greek">τὸ γὰρ μανθάνειν ῥᾳδίως ἡδὺ φύσει πᾶσίν ἐστι</foreign>: the <hi rend="italic">words</hi> that convey the most instruction to us are the most pleasing; hence the pleasure derived from <hi rend="italic">metaphors</hi>, which is explained: <foreign lang="greek">γλῶτται</foreign> on the contrary, which teach us nothing, are therefore disagreeable. </p>

						<p>&lsquo;Such then is antithesis; the equality of the members (or clauses) is <foreign lang="greek">παρίσωσις; παρομοίωσις</foreign> is when each of the two members (the supposition that the period consists of only <hi rend="italic">two</hi> clauses is still carried on) has its extremities similar (i. e. in the letters, so that the terminations <hi rend="italic">rhyme</hi> to one another). (The clauses) must have this either at the beginning or at the end. And when they (the similar sounding letters) are at the beginning (the figure is) always (expressed in) whole words (<hi rend="italic">lit.</hi> the words, entire words, always are a beginning), but at the end (it admits of) either the (similarity of the) last syllables, or the same word with a changed termination (declension, adverbial, adjectival, termination, &amp;c), or the same word. Similar sound (<foreign lang="greek">παρομοίωσις</foreign>) at the com<pb n="105"/> mencement (may be illustrated by) such examples as this; <foreign lang="greek">ἀγρὸν γὰρ ἔλαβεν ἀργὸν</foreign> (fallow, uncultivated) <foreign lang="greek">παρ’  αὐτοῦ</foreign>&rsquo;. Victorius quotes a parallel example from Xen. Cyrop. VIII 3. 15, <foreign lang="greek">οὐ δυνάμενος τρέφειν ἀργὸν εἰς ἀγρὸν ἀπαγαγὼν ἐκέλευσεν ἐργάζεσθαι</foreign>. The &lsquo;rhyme at the beginning&rsquo; of clauses is properly called <foreign lang="greek">ὁμοιοκάταρκτον</foreign>; at the end <foreign lang="greek">ὁμοιοτέλευτον</foreign> and, <foreign lang="greek">δωρητοί τ̓ ἐπέλοντο παράρρητοί τ̓ ἐπέεσσιν</foreign>. Il.

						<p>&lsquo;And an inflexion (declension, change of termination from a root: see note on I 7. 27) of the same word (i. e. root) <foreign lang="greek">ἄξιος δὲ σταθῆναι χαλκοῦς, οὐκ ἄξιος ὢν χαλκοῦ</foreign>, &ldquo;worthy to be set up in brass (have a bronze statue erected in his honour, Dem. de F.

Ib. &sect; 378, <foreign lang="greek">ἔστιν ὅντιν’  ὑμεῖς...χαλκοῦν στήσαιτ̓ ἂν ἐν ἀγορᾷ</foreign>; as a public benefactor), not being worth a brass farthing&rdquo;&rsquo;. (Supposed to deserve a brass statue&mdash;<hi rend="italic">bronze</hi> in reality&mdash;when he doesn't deserve a brass farthing.

Ar. however seems to class both under his <foreign lang="greek">παρομοίωσις</foreign>). </p>
						<p>&lsquo;And the same word (repeated) <foreign lang="greek">ἔλεγες κακῶς...γράφεις κακῶς</foreign>&rsquo;. Demetrius, who repeats all this, following Arist. very closely, and sometimes borrowing his examples, supplies in his version a word which is wanting in our text, both to the sense and to the due balance of the sentence: <foreign lang="greek">σὺ δ’  αὐτὸν καὶ ζῶντα ἔλεγες κακῶς, καὶ νῦν θανόντα γράφεις κακῶς</foreign>. Demetr. <foreign lang="greek">περὶ ἑρμηνείας</foreign> &sect; 26.

This sentence was applied by some rival orator to one who, after slandering some one all his life, after his death wrote a panegyric on him&mdash;which, the speaker says, was just as bad as his slander<note anchored="yes">This reminds us of Lord Lyndhurst's saying of Campbell's <hi rend="italic">Lives of the Chancellors:</hi> that the prospect of having his life written by him added a new terror to death.</note>. <pb n="106"/> </p>
						<p>&lsquo;And (a rhyming termination arising) from a single syllable: <foreign lang="greek">δειν-όν... ἀργ-όν</foreign>. And the same clause may have all three at once, and the antithesis and balance of clauses, and similar termination may be the same&rsquo; (included or exemplified in one or the same clause). An instance of this is given by Victorius from a saying of Gorgias preserved by Plutarch, Cimon. c. 10, <foreign lang="greek">τὸν Κίμωνα τὰ χρήματα κτᾶσθαι μὲν ὡς χρῷτο, χρῆσθαι δὲ ὡς τιμῷτο</foreign>. Gorg. Fragm. Sauppe, <hi rend="italic">Or. Att.</hi> III p. 131, Fr. Inc. 6. This is not only antithesis and the rest, but a false antithesis to boot. Demetr., u. s. &sect; 23, has supplied a much more elaborate example from Isocr. Helen. &sect; 17. <foreign lang="greek">τῷ</foreign> (<foreign lang="greek">τοῦ</foreign> Isocr.) <foreign lang="greek">μὲν ἐπίπονον καὶ φιλοκίνδυνον τὸν βίον κατέστησε</foreign> (Dem. has <foreign lang="greek">ἐποίησε</foreign>), <foreign lang="greek">τῆς δὲ περίβλεπτον καὶ περιμάχητον τὴν φύσιν ἐποίησεν</foreign> (Dem. <foreign lang="greek">κατέστησεν</foreign>). &lsquo;The <hi rend="italic">commencements</hi> of periods (in this view of the artificial structure of the sentence) have been enumerated with tolerable (<foreign lang="greek">σχεδόν</foreign> &lsquo;pretty nearly&rsquo;) completeness (<foreign lang="greek">ἐξ</foreign>&mdash;&lsquo;out&rsquo;, &lsquo;to the end or full&rsquo;) in the Theodectea. There are also false antitheses, as Epicharmus, besides others, (<foreign lang="greek">καί</foreign>) wrote, <foreign lang="greek">τόκα μὲν κ.τ.λ.</foreign>&rsquo; This line of Epicharmus is also given by Demetr. u. s. &sect; 24. He speaks of it as &lsquo;said in jest&rsquo;, <foreign lang="greek">πεπαιγμένοντὸ αὐτὸ μὲν γὰρ εἴρηται, καὶ οὐδὲν ἐναντίον</foreign>&mdash;to make fun of the rhetoricians, <foreign lang="greek">σκώπτων τοὺς ῥήτορας</foreign>, viz. Gorgias and his school, the inventors of antithesis and the rest of these rhetorical novelties. </p>
						<p>For further details on the subject of these rhetorical figures introduced by Gorgias and his school, who carried them to a vicious excess, a style to which the term <foreign lang="greek">Γοργιάζειν</foreign> was afterwards applied; which was thought to have attained its highest perfection in the measured and laboured, empty and monotonous, periods of Isocrates;&mdash;see the paper on Gorgias, <hi rend="italic">Camb. Journ. of Cl. and Sacred Phil.</hi>, No. VII, Vol. III. p. 69 seq. where they are classified and arranged under three heads, representing parallelism in <hi rend="italic">sense, structure</hi>, and <hi rend="italic">sound</hi>, which is in fact Aristotle's division. Illustrative extracts from Gorgias' speeches are given at p. 67: and a collection of his fragments in Sauppe, Fragm. Or. Att. (appended to the <hi rend="italic">Or. Att.</hi> Vol. III) p. 129 seq. [Compare Blass, <hi rend="italic">die Attische Beredsamkeit</hi>, I pp. 60&mdash;62, and Thompson's ed. of the Gorgias, Appendix, <hi rend="italic">On the Fragments of Gorgias.</hi>] </p>
						<p>Perhaps the most complete specimen of Isocrates' style in his Panegyric, from which I will select one or two illustrations, is &sect; 76, <foreign lang="greek">οὐ γὰρ ὠλιγώρουν τῶν κοινῶν, οὐδ’  ἀπέλαυον μὲν ὡς ἰδίων, ἠμέλουν δὲ ὡς ἀλλοτρίων, ἀλλ̓ ἐκήδοντο μὲν ὡς οἰκείων, ἀπείχοντο δ̓ ὥσπερ χρὴ τῶν μηδὲν προσηκόντων·</foreign> and so on, in the same measured strain. Of <foreign lang="greek">παρομοίωσις</foreign>, we have an example &sect; 45, <foreign lang="greek">ἔτι δ’  ἀγῶνας ἰδεῖν μὴ μόνον τάχους καὶ ῥώμης, ἀλλὰ καὶ λόγων καὶ γνώμης, κ.τ.λ.</foreign> The rhyming terminations pervade &sect;&sect; 185, 186, culminating in a sentence, in which for once the echo is really effective, <foreign lang="greek">φήμην δὲ καὶ μνήμην καὶ δόξαν πόσην τίνα χρὴ νομίζειν ἢ ζῶντας ἕξειν ἢ τελευτήσαντας καταλείψειν τοὺς ἐν τοῖς τοιούτοις ἔργοις ἀριστεύσαντας;</foreign> (Aesch. c. Ctes. p. 65 &sect; 78, at the close of a paragraph, <foreign lang="greek">οὐ γὰρ τὸν τρόπον ἀλλὰ τὸν τόπον μόνον μετήλλαξεν</foreign>. Ennius, ap. Cic. Orat. XXVII 23, <hi rend="italic">Arce et urbe orba sum.</hi>) No better illustration could be found of the importance of <pb n="107"/> the precept so much insisted upon by Aristotle, that the art employed in composition should be carefully concealed, than the striking difference in point of interest between the studied, monotonous, wearisome periods of Isocrates, and the animated, vigorous, natural, yet rhythmical periods of Demosthenes, on which though at least as much pains and labour had been bestowed by the one as by the other&mdash;the critics said &lsquo;they smelt of the lamp&rsquo;&mdash;in the one the study entirely escapes notice, in the other it is most painfully apparent. </p>
						<p>On antithesis and the rest, there are also remarks in Introd. pp. 314, 5, and the note: and on the divisions of the period, <foreign lang="greek">κόμμα</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">κῶλον</foreign>, of which the last two are <hi rend="italic">not</hi> distinguished by Ar., p. 312, note 1. </p>
						<p>The meaning and authorship of the Theodectea has been already discussed at length, p. 55, seq. The conclusion arrived at is, that the work here referred to was an earlier treatise on Rhetoric by Aristotle, the result of his rhetorical <hi rend="italic">teaching</hi>, which confined itself to the subjects dealt with in the extant third book. <foreign lang="greek">αἱ ἀρχαὶ τῶν περιόδων</foreign>, which is confined by the <hi rend="italic">expression</hi> to the <foreign lang="greek">ὁμοιοκάταρκτον</foreign>, may perhaps, as Victorius supposed, be intended to include by inference all the other figures described in this chapter. </p>

					<p>This chapter offers a remarkable exception, at all events in the first six sections, to Aristotle's ordinary manner of writing; in that the thoughts are in some degree written out and the meaning fairly represented by the language: instead of being left, as usual, to the sagacity of the reader to fill up and interpret as best he can. </p>

						<p>&lsquo;Having discussed and settled the preceding subject we have next to describe the sources of lively, pointed, sprightly, witty, facetious, clever, and popular (<foreign lang="greek">εὐδοκιμοῦντα</foreign>) sayings. Now to make them is the result either of natural ability (cleverness) or of long practice (exercise); the exhibition (or explanation) of them is the province of this study (or treatise)&rsquo;. <foreign lang="greek">εὐφυής</foreign>, note on I 6.15. The Rhet. ad Alex. c. 22 (23) treats of <foreign lang="greek">ἀστεῖον</foreign> in style, apparently with much the same meaning as that of Aristotle. See the analysis of the chap. in Introd. p. 434. Brevity is at all events an element of <foreign lang="greek">τὸ ἀστεῖον</foreign>. Aristotle's <foreign lang="greek">τὸ ἀστεῖον</foreign> seems to correspond to Campbell's &lsquo;vivacity&rsquo; of style, which is treated in the first three chapters of his third book. <pb n="108"/> </p>

						<p>&lsquo;Let us then describe it by a complete (thorough or detailed) enumeration, and let this be our starting-point. Learning namely with ease (without trouble or labour) is naturally agreeable to every one, and names (nouns) are significant; and therefore all nouns or words from which we learn anything are most agreeable&rsquo;. On this see note on c. 9 &sect; 8, add c. 11. 9, and I 11. 21, 23. </p>
						<p>&lsquo;Now words strange, foreign, archaic, are not known at all (and can therefore convey no information), and the proper, ordinary, names of things, we know already. It is the metaphor (the only remaining kind of single word) that does this in the highest degree: for when (the poet, Homer Od. <foreign lang="greek">ξ</foreign> [XIV] 214) calls old age a (dry, withered) stalk or stubble, he conveys learning and knowledge through the medium of the <hi rend="italic">genus</hi>, because both are withered&rsquo;, &lsquo;are fallen into the <hi rend="italic">sere and yellow leaf</hi>&rsquo;. <foreign lang="greek">διὰ τοῦ γένους</foreign>, because the metaphor brings remote members (<hi rend="italic">species</hi>) of the same <hi rend="italic">genus</hi> into a novel comparison, which teaches us something new of one or the other. </p>

						<p>&lsquo;Now the poets' similes produce the same effect (give point, vivacity, or liveliness, to the narrative of an epic poem, in which they usually appear): and therefore if the simile be well (selected or executed, or both), it gives an air of liveliness, point, vividness to the composition. For the simile, as has been said before&rsquo; (not literally what is said here, but the substance of it, III 4. 1), &lsquo;is a metaphor, differing from it merely by the manner of setting forth (mode of statement): and therefore it is less agreeable because longer (<foreign lang="greek">μακροτέρως, λεγομένη</foreign> or <foreign lang="greek">πεποιημένη</foreign>, <hi rend="italic">lit.</hi> written in a longer form, at greater length), and (because) it does not say directly that (of the two things compared) one <hi rend="italic">is</hi> the other; and accordingly (as the speaker's <hi rend="italic">tongue</hi> does not say this, so) neither does the (hearer's) mind look out for it&rsquo;&mdash;and so loses the opportunity of <hi rend="italic">learning.</hi> </p>
						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">μακροτέρως</lemma>] On this termination of the adv. comparative, see Jelf, <hi rend="italic">Gr. Gr.</hi> &sect; 141. 3, Donaldson's <hi rend="italic">Gr. Gr.</hi> &sect; 282 b, [K&uuml;hner, <hi rend="italic">Gr. Gr.</hi> &sect; 158, 2]. Matthiae has omitted it. </p>
						<p>The meaning of <foreign lang="greek">προθέσει</foreign>, by which the simile is said here to differ from <pb n="109"/> the metaphor, may be inferred from the previous passage referred to, III 4. 1, but is not there directly expressed. It means the &lsquo;mode of setting forth&rsquo;, of describing or stating the comparison which both of them make; just as in c. 13. 2, 3 (in Ar.'s division of the speech), and Rhet. ad Alex. 29 (30) &sect;&sect; 2, 21; 35 (36) &sect; 1, <foreign lang="greek">πρόθεσις</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">προεκτίθεναι</foreign> are put for &lsquo;the statement of the case&rsquo; or exposition of the facts. There are two distinguishable points in which the simile differs from the metaphor; the length, and (consequent) dilution of the force of its impression. The metaphor is concise, generally expressed in a single word, which <hi rend="italic">suggests</hi> the comparison, and <hi rend="italic">identifies</hi> the two things compared, <foreign lang="greek">λέγει ὡς τοῦτο ἐκεῖνο</foreign>; so that the comparison is forced directly upon the hearer's mind, who thereby learns something: whereas the simile goes into detail, often to a considerable length, so that it loses the pointed brevity of the metaphor; and instead of identifying the two objects compared, like the other, by the introduction of the <hi rend="italic">particle of comparison</hi> <foreign lang="greek">ὡς</foreign>, so weakens its force that the hearer is apt to lose the lesson and the pleasure that should be derived from it. </p>

For in the one case knowledge as it were is acquired; in the other, neither the one nor the other&rsquo;, i. e. in either of these two ways there is a sort of learning, either immediate or nearly so: in the other case, that of superficial and unintelligible enthymemes or style in general, neither immediate nor quasi-immediate knowledge is attainable.

						<p>The meaning of <foreign lang="greek">ἐνέργεια</foreign> is clearly shewn by a comparison with the statements of c. 11.

N. X 4, 1175 <hi rend="italic">a</hi> 12). This sense is borrowed from the metaphysical use of the term, to express &lsquo;realization&rsquo;, as opposed to <foreign lang="greek">δύναμις</foreign>, the mere capacity or potentiality of life and action. I may add that <foreign lang="greek">ἐνέργεια</foreign> is used in two distinct senses, representing two different forms of development, which may be distinguished as the metaphysical and moral applications of it; as will appear from a comparison of the form it assumes in the Nicom. Ethics, and the biology of the de Anima. It is sometimes identifiable with <foreign lang="greek">ἐντελέχεια</foreign>, expressing the actuality or actual realization of <hi rend="italic">existence</hi> out of a mere undeveloped capacity of life: in the moral view, it is the realization of <hi rend="italic">action</hi>, a realized activity, from the dormant capacity&mdash;implying existence&mdash;to the active exercise or energy of the bodily and mental functions.

						<p>&lsquo;Of the four kinds of metaphors, the proportional are the most popular&rsquo;. On metaphor in general, and the proportional metaphor in particular, see Appendix B to Bk. III, Introd. p. 374. </p>
						<p>Here follows a string of pointed, striking, sayings, exemplifying <pb n="112"/> <foreign lang="greek">τὸ ἀστεῖον</foreign> in style; all of them metaphors, and most of these conveyed in single words. They do really, I think, deserve the character attributed to them. The passage, <foreign lang="greek">τῶν δὲ μεταφορῶνπειρᾶσθαι δοῦναι</foreign>, is transcribed by Dionysius, Ep. I ad Amm. c. 8, in his enquiry into the date of the Rhetoric. The most important variation from the text of Ar. is the omission of the example from Leptines &ldquo;by all the MSS&rdquo; (Spengel's <hi rend="italic">Tract on Rhet.</hi> Munich 1851 p. 47), though it has been supplied in the printed copies; he begins the quotation with <foreign lang="greek">κατὰ λέξιν οὕτω γράφων</foreign>. The only other difference of any importance is <foreign lang="greek">ἀγαγόντα</foreign> for <foreign lang="greek">ἔχοντα</foreign>, and <foreign lang="greek">διδόναι οὕτως</foreign> for <foreign lang="greek">δοῦναι</foreign>. </p>
						<p>&lsquo;As Pericles said, that the youth that had perished in the war had vanished out of the city, as though one were to take the spring out of the year&rsquo;. On this saying, and Pericles' claim to it, see note on I 7.34. </p>
						<p>&lsquo;And Leptines of the Lacedaemonians, (to the Athenian assembly,) that he would not let them look on whilst Greece became one-eyed (lost one of her eyes&mdash;the other being of course Athens; <hi rend="italic">Athens, the eye of Greece</hi>, Milton, <hi rend="italic">P. R.</hi> IV 240). Victorius has produced similar expressions from Cic. pro leg. Manil. c. 5 &sect; 11, de Nat. Deor. III 38, <hi rend="italic">Hi duos illos oculos orae maritimae effoderunt.</hi> &ldquo;Similiter Cimon Atheniensibus suasit, <foreign lang="greek">μήτε τὴν Ἑλλάδα χωλήν, μήτε τὴν πόλιν ἑτερόζυγα περιϊδεῖν γεγενημένην</foreign>, Plut. Cim. 489 C, <foreign lang="greek">ὡς ὁ εἰπών, μὴ ποιήσητε ἑτερόφθαλμον τὴν Ἑλλάδα</foreign> (Plut. Polit. Praecept. 803 A),&rdquo; Victorius. The Leptines here mentioned is no doubt the proposer of the law <foreign lang="greek">περὶ τῆς ἀτελείας</foreign> against which Demosthenes delivered the speech c. Leptin. in B.C. 355. He may possibly be the same as the Leptines mentioned by Demosth. c. Androt. &sect; 60, <foreign lang="greek">ὁ ἐκ Κοίλης</foreign>. Wolf, <hi rend="italic">Proleg. ad Dem. Leptin.</hi> p. 45, note 12 (Sch&auml;fer, <hi rend="italic">Appar. ad Dem.</hi> p. 8), supposes that the author of this saying and the opponent of Demosthenes are the same person. The occasion on which Leptines produced his metaphor was the embassy sent by the Lacedaemonians to Athens in their extremity, after the defeat of Leuctra (371 B. C.), during the invasion of their country by the Thebans, B.C. 369; see Xen. Hellen. VI 5. 34, 35, Isocr. Archia &sect; 64, seq. Grote, <hi rend="italic">Hist. Gr.</hi> Vol. X [ch. LXXVIII] p. 320 seq. Thirlw. <hi rend="italic">Hist. Gr.</hi> ch. XXXIX (Vol. v. p. 106, 1st ed.). Isocrates, Areop. &sect; 69, alludes to the same event, <foreign lang="greek">ὥστε Λακεδαιμονίους, τοὺς ἐπὶ τῆς ὀλιγαρχίας ὀλίγου δεῖν καθ’  ἑκάστην τὴν ἡμέραν προστάττοντας ἡμῖν</foreign> (see the fragm. of Lysias, Or. 34, quoted in note on II 23. 19, on this Lacedaemonian &lsquo;dictation&rsquo;, 404 B. C.) <foreign lang="greek">ἐλθεῖν ἐπὶ τῆς δημοκρατίας</foreign> (369 B. C.) <foreign lang="greek">ἱκετεύσοντας καὶ δεησομένους μὴ περιϊδεῖν αὑτοὺς ἀναστάτους γενομένους</foreign>. [A. Schaefer's <hi rend="italic">Dem. u. s. Zeit</hi>, I p. 75, note.] </p>
						<p>&lsquo;And the saying of Cephisodotus, in his indignation at Chares' eager<pb n="113"/> ness for the scrutiny of the accounts (of his charge) in the conduct of the Olynthian war, &ldquo;that he drove the people into a fit of choking by his (pertinacity in the) attempt to offer his accounts for scrutiny in this way.&rdquo;&rsquo; He wanted to force his accounts down their throats, and nearly choked them in the attempt. I have followed Dionysius' version of this extract, which is plainly preferable to the text of Aristotle. <foreign lang="greek">ἄγειν εἰς πνῖγμα</foreign> is Greek and sense; <foreign lang="greek">ἔχειν εἰς πνῖγμα</foreign> neither one nor the other; and <foreign lang="greek">διδόναι οὕτως</foreign>, at the end, has far more meaning than the simple <foreign lang="greek">δοῦναι</foreign> of our text. With the vulgar reading, <foreign lang="greek">ἔχοντα</foreign> must be taken with <foreign lang="greek">τὰς εὐθύνας</foreign>, &ldquo;with his accounts in his hands&rdquo;&mdash;which is so far graphic, as it indicates the eagerness with which he was trying to force them upon the people&mdash;but then <foreign lang="greek">δοῦναι τὸν δῆμον εἰς πνῖγμα</foreign>, for &lsquo;to drive them into a choking-fit&rsquo;, is surely indefensible. </p>
						<p>Cephisodotus, <foreign lang="greek">ὁ ἐκ Κεραμέων</foreign>, has been already quoted; see III 4.3 note (near the end of the section [p. 53]), where some account is given. Two more of his pungent sayings are quoted further on. Chares, with his mercenaries, was sent to take the command in the Olynthian war in 349 B. C. (Clinton, <hi rend="italic">F. H.</hi>). Olynthus was taken by Philip, 347. This notice is cited by Max Schmidt in his tract <hi rend="italic">On the date of Ar.'s Rhetoric</hi>, p. 15, as a piece of evidence on that question; but the limit of the period of publication can be brought much lower down. See Introd. <hi rend="italic">On the date of the Rhetoric</hi>, p. 36 seq. </p>
						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">πνῖγμα</lemma> or <foreign lang="greek">πνιγμός</foreign>, and its congeners, is a medical term, used by Hippocrates, expressive of choking, stifling, suffocation. </p>
						<p>&lsquo;And the same (Cephisodotus) once in an exhortation to the Athenians said that they must march out (at once) to Euboea (to the aid of the Euboeans), and <hi rend="italic">there</hi> provide themselves with provisions&rsquo; (read by all means <foreign lang="greek">ἐπισιτισομένους</foreign>, the future, with Spengel; Bekker retains the <hi rend="italic">vulgata lectio</hi> <foreign lang="greek">ἐπισιτισαμένους</foreign>, which spoils the point), &lsquo;like Miltiades' decree&rsquo; (with all the unhesitating haste prescribed by Miltiades' decree at the time of the first Median invasion). They were <hi rend="italic">therefore</hi> not to lose any time in making provision <hi rend="italic">at home</hi>, but to get to Euboea with all speed and <hi rend="italic">there</hi> provide themselves: the future is necessary: Victorius, though he reads the aorist, translates it as the future. This hurried expedition to Euboea occurred in 358 B. C., Clinton, <hi rend="italic">F. H.</hi>, sub anno, Dem. c. Androt. &sect; 14, <foreign lang="greek">ἴσθ’  ὅτι πρῴην Εὐβοεῦσιν ἡμερῶν τριῶν ἐβοηθήσατε κ.τ.λ.</foreign> and Aesch. c. Ctes. &sect; 85. It was made to assist the Euboeans against the Theban invaders; and in the archonship of Cephisodotus himself. </p>
						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">τὸ Μιλτιάδου ψήφισμα</lemma>] is explained by the Scholiast, quoted by Vater, <foreign lang="greek">τὸ μὴ βουλεύσασθαι· Μιλτιάδης μὴ βουλευσάμενος ἐξῆλθεν κατὰ τοῦ Ξέρξου</foreign>: and more at length by Ulpian in Shilleto's note to Dem. de F. L. &sect; 346, <foreign lang="greek">ἐπιόντων τῶν Μήδων, ἐξαρχῆς καὶ ὁ Μιλτιάδης δραμεῖν εὐθὺς ἐπὶ τὸν Μαραθῶνα ἐψηφίσατο καὶ μὴ ἀναμένειν ἕως συλλεγῶσιν οἱ συμμαχήσοντες</foreign>. As to the grammatical construction of the accusative, it seems to be a substitution <pb n="114"/> of <foreign lang="greek">τὸ Μιλτιάδου ψήφισμα</foreign> for the proper cognate accusative <foreign lang="greek">ἔξοδον</foreign>, to make an expedition, such as, on the principle of, Miltiades' decree, with all haste, and without deliberation. </p>
						<p>&lsquo;And Iphicrates, indignant at the truce that the Athenians had made with Epidaurus and the neighbouring coasts, said of them that &ldquo;they had stript themselves of their provisions (not &lsquo;for the <hi rend="italic">way</hi>&rsquo;, but) for the war&rdquo;&rsquo;. <foreign lang="greek">ἐφόδια</foreign> are <hi rend="italic">viatica</hi>, provisions for a journey; which in the absence of inns the traveller had to carry with him: here, provisions for the support and maintenance of war and its expeditions. Hdt. writes <foreign lang="greek">ἐπόδια</foreign>, Xen. <foreign lang="greek">ἐφόδιον</foreign> (sing.). Arist., Pol. II 5, 1263 <hi rend="italic">a</hi> 37, uses it of provisions for hunting expeditions in Lacedaemon. </p>
						<p>The small independent state of Epidaurus, bounded by the territories of Corinth, Argolis, Troezen, and the Saronic gulf, was at this time in alliance with Sparta, to which it supplied troops, in the great contest with the confederate Greeks, allied for the reduction of the Lacedaemonian power, terminating in the battle of Corinth, 394 B. C., see Grote, <hi rend="italic">Hist. Gr.</hi> Vol. IX [ch. LXXIV] p. 422, 425; and Xenophon's description of the battle, Helen. IV 2.9&mdash;23. It appears from this passage that the Athenians had made a truce with Epidaurus. Cephisodotus' indignation was aroused at the folly of making a truce with people who had a sea-board, which the Athenians with their naval superiority could have plundered with impunity, and so have supported the war. </p>
						<p>&lsquo;And Peitholaus (called) the Paralian (trireme) &ldquo;the people's cudgel&rdquo;, and Sestos &ldquo;the corn-stall of the Piraeus&rdquo;&rsquo;. Whether this Peitholaus is the same as the one already mentioned III 9. 7, as associated with Lycophron in the government of Pherae, we have no means of precisely determining. The probability is that he is. For even Aristotle's carelessness could hardly have carried him so far as to neglect to mention the distinction between two persons named so nearly together, if there were any. This being so, it appears again, as from the former passage, that he lived at Athens after his downfall. </p>
						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">τὴν πάραλον</lemma>] This vessel and its companion the <foreign lang="greek">Σαλαμινία</foreign> were two picked vessels, fast sailers, and with carefully chosen and highly paid crews, kept in reserve at the Piraeus for state purposes; such as sacred embassies, <foreign lang="greek">θεωρίαι</foreign>, to carry the admiral of the fleet in a naval expedition, for ordinary embassies, &lsquo;for the transport of money and persons&rsquo; (B&ouml;ckh, <hi rend="italic">Publ. Econ.</hi>, Bk. II. c. 16, Lewis' Transl. p. 240), and for the pursuit and conveyance to Athens of state offenders who had made their escape; as Alcibiades after the mutilation of the Hermae, Thuc. VI 53, 61 <hi rend="italic">bis</hi>, of the Salaminia. As illustrating the use of the Paralus as a <foreign lang="greek">ῥόπαλον</foreign>, Demosth. <foreign lang="greek">περὶ τῶν ἐν Χεῤῥονήσῳ</foreign>, &sect; 29 is still more in point; <foreign lang="greek">ἀλλ’  ἐπὶ μὲν τοὺς ἐχθρούς, οὓς οὐκ ἔστι λαβεῖν ὑπὸ τοῖς νόμοις, καὶ στρατιώτας τρέφειν καὶ τριήρεις ἐκπέμπειν καὶ χρήματα εἰσφέρειν δεῖ καὶ ἀναγκαῖόν ἐστιν, ἐπὶ δ̓ ἡμᾶς αὐτοὺς ψήφισμα, εἰσαγγελία, Πάραλος, ταῦτ̓ ἐστίν</foreign>, i. e. the special decree, <pb n="115"/> impeachment, and the Paralus, were the three principal <hi rend="italic">instruments of punishment</hi> of offenders amongst the Athenian citizens. The <foreign lang="greek">Πάραλος</foreign> therefore is here compared to a <foreign lang="greek">ῥόπαλον</foreign> or cudgel, because it is the instrument with which the state deals her heaviest blows, not only upon those that have escaped her justice, but upon all those who offend her. <foreign lang="greek">Πάραλος· μία τῶν παρ’  Ἀθηναίων πρὸς τὰς δημοσίας χρείας διαπεμπομένων τριήρων</foreign>, Harpocr. s. v. He adds that the crews of the two vessels received four obols a day, and stayed at home the greater part of the year. Photius has four articles on the word, one of them borrowed from Harpocr., almost in the same words. The first of the four identifies the Salaminian and Paralian. There is an article upon this in Smith's <hi rend="italic">Dict. of Ant.</hi> (s. v. <hi rend="italic">Salaminia</hi>). </p>
						<p>Sestos, on the Hellespont, seems from this passage to have been one of the emporia for the corn which was imported from the coasts of the Black Sea and the adjacent regions. It is mentioned with others by Isocr. <foreign lang="greek">ἀντίδ</foreign>. &sect; 107, as an important and well-situated town. Strabo, in writing of Troas, makes no mention of the corn-stores of Sestos. [B&uuml;chsensch&uuml;tz, <hi rend="italic">Besitz und Erwerb</hi>, pp. 421&mdash;430 (on the corn-trade between Greece and the Euxine). The present passage, which he does not quote, suggests a modification of his statement on p. 426 that Sestos and Abydos were less important emporia than Lampsacus.] </p>
						<p>This corn-store or warehouse is compared to the &lsquo;shopboard&rsquo; or &lsquo;stall&rsquo; <foreign lang="greek">τηλία</foreign>, the tray on which corn was exposed for sale in the shops. The word was used for a &lsquo;stand&rsquo; or &lsquo;stage&rsquo; of various kinds. A passage which illustrates the use of it referred to here (which does <hi rend="italic">not</hi> appear in the Lexicons) is Arist. Hist. An. VI 24. 3, where there is an account of a wonderful mule, that lived to the age of 80; after it had been released from labour by reason of its age, it used to walk by the side of the teams which were dragging the stone for the building of <hi rend="italic">the</hi> temple (doubtless the Parthenon), and not only urged them on to their work, but helped them itself to drag the load up the hill (how this was done by the animal is not explained); <foreign lang="greek">ὥστ’  ἐψηφίσαντο μὴ ἀπελαύνειν αὐτὸν τοὺς σιτοπώλους ἀπὸ τῶν τηλιῶν</foreign>. This clearly explains the particular sense of <foreign lang="greek">τηλία</foreign> in this passage. The <foreign lang="greek">τηλία</foreign> is the tray or stand at the corn-dealer's door, in which the corn is exposed for sale. In Aristoph. Plut. 1038, it means &lsquo;a sieve&rsquo;, <foreign lang="greek">κοσκίνου κύκλος</foreign> <hi rend="italic">sive</hi> <foreign lang="greek">περιφέρεια</foreign>, Schol. ad loc., Etym., Suidas and Hesychius. </p>
						<p>&lsquo;And Pericles bade (his countrymen) get Aegina out of the way (get rid of it, as a plague or obstacle to their enjoyment or happiness) &ldquo;the eyesore of the Piraeus&rdquo;&rsquo;. This saying is quoted by Plutarch, Pol. Praec. 803 A, amongst the <foreign lang="greek">πολιτικὰ παραγγέλματα</foreign>: and also <foreign lang="greek">μὴ ποιήσητε ἑτερόφθαλμον τὴν Ἑλλάδα</foreign>, without the author's name. It is attributed to Demades by Athen. III 99 D, <foreign lang="greek">Δημάδης ὁ ῥήτωρ ἔλεγε τὴν μὲν Αἴγιναν λήμην εἶναι τοῦ Πειραιῶς</foreign>. Comp. Plut. Apophth. Reg. et Duc. 186 C, and Wyttenbach note <foreign lang="greek">β́</foreign> ad loc. It suggested to Casaubon an emendation of an apparently unmeaning word in Strabo IX p. 395, of the islet of Psyttalea, <pb n="116"/> between Salamis and the mainland, <foreign lang="greek">νήσιον ἔρημον πετρῶδες</foreign> (<foreign lang="greek">δύσορμος</foreign> Aesch. Pers. 450) <foreign lang="greek">ὅ τινες εἶπον λιμένα</foreign> (<hi rend="italic">lege</hi> <foreign lang="greek">λήμην</foreign>) <foreign lang="greek">τοῦ Πειραιῶς</foreign>. </p>
						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">λήμη</lemma> and <foreign lang="greek">λημᾶν</foreign> seem (from the Lexx.) to be almost confined to Aristophanes amongst the earlier writers. Arist. Lysistr. 301, with a pun upon <foreign lang="greek">λήμνιον πῦρ</foreign> (on which see Schneidewin on Soph. Philoct. 799); Plut. 581, <foreign lang="greek">Κρονικαῖς λήμαις</foreign> (old-fashioned prejudices, dimnesses of sight) <foreign lang="greek">ὄντως λημῶντες τὰς φρένας ἄμφω</foreign>. Nub. 327, <foreign lang="greek">λημᾷν κολοκύνταις</foreign>. (They occur however as medical terms in Hippocrates.) They are not found, where they were to be most expected, in the Fragments of the other Comic writers. No instance of either is to be found in the very complete Index to Meineke, <hi rend="italic">Fr. Com. Gr.</hi> </p>
						<p>&lsquo;And Moerocles said that he was in no respect a greater knave than &mdash;one of the respectable (upper) classes that he named: for the other played the knave at the rate of 33 per cent., he (himself) only at ten&rsquo;. The degree of knavery is compared to the rate of interest of profit which is made upon each: &ldquo;a very respectable person indeed!&rdquo; says Moerocles &ldquo;and a very respectable interest he makes upon his respectability (or, rightly <hi rend="italic">interpreted</hi>, roguery): why! I only get a third of that for mine.&rdquo; Of Moerocles an account is given in Smith's <hi rend="italic">Biogr. Dict.</hi> s. v. <foreign lang="greek">Μοιροκλῆς, Σαλαμίνιος τῶν παρ’  Ἀθηναίοις οὐκ ἀφανῶς πολιτευσαμένων</foreign>. Harpocr. He was a contemporary of Demosthenes, who mentions him four times, see Sauppe's <hi rend="italic">Ind. Nom. ad Or. Att.</hi> III 99, and an anti-Macedonian orator. He seems from the allusion, de F. L. &sect; 293 (&sect; 335) to have been a greedy fellow, and inclined to exaction in money-matters. On the rates of interest at Athens, and the modes of computing it, see B&ouml;ckh, <hi rend="italic">Publ. Econ.</hi> Bk. I. c. 22, Lewis' Tr. p. 130. </p>
						<p>&lsquo;And Anaxandrides&rsquo; iambic verse about (not &lsquo;on behalf of&rsquo;, of which there is no evidence <hi rend="italic">in the text</hi>) the daughters' (so in the Scriptures, &lsquo;<hi rend="italic">daughters</hi> of Jerusalem&rsquo;, &amp;c) &lsquo;who were over long about marrying, &ldquo;I find (<foreign lang="greek">μοί</foreign>) the young ladies have passed the day for their marriage.&rdquo;&rsquo; [&ldquo;My daughters' marriage-bonds have passed their date.&rdquo;] </p>
						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ὑπερήμερος</lemma>, here metaphorically used by Anaxandrides, is properly a technical term of Attic law, signifying one who has failed to pay a fine, or to comply with any judgment or verdict imposed by the court on the day appointed: one who has passed the prescribed term or the day fixed. It takes the genit. here, as if it were <foreign lang="greek">ὑπὲρ τὴν ἡμέραν τῶν γάμων</foreign>, like <foreign lang="greek">ἄχαλκος ἀσπίδων, ἄπεπλος φαρέων, ἀψόφητος κωκυμάτων</foreign>, &amp;c. Anaxandrides was a poet of the Middle Comedy, Meineke, <hi rend="italic">Fragm. Com. Att.</hi> Vol. I. p. 367 seq. The line here quoted is Fragm. Inc. XVII, Meineke III 200. Anaxandrides is quoted again, c. 11. 8, an equally uncertain fragment, No. XVIII, and probably again, 11. 10, also 12. 3, and Eth. N. VII 11. <pb n="117"/> </p>
						<p>&lsquo;And that of Polyeuctus to one Speusippus who was paralysed, &ldquo;that he could not keep still (was as restless as ever), though bound (fettered, confined) by fate (or accident) in a pillory- (or stocks-) complaint&rdquo; [&ldquo;bound in a perfect pillory of pain&rdquo;]&rsquo;. </p>
						<p>Polyeuctus, probably of (the Ath. deme) Sphettus, an Attic orator, contemporary with Demosth. and of the same political party, viz. antiMacedonian. See Plut. Vit. Demosth. 846 C, which connects him with Demosthenes. Also, Vit. Parallel. Demosth. c. 10, <foreign lang="greek">ὁ δ’  αὐτὸς φιλόσοφος</foreign> (Ariston of Chios) <foreign lang="greek">Πολύευκτον ἱστορεῖ τὸν Σφήττιον, ἕνα τῶν τότε πολιτευομένων Ἀθήνῃσιν, ἀποφαίνεσθαι μέγιστον μὲν εἶναι ῥήτορα Δημοσθένη κ.τ.λ.</foreign> A short account of him is to be found in Smith's <hi rend="italic">Biogr.

There are six of the name mentioned in the Orators&mdash;Sauppe <hi rend="italic">Index Nominum</hi> (<hi rend="italic">ad Or. Att.</hi>) III 117.&mdash;It is uncertain whether the P. who appears in Dem. c. Mid. &sect; 139 is the same as he of Sphettus. Sauppe distinguishes them: Buttmann, ad loc. Mid. 560. 2, has this note: &ldquo;Orator temporis illius, praeter hanc Midiae defensionem, cum Demosthene coniunctissimus, si credimus Ruhnkenio, qui eundem putat ac Sphettium. Augerus non item;&rdquo; nor, apparently, Sauppe [nor Arnold Schaefer, <hi rend="italic">Dem. u. s. Zeit</hi>, II. p. 100, who elsewhere quotes Dem. Phil. III. &sect; 72, <foreign lang="greek">Πολύευκτος ὁ βέλτιστος οὑτοσί</foreign> (of the Sphettian)]. The speaker quoted by Ar. was doubtless the best known of them, the Sphettian. See the reff. in Westermann, <hi rend="italic">Gesch. der Beredts.</hi> &sect; 53, 5, 6. </p>
						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ἀποπληκτικός, ἀπόπληκτος</lemma>, one who has received a shock or <hi rend="italic">stroke</hi> (as of palsy), which has driven him away from (<foreign lang="greek">ἀπό</foreign>) himself and his normal condition, and so disabled, paralysed, him: of an &lsquo;apoplectic stroke&rsquo;, but not here; also, like <foreign lang="greek">ἐκπλήττεσθαι</foreign>, to be startled out of one's wits, or driven mad, <hi rend="italic">attonitus.</hi> I have followed Victorius in the interpretation of the saying; that Speusippus, though his body was now paralysed, and motionless as if he had been fastened in the stocks or pillory&mdash;or worse, in an instrument that confined his head, hands, and feet&mdash;had his mind as restless and excitable as ever. </p>
						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">πεντεσύριγγος</lemma> is a transfer from a wooden instrument with five &lsquo;pipes&rsquo; or holes, kept in the prison for the punishment of refractory prisoners, which confined at once the head, hands, and feet, to a disorder which paralyses and deprives of motion. Arist. Eq. 1049, <foreign lang="greek">δῆσαί ς’  ἐκέλευε πεντεσυρίγγῳ ξύλῳ. πέντε ὀπὰς ἔχοντι, δἰ ὧν οἵ τε πόδες καὶ αἱ χεῖρες καὶ ὁ τράχηλος ἀνεβάλλετο</foreign>.&rdquo; Schol. ad loc. <foreign lang="greek">πεντεσυρίγγῳ ξύλῳ, τῷ ποδοκάκῃ· πέντε γὰρ ὀπὰς ἔχει, δἰ ὧν</foreign>...

He says &ldquo;Suidas is wrong in taking this (<foreign lang="greek">π. ξ</foreign>) to be synonymous with the <foreign lang="greek">ποδοκάκκη</foreign>:&rdquo; but does not tell us why, or upon what authority (probably on account of the name, <foreign lang="greek">ποδο-κάκη</foreign>). </p>
						<p>&lsquo;And Cephisodotus called the triremes parti-coloured (gaily-painted) (mills i. e.) millstones&rsquo; from their crushing and grinding (exactions and oppressions) the Athenian tributaries and others. Comp. on this expression III 6. 1, as an instance of a &ldquo;privative epithet&rdquo;, the note on that section, near the end. On <foreign lang="greek">ποικίλους</foreign>, Victorius quotes Virg. Georg. IV 289, <hi rend="italic">pictis phaselis</hi> [cf. St John's <hi rend="italic">Hellenes</hi> III 302]. On Cephisodotus, <foreign lang="greek">ὁ λεπτός, ὁ ἐκ Κεραμέων</foreign>, see note on III 4. 4. </p>

He receives this name from the little boys or the bystanders in several of Diogenes' (Laert.) stories about him. A long list of his sayings, often witty, but usually bitter and sarcastic, is to be found in Diogenes Laertius' Life. This does not appear amongst them. </p>

Athenaeus continues <foreign lang="greek">tπερίδης δὲ ἐν τῷ κατὰ Πατροκλέους...τοὺς Ἀρεοπαγίτας φησὶν ἀριστήσαντά τινα ἐν καπηλείῳ κωλῦσαι ἀνιέναι εἰς Ἄρειον πάγον. σὺ δέ, ὦ σοφιστά, ἐν τοῖς καπηλείοις συναναφύρῃ οὐ μεθ’  ἑταίρων, ἀλλὰ μετὰ ἑταιρῶν κ.τ.λ.</foreign> Plut.

These extracts descriptive of the character of these taverns will throw some light upon Diogenes' pleasantry.</note>. These scenes of riot, drunkenness, and licentiousness, says the satirical Diogenes, are what the Athenians call <hi rend="italic">their</hi> <foreign lang="greek">συσσίτια</foreign>; this is <hi rend="italic">their</hi> substitute for (or representative of) the sober and orderly Spartan <foreign lang="greek">φιδίτια</foreign>. See the description in Grote, <hi rend="italic">H. G.</hi> II 513 [chap. VI], M&uuml;ller, <hi rend="italic">Dor.</hi> IV 3, on the meals of the Dorians. <foreign lang="greek">φιδίτια</foreign>, or as it is usually written <foreign lang="greek">φειδίτια</foreign>, is the name given by the Spartans to what the Athenians and others called <foreign lang="greek">συσσίτια</foreign>, the public tables or messes at which all the citizens dined in common. M&uuml;ller, u. s. &sect; 3, II 294 Lewis' Transl.), remarks, note 2, &ldquo;It is very probable that this <foreign lang="greek">φειδίτια</foreign>, <pb n="119"/> (<hi rend="italic">spare</hi> or <hi rend="italic">scanty meals</hi>) was a ludicrous distortion of an ancient Spartan name <foreign lang="greek">φιλίτια</foreign>, i. e. <hi rend="italic">love-feasts.</hi>&rdquo; This is made still more probable by the fact that Ar. in his Politics always writes the word <foreign lang="greek">φιδίτιατὰ συσσίτια τὰ καλούμενα φιδίτια</foreign>, II 9, 1271 <hi rend="italic">a</hi> 27, Ib. 10, 1272 <hi rend="italic">a</hi> 2, c. 11, 1272 <hi rend="italic">b</hi> 34&mdash;and the constant interchange of <hi rend="italic">d</hi> and <hi rend="italic">l</hi> (<foreign lang="greek">δάκρυ</foreign>, <hi rend="italic">lacrima;</hi> <foreign lang="greek">Ὀδυσσεύς</foreign>, <hi rend="italic">Ulysses</hi>). They were originally called <foreign lang="greek">ἀνδρεῖα</foreign>, <hi rend="italic">men's meals</hi>, both by Cretans and Spartans, the institution being common to both peoples, the Spartan being in this, as in other particulars, borrowed from the Cretan. Pol. II 10, 1272 <hi rend="italic">a</hi> 2, <foreign lang="greek">καὶ συσσίτια παρ’  ἀμφοτέροις ἐστίν· καὶ τό γε ἀρχαῖον ἐκάλουν οἱ Λάκωνες οὐ φιδίτια ἀλλ̓ ἄνδρια, καθάπερ οἱ Κρῆτες, ᾗ καὶ δῆλον ὅτι ἐκεῖθεν ἐλήλυθεν</foreign>. And of the Carthaginian constitution, Ib. c. 11, 1272 <hi rend="italic">b</hi> 34, <foreign lang="greek">ἔχει δὲ παραπλήσια τῇ Λακ. πολιτείᾳ τὰ μὲν συσσίτια τῶν ἑταιριῶν τοῖς φιδιτίοις κ.τ.λ.</foreign> </p>
						<p>&lsquo;And Aesion, that (the Athenians) had emptied (or drained) their entire city into Sicily&rsquo;. Meaning, that the Athenian forces sent over for the invasion of Sicily in 415&mdash;413 B. C. were so enormous in proportion to the population of Athens, that they might be said to have completely drained it. &lsquo;For this is a metaphor, and sets the thing before our eyes&rsquo;. </p>
						<p>Aesion's name occurs, but only as the father of Euctemon, in Demosth. Mid. &sect; 165. Also in a citation from Hermippus, in Plut. Vit. Demosth. (Vit. Parall.) c. 11, in which he compares Demosthenes' speeches, especially for <hi rend="italic">reading</hi>, advantageously with those of his predecessors. The only other notice of him that I have been able to find is Suidas s. v. <foreign lang="greek">Δημοσθένης</foreign>: which is merely that he (Dem.) <foreign lang="greek">συνεφιλολόγησε Αἰσίωνι τῷ Ἀθηναίῳ</foreign>; which implies community of studies. He was therefore an Athenian orator, contemporary with Demosthenes. </p>
						<p>&lsquo;And&rsquo;&mdash;Aesion again&mdash;&ldquo;so that Greece cried aloud&rdquo;: this again is in some sense a metaphor, and a vivid expression&rsquo;. A metaphor no doubt (though Victorius says it is a mere <hi rend="italic">hypallage</hi>), since it <hi rend="italic">transfers</hi> the voice from an individual to a collective people, or country. It is <foreign lang="greek">πρὸ ὀμμάτων</foreign> in that it animates an inanimate object, or abstraction; c. 11. 2, 3. Demosthenes has used this twice, de F. L. &sect; 92, <foreign lang="greek">ἡ γὰρ ἀλήθεια καὶ τὰ πεπραγμένα αὐτὰ βοᾷ</foreign>, and &sect; 129, <foreign lang="greek">ταῦτ’  οὐχὶ βοᾷ καὶ λέγει ὅτι χρήματ̓ εἴληφεν Αἰσχίνης</foreign>: and a very near approach to it, Olynth. <foreign lang="greek">ά</foreign> &sect; 2, <foreign lang="greek">ὁ μὲν οὖν παρὼν καιρός...μόνον οὐχὶ λέγει φωνὴν ἀφιεὶς ὅτι κ.τ.λ.</foreign> Aesch. Agam. 1106 (Dind.), <foreign lang="greek">πᾶσα γὰρ πόλις βοᾷ</foreign>. Eur. Hippol. 877, <foreign lang="greek">βοᾷ βοᾷ δέλτος ἄλαστα</foreign>. </p>
						<p>&lsquo;And as Cephisodotus bade (the Athenians) take care not to convert many of their mobs into assemblies&rsquo; (<hi rend="italic">lit.</hi> their mobs, in any numbers). Cephisodotus we have had three times already as the author of pointed sayings, III 4. 3, and 10. 6, <hi rend="italic">bis.</hi> The point of this saying seems to lie in the word <foreign lang="greek">συνδρομάς</foreign>, which is substituted for <foreign lang="greek">συγκλήτους ἐκκλησίας</foreign>. It implies that most of their ordinary assemblies are mere mobs, tumultuary gatherings, riotous and unruly, instead of <foreign lang="greek">σύγκλητοι</foreign>, regularly convoked for special occasions in due form and order. It would certainly be <pb n="120"/> better without <foreign lang="greek">ἐκκλησίας</foreign>, as Wolf proposes. It would then mean &ldquo;not to hold their&mdash;mobs too frequently.&rdquo; Both Bekker and Spengel retain the <hi rend="italic">vulgata lectio:</hi> the latter with a comma between <foreign lang="greek">συνδρομὰς</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">ἐκκλησίας</foreign>. </p>
						<p>&lsquo;And Isocrates, &ldquo;to those that flock together promiscuously (scramble, as it were) in the general festivals&rdquo;&rsquo;. This is an expression of precisely the same import as the preceding. It occurs in Isocr. Phil. &sect; 12, and runs thus, <foreign lang="greek">ὅτι τὸ μὲν ταῖς πανηγύρεσιν ἐνοχλεῖν καὶ πρὸς ἅπαντας λέγειν τοὺς συντρέχοντας ἐν αὐταῖς πρὸς οὐδένα λέγειν ἐστίν, κ.τ.λ.</foreign> </p>
						<p>&lsquo;And the example in the Funeral Oration, that &ldquo;Greece might well have her hair cut off (go into mourning) over the tomb of those that died at Salamis, for her freedom and their valour were buried in the same grave&rdquo;: for had he only said &ldquo;that she might well weep for the virtue that lay buried with them&rdquo;, it would have been a metaphor and a graphic touch, but the (addition of) &ldquo;freedom with the virtue&rdquo; carries with it a kind of antithesis&rsquo;. This really affecting passage, which Aristotle has partially spoiled by omission and alteration, runs thus in the original&mdash; the funeral oration attributed to Lysias<note anchored="yes">This speech is condemned as spurious by [Dobree and] Baiter and Sauppe [and also by Blass, <hi rend="italic">die Attische Beredsamkeit</hi>, I p. 431, and Jebb, <hi rend="italic">Attic Orators</hi>, I p. 208. It contains some close parallels to the Panegyric of Isocrates and would appear to have been written by one of the pupils of that rhetorician, from whom Ar. (it will be observed) takes the quotation just preceding the present passage]. Let us hear on the other side Mr Grote, <hi rend="italic">Hist. Gr.</hi> vol. VI [chap. XLVIII] p. 191, note, &ldquo;Of (the funeral orations) as&lt;*&gt;ribed to Plato and Lysias also, the genuineness has been suspected, though upon far less grounds (than that attributed to Demosth.)..... but this harangue of Lysias,  <hi rend="italic">a very fine composition</hi>, may well be his, and may perhaps have been really delivered&mdash;though probably not delivered by him, as he was not a qualified citizen.&rdquo; In this judgment I entirely agree; and it seems to derive some authority from the citation of this extract here, as a specimen of pointed style, which shews that it was at all events well known to Aristotle and the Athenian public, and well remembered, though the author's name is not given; perhaps for this very reason, that the authorship of it <hi rend="italic">was</hi> so well known.</note>, Or. 2, in Baiter and Sauppe's <hi rend="italic">Or. Att.</hi> I 68, &sect; 60: &ldquo;and therefore Greece might well that day cut off her hair over yonder tomb (the orator is on the spot, and points to it) and mourn for those that lie buried here, seeing that her own (the text has <foreign lang="greek">αὐτῶν</foreign>, <hi rend="italic">their</hi> own, the collective <foreign lang="greek">Ἑλλάς</foreign> being resolved into its component members) freedom and their valour are laid together in one grave&rdquo;. Aristotle has very much marred the simple beauty of the sentence (which if it be not Lysias', is at all events quite worthy of him) by his alterations; <pb n="121"/> especially the substitution of the frigid, explanatory, <foreign lang="greek">τῷ τῶν ἐν Σαλαμῖνι</foreign>, for the graphic <foreign lang="greek">τῷδε</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">τότε</foreign> of the original (I here follow Victorius). [The context of the original passage shews that the substitution is really a blunder, as the reference is not to the Athenians who fought at Salamis but to those who died at Aegospotami and elsewhere towards the close of the Peloponnesian war.] </p>
						<p>The metaphor lies of course in the word <foreign lang="greek">κείρασθαι</foreign>, by which Greece is personified and compared to a woman who, according to the national custom, cuts off her hair as a sign of mourning&mdash;on this custom see Becker's <hi rend="italic">Charicles</hi>, p. 398; comp. Eur. Troad. 141, Orest. 458, Alc. 515, Suppl. 97, 974, Hel. 1060, <foreign lang="greek">πένθιμος, πενθήρης, κουρά, κουραί</foreign>. Aesch. Choeph. 6 (Paley's note ad loc.), Hom. Il. XXIII. 142, &amp;c. The last two passages shew that this custom was not absolutely confined to women, though it was especially characteristic of them. In Lysias the personification, which is most tastelessly interrupted by the plural <foreign lang="greek">αὐτῶν</foreign>, is resumed in the next clause, <foreign lang="greek">ὡς δυστυχὴς μὲν ἡ Ἑλλὰς τοιούτων ἀνδρῶν ὀρφανὴ γενομένη κ.τ.λ.</foreign> Here Greece becomes a bereaved mother. </p>
						<p>&lsquo;And as Iphicrates said, &ldquo;the course of my argument cuts right through the middle of Chares' acts&rdquo;: a proportional metaphor; and the &ldquo;right through the middle&rdquo; sets the thing vividly before our eyes&rsquo;. This was said by Iphicrates in the same case as that which is noticed in II 23. 7 (see note), the prosecution, namely, of him and his colleagues Menestheus and Timotheus, together with Chares, who were all brought to trial by Aristophon the Azenian in 355 B. C. on the scrutiny of their accounts, for misconduct in their command during the Social war. Sauppe u. s. p. 191, commenting on this passage, says &ldquo;Iphicrates se et collegas accusatos defendens exponit quam male Chares rem gesserit. Hoc facturus dixit, iter orationes suae ferre per medias Charetis res gestas, <hi rend="italic">quasi de itinere per hostium fines faciundo</hi> diceret.&rdquo; The <hi rend="italic">proportion</hi> of the metaphor is this: As a road is carried, or an army or expedition marched, right into the heart of an enemy's country, so Iphicrates in his defence carried hostility and destruction (exposure and censure) into Chares' conduct during their joint command. </p>
						<p>&lsquo;And the saying, &ldquo;to invite dangers to the help (rescue, remedy) of dangers&rdquo; is a vivid metaphor&rsquo;. The author, and occasion, of this sentence are alike unknown. I have followed Schrader in the translation. To rid yourself of one danger another must often be invoked or invited, as a man saves himself from a shipwrecked vessel by throwing himself overboard and clinging to a plank. He also quotes Florus, I. 17, <hi rend="italic">Fabius Maximus periculosissimum bellum bello explicavit.</hi> The metaphor lies in <foreign lang="greek">παρακαλεῖν</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">βοηθήσοντας</foreign>, which are transferred from men to dangers, which are thereby &lsquo;animated&rsquo;; <foreign lang="greek">τὸ ἄψυχον</foreign> becomes <foreign lang="greek">ἔμψυχον</foreign>. <pb n="122"/> </p>
						<p>&lsquo;And (what) Lycoleon (said) in his defence of Chabrias, &ldquo;not even awed by that symbol of his supplication, the bronze image (yonder)&rdquo;&rsquo;. Of Lycoleon nothing seems to be known, beyond what may be gathered from this passage, that he was an Athenian orator, and defended Chabrias in his trial B. C. 366. </p>
						<p>The circumstances referred to are briefly these. In 366 B. C. Chabrias was brought to trial with Callistratus, the orator, on a charge of misconduct leading to the loss of Oropus. See <hi rend="italic">ante</hi>, note ad I 7. 13. Grote, <hi rend="italic">Hist. Gr.</hi> X [chap. LXXIX] pp. 392, 3, and note 3<note anchored="yes">Diog. Laert., III 3. 24, says that Plato also was engaged in the defence of Chabrias, no one else daring to undertake it. See Grote's <hi rend="italic">Plato</hi>, I 128, note i.</note>. Chabrias had greatly distinguished himself on a former occasion, described in Grote, <hi rend="italic">Hist. Gr.</hi> X [chap. LXXVII] pp. 172, 3, in an action near Thebes fought against Agesilaus and the Lacedaemonians, 378 B. C. Agesilaus &ldquo;was daunted by the firm attitude and excellent array of the troops of Chabrias. They had received orders to await his approach on a high and advantageous ground, without moving until signal should be given; with their shields resting on the knee, and their spears protruded&rdquo; (Diodorus, XV. 33, Cornelius Nepos, Chabr. c. 1, <hi rend="italic">obnixo genu scuto</hi>). &ldquo;The Athenian public having afterwards voted a statue in his honour, he made choice of this attitude for the design.&rdquo; Ib. 173, note 1. This is also referred to, the details being passed over, in Dem. c. Lept., in a long enumeration of all Chabrias' services to his country, &sect;&sect; 75&mdash;78; <foreign lang="greek">πρὸς ἅπαντας Πελοποννησίους παρετάξατο ἐν Θήβαις</foreign>, &sect; 76. See also Wolf, ad loc. p. 479. 25 (Sch&auml;fer, <hi rend="italic">Appar. ad Dem.</hi> III 168). Lycoleon in his speech points to this statue which stood in the <foreign lang="greek">ἀγορά</foreign> in sight of the court, and taking advantage of the posture of it, which he interprets as that of a suppliant, appeals from it to the feelings of the judges, at the same time reminding them of the merits of the original. The effect no doubt must have been very striking. The <hi rend="italic">metaphor</hi> resides in <foreign lang="greek">ἱκετηρίαν</foreign>, which is transferred from the suppliant's olive-branch (<foreign lang="greek">ἐλαίαν</foreign>) to a suppliant attitude in general, implied in the posture of the kneeling figure. On the accusative of the object of awe with <foreign lang="greek">αἰσχύνεσθαι</foreign>, see note on II 2. 22. </p>
						<p>&lsquo;For it was a metaphor at the moment (whilst Lycoleon was speaking and Chabrias was in actual danger), but not for ever (i. e. so long, and no longer; not permanently), but yet perpetually (repeat <foreign lang="greek">ἀεί</foreign>, Schrader) before the eyes (vivid and graphic): for it is only while he (Chabrias) is in danger that the image seems to supplicate, but the inanimate is ever animated&mdash;&ldquo;the monument of his deeds for the city&rdquo;&rsquo;. </p>
						<p>This very obscure sentence seems intended as an explanatory com<pb n="123"/> mentary on the preceding extract. It is truly <hi rend="italic">obscurum per obscurius</hi>, a masterpiece of Aristotelian brevity, and a complete illustration of the Horatian <hi rend="italic">brevis esse laboro, obscurus fio.</hi> I follow Schrader and Victorius in the interpretation. First he says that there is a metaphor: this of course is in the word <foreign lang="greek">ἱκετηρίαν</foreign>, as above explained. But the metaphorical application of it only continues during the danger of the person represented; when that is over, and the suppliant out of danger, the statue loses indeed the suppliant character with which it was invested for the time by the application of Lycoleon, but retains the posture and its associations as &ldquo;the memorial of his services to the state.&rdquo; (I agree with Victorius in supposing that this is a continuation of the extract, and <foreign lang="greek">τὸ ὑπόμνημα</foreign> therefore in apposition with <foreign lang="greek">τὴν εἰκόνα τὴν χαλκῆν</foreign>. He ingeniously suggests an alternative, that it may be a second extract from the same speech, <hi rend="italic">alibi in eadem causa</hi>, and another example of a pointed and graphic saying.) <foreign lang="greek">κινδυνεύοντος γάρ...ἡ εἰκών</foreign> is the explanation of <foreign lang="greek">ἀλλ’  οὐκ ἀεί</foreign>, and <foreign lang="greek">τὸ ἄψυχον ἔμψυχον</foreign> of <foreign lang="greek">πρὸ ὀμμάτων</foreign>. Comp. c. 11. 2, 3, a vivid representation gives <hi rend="italic">animation</hi> to <hi rend="italic">inanimate</hi> objects. If this explanation be correct we must read <foreign lang="greek">δέ</foreign> for <foreign lang="greek">δή</foreign>: by which the explanation of <foreign lang="greek">ἀλλ’  οὐκ ἀεί</foreign> is <hi rend="italic">contrasted</hi> with that of <foreign lang="greek">πρὸ ὀμμάτων. δή</foreign> is retained by all the Edd., but I cannot discover any sense in which it is here applicable. It seems also that <foreign lang="greek">ὑπέρ</foreign> has dropt out in the phrase <foreign lang="greek">τὸ ὑπόμν. τῶν</foreign> (<foreign lang="greek">ὑπὲρ</foreign>) <foreign lang="greek">τῆς πόλεως ἔργων. ὑπόμνημα</foreign> occurs in the same sense, Isocr. Paneg. &sect; 156, and de Pace &sect; 124. </p>
						<p>&lsquo;And, &ldquo;in every way practising (or studying) meanness of spirit&rdquo;, for <hi rend="italic">studying</hi> is a kind of <hi rend="italic">increasing</hi> or <hi rend="italic">promoting.</hi>&rsquo; <foreign lang="greek">μελετᾶν</foreign> being a &lsquo;kind&rsquo;, <foreign lang="greek">εἶδος</foreign>, of <foreign lang="greek">αὔξειν</foreign>, the metaphor is one <foreign lang="greek">ἀπὸ τοῦ εἴδους ἐπὶ γένος</foreign>, Poet. XXI 7, one of the four kinds of metaphor. &lsquo;To study&rsquo; therefore, which is one kind of the genus &lsquo;promoting&rsquo;, is here put metaphorically for the general term &lsquo;to promote&rsquo;. And the <hi rend="italic">point</hi> of the metaphor lies in the unusual application of &lsquo;study&rsquo;: a man usually studies or takes pains to promote some worthy object, to cultivate some virtue: here the object is an unworthy one, a vice or defect. This is taken from Isocr. Paneg. &sect; 151, in a note on which passage Coraes ingeniously proposed to read <foreign lang="greek">ἀσκεῖν</foreign> for <foreign lang="greek">αὔξειν</foreign> in Aristotle's comment on <foreign lang="greek">μελετᾶν</foreign>. </p>
						<p>&lsquo;And &ldquo;that God kindled (lit up) reason as a light in the soul&rdquo;: for both of them shew something (make things clear and visible)&rsquo;. This is a proportional metaphor. As light to material, so reason to intellectual objects. <hi rend="italic">Cuius haec verba sunt nondum repperi</hi>, says Victorius, and no subsequent commentator has supplied the deficiency. </p>
						<p>&lsquo;(The peaces that we make are nugatory) for we do not put an end to <pb n="124"/> wars (do away with them altogether), but merely postpone them&rsquo;. This also comes from Isocr. Paneg. &sect; 172. &lsquo;For both of them look to the future (to future results), both actual postponement (in its proper sense and application) and a peace of that kind&rsquo;. This therefore is a metaphor from <foreign lang="greek">εἶδος</foreign> to <foreign lang="greek">εἶδος</foreign>, from one kind of postponement, to another, analogous, kind. </p>
						<p>&lsquo;And to say &ldquo;that the treaty is a far fairer trophy than those which are obtained in wars: for the one is for the sake of (to commemorate) a trifling success and a single chance, but <hi rend="italic">this</hi> for (on behalf of, marking the issue of,) the entire war&rdquo;: for both of them are signs of victory&rsquo;. Isocr. Paneg. &sect; 180, quoted by Aristotle, as Mr Sandys says in his note, <hi rend="italic">memoriter.</hi> <foreign lang="greek">μιᾶς τύχης</foreign> is <hi rend="italic">explained</hi> by Isocr. Antid. &sect; 128. It is &lsquo;a single stroke of fortune&rsquo;, a mere lucky accident, as opposed to a <hi rend="italic">series of successes</hi>, which prove design, skill, and knowledge. (<foreign lang="greek">ὅτι</foreign>, the mark of quotation). &lsquo;Again, &ldquo;Cities pay a heavy reckoning (render a terrible account, for their misdeeds) to (or by?) the censure of mankind.&rdquo; For the &ldquo;account&rdquo; or &ldquo;reckoning&rdquo; is a legal damage or punishment&rsquo;. The explanation shews, first, (as Bernays also remarks, <hi rend="italic">Dialog. des Arist.</hi> p. 16,) that <foreign lang="greek">εὔθυνα</foreign> here expresses not merely the account itself that is rendered, but the penalty consequent upon it, if unsatisfactory: and secondly, that the metaphor is a transfer from the legal and particular scrutiny or account rendered by the officer on laying down his command, and extended from this to an account or scrutiny <hi rend="italic">in general</hi>, the penalty paid by whole cities to the judgment and censure of mankind and posterity: consequently it is a metaphor from <foreign lang="greek">εἶδος</foreign> to <foreign lang="greek">γένος</foreign>, from species to genus. The passage referred to in Bernays' treatise will furnish a commentary on the use and signification of <foreign lang="greek">εὐθύνας</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">λόγον</foreign> or <foreign lang="greek">λόγους διδόναι</foreign>, pp. 15, 16. </p>
						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">εὔθυνα</lemma>] This, according to some authorities, as B&ouml;ckh and L. Dindorf, is the only true Attic form of the word, <foreign lang="greek">εὐθύνη</foreign> belonging to the later Greek. G. Dindorf writes <foreign lang="greek">εὐθῦναι</foreign>, Dem. Olynth. <foreign lang="greek">ά</foreign>. 17. 15, and B&ouml;ckh, <hi rend="italic">Publ. Econ.</hi> Bk. II, ch. 8, note 177, <foreign lang="greek">εὔθυνα, εὔθυναι</foreign> (p. 190 Lewis' Transl.), Sch&auml;fer (<hi rend="italic">App. Crit.</hi> p. 229) note on the passage of Dem. Shilleto on Dem. de F. L. &sect; 19, not. crit., acknowledges both plurals, <foreign lang="greek">εὔθυναι</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">εὐθῦναι</foreign>: &ldquo;<foreign lang="greek">εὐθύναι</foreign>, quod nihili est...&rdquo; The Zurich Editors have <foreign lang="greek">εὔθυναι</foreign>. In Lysias <foreign lang="greek">κατὰ Θεομνήστου β́  9, εὔθυναν</foreign> is found without various reading. The parallel form <foreign lang="greek">ἄμυνα</foreign>, <hi rend="italic">ultio</hi>, is cited by Phrynichus p. 23 (Lobeck) as forbidden; also by Moeris and Thomas Magister. It is however approved by Timaeus (p. 26 Ruhnken). Ruhnken in his note indignantly denies the use of the word in Plato, and refers it to the later Greek. <pb n="125"/> </p>
						<p>&lsquo;And so we have despatched the subject of the pointed sayings that are derived from the proportional metaphor and by the vivid graphic language that sets things described before your eyes (presents them vividly to your mind's eye, as it were to the actual sense)&rsquo;. </p>
						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">εἴρηται</lemma>] is done, and over, and enough of it. Note on I 11. 29. </p>

					<p>This chapter is in continuation of the subject of the preceding, <foreign lang="greek">τὸ ἀστεῖον</foreign>; first as it is exemplified in <foreign lang="greek">τὸ πρὸ ὀμμάτων ποιεῖν</foreign>, and next in jokes, puns, plays upon words, and verbal pleasantries of all kinds, metaphors and similes; and lastly hyperboles, which are also a kind of metaphor. All these may be employed in imparting &lsquo;vivacity&rsquo; to style. Whately, <hi rend="italic">Rhet.</hi> c. 3, on Style, following Aristotle, calls <foreign lang="greek">τὸ πρὸ ὀμμάτων ποιεῖν</foreign>, &lsquo;energy&rsquo;.

						<p>&lsquo;I mean then that things are <hi rend="italic">set before our eyes</hi> by all expressions that indicate realized activity. For instance; to say that a good man is &lsquo;square&rsquo; (i. e. complete) is a metaphor; for both are complete, but still don't signify a state of realized action (or activity). On the other hand, the phrase &ldquo;with his vigour and prime in full bloom&rdquo; (Isocr. Phil. &sect; 10) does convey the notion of life and activity, as is also, &ldquo;but thee, free to roam at large&rdquo; (Ib. &sect; 127); and again, in the verse, &ldquo;so thereupon the Greeks (with a rush) darting forward with the spear&rdquo;&rsquo; (<foreign lang="greek">δορί</foreign>, Eur. Iph. Aul. 80: I believe the otiose <foreign lang="greek">ποσί</foreign> to be a mere misquotation of Ar.), &lsquo;the word &lsquo;darting forward&rsquo; is at once life-like and metaphorical&rsquo;. </p>

						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">τετράγωνος</lemma> comes from Simonides&mdash;or rather from the Pythagoreans, who by a square number or figure symbolized (or, as Aristotle tells us, Met. A, actually identified it with) completeness, and perfect equality in <pb n="126"/> the shape of justice. It was their type of perfection. Bergk, <hi rend="italic">Fr. Lyr.

						<p>The second extract quoted from Isocr. Phil. &sect; 127 requires the context to justify its selection as an example of animated style; with that, it becomes very striking. The orator is contrasting the entire freedom of view which Philip's commanding position allows him, as compared with the narrow patriotism enforced upon those who are &lsquo;fast bound&rsquo; in the constitution and laws of their native cities; which he expresses by <foreign lang="greek">σὲ δ’  ὥσπερ ἄφετον γεγενημένον ἅπασαν τὴν Ἑλλάδα πατρίδα νομίζειν κ.τ.λ.</foreign>&mdash;a flight quite beyond Isocrates' ordinary range of imagination. The metaphor is of course derived from the sacred cattle which were devoted to the worship of some god, and left free from the ordinary labours of the plough and cart, to roam and graze at large in the sacred precincts, the <foreign lang="greek">τέμενος</foreign> of his temple. See Plat. Protag. 320 A, Rep. VI 498 C, and the notes of the Comm.: Aesch. Prom. Vinct. 666, 684 (Paley) and the note there (also Blomfield's Glossary, 687), Eur. Ion 822, <foreign lang="greek">ὁ δ’  ἐν θεοῦ δόμοισιν ἄφετος, ὡς λάθοι, παιδεύεται</foreign>. </p>
						<p>The difference between the mere metaphor <foreign lang="greek">τετράγωνος</foreign>, and the metaphor which also vivifies and animates, is this: in a square there is neither life nor action; in &lsquo;blooming&rsquo; we have the life of a plant, in <foreign lang="greek">ἄφετον</foreign> of an animal, in <foreign lang="greek">ᾄξαντες</foreign> the vigour and impetuosity of living human beings. </p>

						<p>&lsquo;And Homer's frequent employment of the figure which invests inanimate objects with life and motion by the medium of the metaphor. But in all of them it is by representing (objects) as animated&mdash;setting them as it were in <hi rend="italic">action</hi>&mdash;that he distinguishes himself (acquires his popularity, secures our approbation): in the following for instance: &ldquo;again (this belongs to the preceding sentence: <foreign lang="greek">αὖθις· ἔπειτα πέδονδε κυλίνδετο λᾶας ἀναιδὴς</foreign> is the reading of Homer, Od. XI 598): then to the plain rolled the ruthless (remorseless) stone&rdquo;&rsquo; [&ldquo;Downward anon to the valley the boulder remorselessly bounded&rdquo;]. The animating metaphor is of course in <foreign lang="greek">ἀναιδής</foreign>, which attributes not only life, but also shamelessness, recklessness, remorselessness, want of mercy and proper feeling, to the stone. Whately, u.s., ingeniously, but not correctly: &lsquo;provoking&rsquo;, mocking Sisyphus' efforts, <foreign lang="greek">ἀναιδῆ</foreign>, in the same sense, ruthless, pitiless, Soph. <pb n="127"/> Oed. Col. 516. <foreign lang="greek">αἰδώς</foreign>, <hi rend="italic">clementia, misericordia</hi>, opposed to <foreign lang="greek">θρασύς</foreign>, <hi rend="italic">crudelis</hi>, Elmsl. ad Med. 461. This line has always been quoted as an example of &ldquo;the sound an echo to the sense.&rdquo; </p>
						<p>&lsquo;And, &ldquo;the arrow flew&rdquo;&mdash;like a bird&rsquo;&mdash;Hom. Il. N [XIII] 587. </p>
						<p>&lsquo;And, &ldquo;raging or yearning to fly to its mark&rdquo;&rsquo;. Il. <foreign lang="greek">Δ</foreign> [IV] 126. This attributes human feelings and passions to the arrow, <foreign lang="greek">ὀϊστός</foreign>. He might have added <foreign lang="greek">ἅλτο</foreign> in line 125. </p>
						<p>&lsquo;And, (sc. <foreign lang="greek">τὰ δοῦρα θρασειάων ἀπὸ χειρῶν</foreign>) &ldquo;longing to taste blood&rdquo; (more lit. &lsquo;to take their fill of flesh&rsquo;)&rsquo;. Il. <foreign lang="greek">Λ</foreign> [XI] 574, Paley ad loc. </p>
						<p>&lsquo;And &ldquo;the spear-point panting, quivering in its eagerness, rushed through his breast&rdquo;&rsquo;. </p>
						<p>On these extracts, Whately, <hi rend="italic">Rhet.</hi> u. s., note, well observes, &ldquo;that there is a peculiar aptitude in some of these expressions: an arrow or dart from it flying with a spinning motion quivers violently when it is fixed; thus suggesting the idea of one quivering with eagerness&rdquo;. This is particularly applicable to the two last extracts. In the third, <foreign lang="greek">ἵσταντο</foreign> may help to convey this. The darts which fell short of their aim, struck, were fixed, in the ground, and there stood quivering. &ldquo;And winged the shaft that quivered in his heart&rdquo;. Byron (of Kirke White), in <hi rend="italic">English Bards and Scotch Reviewers.</hi> Gaisford, in <hi rend="italic">Variorum not.</hi> p. 426, adds Od. <foreign lang="greek">έ 175, νῆες, ἀγαλλόμεναι</foreign> (exulting) <foreign lang="greek">Διὸς οὔρῳ</foreign>. Eustath. ad loc. <foreign lang="greek">καὶ ὁρᾷ τὸ ἀγαλλόμεναι, ὡς ἐπὶ ἐμψύχων τῶν νεῶν λεχθέν</foreign>. Soph. Aj. 581, <foreign lang="greek">πρὸς τομῶντι πήματι</foreign>, and this Schol., <foreign lang="greek">τομῆς ἐπιθυμεῖν, ὥσπερ εἰ αἴσθησιν εἶχεν</foreign>. Plut. on Pyth. 398 A. See also in Heitz, <hi rend="italic">Verl. Schrift. Arist.</hi> pp. 278, 9, some passages from the Schol. to Homer, and that of Plutarch, on this peculiarity of Homer. </p>
						<p>&lsquo;For in all these by reason of the living character (with which they are invested) they appear to be in action: for &ldquo;shameless conduct&rdquo;, and &ldquo;quivering with eagerness&rdquo; and the rest, all express forms of activity (implying life). But these he has applied to them through the medium of the proportional metaphor, for as the stone is to Sisyphus, so is the shameless actor to him who is shamelessly treated&rsquo;. <pb n="128"/> </p>
						<p>I am sorry to be obliged to differ from our author in the view he here takes of the meaning of <foreign lang="greek">ἀναιδής</foreign>. The notion of &ldquo;reckless impudence&rdquo;, conveyed by his equivalent <foreign lang="greek">ἀναίσχυντος</foreign>, seems to me altogether alien from the Homeric conception of it. I can't think that &ldquo;reckless impudence&rdquo;, <foreign lang="greek">ἀναισχυντία</foreign>, is what <hi rend="italic">Homer</hi> meant to attribute to the stone when he called it <foreign lang="greek">ἀναιδής</foreign>, but &lsquo;unmerciful treatment&rsquo;. At all events it is better than Pope's &ldquo;huge round stone.&rdquo; </p>
					</div3>
					<div3 id="b3c11s4" type="section" n="4">
						<p>&lsquo;In his most approved similes too (as well as metaphors) he deals thus (employs this treatment) with inanimate things (<foreign lang="greek">ἐπί</foreign> &lsquo;in the case of&rsquo; upon, applying to): &ldquo;(Waves) arched, foam-crested, some in front, others (turnbling) after them&rdquo;; for he draws (depicts) them all as living and moving, and living activity is a kind of motion&rsquo;. Il. N [XIII] 799, [&lsquo;the waves of the bellowing ocean; Bending their heads foam-crested, they sweep on, billow on billow&rsquo;]. The following verse will shew where the <foreign lang="greek">ἐνέργεια</foreign> lies; <foreign lang="greek">ὣς Τρῶες πρὸ μὲν ἄλλοι ἀρηρότες, αὐτὰρ ἐπ’  ἄλλοι, χαλκῷ μαρμαίροντες ἅμ̓ ἡγεμόνεσσιν ἕποντο</foreign>. </p>
						<p>I have followed Bekker (Ed. 3) and Spengel in reading <foreign lang="greek">κίνησις</foreign> for <foreign lang="greek">μίμησις</foreign>, from a conjecture of Bekker in his first ed. <foreign lang="greek">μίμησις</foreign> will however make good sense. </p>

						<p>&lsquo;Metaphors should be drawn, as has been stated before, (III 2. 12, and 10. 5, also 11. 10; <foreign lang="greek">οἰκείων</foreign> in the former, <foreign lang="greek">μὴ φανερῶν</foreign> implied in the words <foreign lang="greek">μήτ’  ἐπιπόλαιον</foreign>, in the latter,) from objects closely related, but not obvious to every one at first sight&rsquo; (i. e. not so related, so clearly resembling one another, that no one can fail to see the resemblance at once: such metaphors do not pique the curiosity, and set people thinking; and from them you <hi rend="italic">learn</hi> nothing, that you did not know before); &lsquo;just as in philosophy also, to observe the resemblances in widely distant things is characteristic of a sagacious penetrating intellect: like Archytas' saying, that arbitrator and altar were the same thing; because both are the refuge of the injured or wronged&rsquo; (thing or person, animal or man, expressed by the <hi rend="italic">neuter</hi>). </p>
						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">οἷον καὶ ἐν φιλοσοφίᾳ</lemma>] Poet. XXII 17, <foreign lang="greek">μόνον γὰρ τοῦτο οὔτε παρ’  ἄλλου ἐστὶ λαβεῖν εὐφυΐας τε σημεῖόν ἐστιν</foreign> (this is equivalent to <foreign lang="greek">εὐστόχου</foreign>, &lsquo;requires quick wit, penetration, natural sagacity&rsquo;)' <foreign lang="greek">τὸ γὰρ εὖ μεταφέρειν τὸ τὸ ὅμοιον θεωρεῖν ἐστίν</foreign>.

On the use of resemblances and differences in defining, distinguishing, and the formation of concepts, see Trendelenburg, ad Categ. &sect; 59 p. 137, and Sir W. Hamilton, <hi rend="italic">Lectures on Logic</hi>, Vol. I p. 102, Lect. VI. This is the kind of &lsquo;philosophy&rsquo; here referred to. Diotima's account, Pl. Symp. 211, of the formation of general conceptions or ideas will serve as an illustration. </p>

						<p>&lsquo;Or if one were to say that an anchor and a hook were the same: for they are both the same kind of thing, but differ in position&rsquo; (<hi rend="italic">lit.</hi> &lsquo;the above and below&rsquo;). </p>
						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">κρεμάθρα</lemma> is defined by the Schol. on Ar. Nub. 218, and by Suidas, as a basket for remnants, <foreign lang="greek">εἰς ὃ τὰ περιττεύοντα ὄψα</foreign> (the leavings of the dinner-table) <foreign lang="greek">εἰώθαμεν ἀποτίθεσθαι</foreign>. This was usually &lsquo;hung up&rsquo;, <foreign lang="greek">κρεμάθρα δὲ εἴρηται διὰ τὸ ἀεὶ κρεμαμένην μετέωρον εἶναι</foreign> (Suidas). Hence the use of it for Socrates in the Clouds, u. s. But it is plain that that cannot be the meaning of it here, for it does not answer to the subsequent description of it, in respect either of the resemblance or the difference stated. Rost and Palm in their Lexicon translate it &lsquo;<hi rend="italic">ankertau</hi>&rsquo;, the cable that holds the anchor; but this is open to precisely the same objection. It must be something in the nature of a hook, from which things may be <hi rend="italic">suspended;</hi> and is literally &lsquo;a suspending instrument&rsquo;. The resemblance to the anchor lies in its hooked form, and also in the intention or design of them both, which is to keep things where they are, preservation or security. The difference is that the anchor is applied to keep the vessel safe and steady <hi rend="italic">at the bottom</hi>, the hook is <hi rend="italic">above</hi>, and from it the thing suspended <hi rend="italic">hangs.</hi> Liddell and Scott have <foreign lang="greek">κρεμάστρα</foreign> (the reading of three inferior MSS) with this reference, and identify it with <foreign lang="greek">κρεμάθρα</foreign> in the Nubes. </p>
						<p>&lsquo;And the re-equalisation of cities (in the respect of property, and powers, i. e. state offices, privileges, &amp;c.) when the same principle is applied to (is the same for) things standing wide apart (very dissimilar, viz. to surface (area) and powers (functions, offices, prerogatives &amp;c.)&rsquo;. The widely dissimilar things which are here brought together for comparison, are the areas of properties, and the state offices and privileges, &amp;c., which are to be alike <hi rend="italic">equalised.</hi> The Scholiast quoted by Vater, explains the word and its application in the same way of the equalisation of the properties, fortunes or conditions, duties and rights of the citizens of a state. Victorius quotes Isocr. Phil. &sect; 40, <foreign lang="greek">οἶδα γὰρ ἁπάσας ὡμαλισμένας ὑπὸ τῶν</foreign> <pb n="130"/> <foreign lang="greek">συμφορῶν</foreign>, all the Greek cities have been alike levelled to one condition by their misfortunes. </p>
						<p>Vahlen has again applied his perverted ingenuity to the emendation of this passage. The passage wants none: it is clear in sense and construction, and the reading of the text is retained by Bekker and Spengel. In the first place, <foreign lang="greek">αν</foreign> in the compound verb is not <emph><foreign lang="greek">α</foreign></emph> privative with <emph><foreign lang="greek">ν</foreign></emph> inserted, as <foreign lang="greek">ἀνώνυμος, ἀνώδυνος</foreign>, &amp;c., but <foreign lang="greek">ἀνά</foreign> is <hi rend="italic">re</hi>, of <hi rend="italic">breaking up</hi> (<foreign lang="greek">ἀναλύειν</foreign>, &amp;c.) for redistribution, restoring to an original equality: so <foreign lang="greek">ἀναδιδόναι</foreign> &lsquo;to distribute&rsquo; (<foreign lang="greek">ψήφους</foreign>), <foreign lang="greek">ἀναδάσασθαι</foreign> &lsquo;to redistribute&rsquo; Thuc. V 4, <foreign lang="greek">ἀνάδαστος, ἀναδασμός</foreign>, <hi rend="italic">de agro ex integro aequis partibus dividendo</hi> (Herod., Plat., see Ruhnken's Timaeus p. 33), <foreign lang="greek">ἀνανέμειν</foreign>, et sim. <foreign lang="greek">ἀνωμαλίσθαι</foreign> therefore does not denote <hi rend="italic">in</hi>equality, but <hi rend="italic">re</hi>-equalisation. What the signification of the word is, appears from two passages of the Polit. II 7, 1266 <hi rend="italic">b</hi> 3 and c. 12, 1274 <hi rend="italic">b</hi> 9. In the first of these the word is <foreign lang="greek">ὁμαλισθῆναι</foreign>, in the second, <foreign lang="greek">ἀνομάλωσις</foreign>, from verbs in <foreign lang="greek">-ίζειν</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">-οῦν</foreign> respectively. They both refer to the same thing, viz. Phaleas of Chalcedon's scheme for the equalisation or re-equalisation of properties, and plainly, except perhaps so far as the <foreign lang="greek">ἀνά</foreign> is concerned, have precisely the same signification: and this is perfectly applicable here. Vahlen proposes <foreign lang="greek">καὶ ὁμαλισθῆναι τὰς πόλεις ἐν πολὺ διέχουσι ταὐτό</foreign>. His objection to <foreign lang="greek">ἀνωμαλίσθαι</foreign> seems to me to be entirely unfounded, and I can see no reason whatever for altering the text. There is another slight alteration proposed, which is not worth mentioning. </p>
						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ἐπιφάνεια</lemma> is a surface, here area; and in Euclid, a plane figure, which has only length and breadth, a superficies. </p>

						<p>This introduces a new topic of <foreign lang="greek">ἀστεῖα</foreign>, things pointed and lively, in the sense of witticisms, things amusing and laughable, such as jokes <foreign lang="greek">παρ’  ὑπόνοιαν</foreign>, or <foreign lang="greek">παρὰ προσδοκίαν</foreign>, repartees, puns, plays upon words, and the like. </p>
						<p>&lsquo;Though it is true in general that most of these &lsquo;vivacities&rsquo; are conveyed by (<foreign lang="greek">διά</foreign>) metaphor, yet they are also derived from (a temporary, momentary) delusion (leading to a pleasing <hi rend="italic">surprise</hi> at the unexpected supplement): for it becomes clearer (to the listener) that he has learnt something from (the conclusion of the sentence) being contrary&rsquo; to his expectation&mdash;or, as Victorius, from <hi rend="italic">his own</hi> contrary, i.e. changed, state of mind, which has arisen between the beginning and end of the sentence&mdash;&lsquo;and the soul seems to say to herself, &ldquo;Really, <hi rend="italic">so</hi> it is; and I missed it (never found it out till now)&rdquo;&rsquo;. (This explanation of the pleasure derived from the <hi rend="italic">unexpected</hi> surprise,&mdash;that the previous deception heightens the pleasure of the acquired knowledge&mdash;is due, I think, rather to the theory which had become habitual with Ar., that all intellectual pleasure is due to the natural desire of learning, than to <pb n="131"/> his sober judgment exercised upon this particular application of it.) Schrader has supplied two capital instances of this form of pleasantry: the first is from Cic. de Or. II 281, <hi rend="italic">Quid huic abest&mdash;nisi res et virtus?</hi> Here the listener is <hi rend="italic">misled</hi> by the opening of the sentence to expect a very good character of somebody, when unexpectedly, after a pause, two words are added as exceptions, which convert the expected eulogium into beggary and worthlessness: but is it the <hi rend="italic">learning</hi>, the becoming acquainted with that fact, however unexpectedly, that constitutes the pleasure or amusement that the listener derives from his surprise? A still better from Quint. of a dandy advocate, <hi rend="italic">illud Afri</hi> &ldquo;<hi rend="italic">homo in agendis causis optime&mdash; vestitus</hi>,&rdquo; for the expected <hi rend="italic">versatus</hi><note anchored="yes">What is learnt here is only that the man whom you expected (at the beginning of the sentence) to be an accomplished lawyer, turns out to be an empty coxcomb. It may be doubted again whether the knowledge of <hi rend="italic">that</hi> fact would give much pleasure.</note>, Quint. VI 3. 24 and 84. This topic he calls, <hi rend="italic">decipiendi opinionem.</hi> He returns to it again in VIII 5. 15 under the name of <hi rend="italic">ex inopinato:</hi> and gives two examples. Cic. de Or. II 63. 255; 70. 284, <hi rend="italic">iocus praeter expectationem.</hi> I have quoted two or three English ones in the note to Introd. p. 319, note 3. </p>
						<p>&lsquo;And the apophthegms that have point and vivacity derive this character from the <hi rend="italic">indirect</hi> statement of the meaning (from the speaker's not directly expressing the intended meaning), as that of Stesichorus &ldquo;that their cicalas will have to sing to themselves from the ground&rdquo;&rsquo; all the trees being cut down and the land devastated; which is the real, direct, meaning: and <foreign lang="greek">ἑαυτοῖς</foreign>, that there will be no one else to listen to them. On <foreign lang="greek">ἀποφθέγματα</foreign>, see II 21. 8, where this is also quoted, Stesichorus' apophthegm also appears in Demetr. <foreign lang="greek">π. ἑρμ.</foreign> &sect; 99 where it is attributed to Dionysius (the tyrant; as a threat); and &sect; 243, as an example of <foreign lang="greek">βραχυλογία</foreign> in the chapter on <foreign lang="greek">δεινότης</foreign>. This is a <hi rend="italic">riddle</hi> in the shape of an apophthegm: the next topic brings us to aenigmas proper. The pleasure derived from these is traced, as usual, to that of learning: and against that explanation in the <hi rend="italic">present</hi> instance I have no objection to make. </p>
						<p>&lsquo;And for the same reason, riddles well wrapped up give pleasure: for not only is this (viz. the solution of them) a kind of <hi rend="italic">learning</hi>, but they are also expressed in metaphor. And what Theodorus calls &ldquo;novel phrases, expressions.&rdquo; This is effected (this <hi rend="italic">novelty</hi>, this <hi rend="italic">surprise</hi>) when (the sequel) is unexpected, and not, to use his own words, &ldquo;according to previous opinion or expectation&rdquo;; but, as is the custom of humorous, <pb n="132"/> jocular writers, who alter the letters of words to make jokes&rsquo;. I have given a free transl. of the last clause; with <foreign lang="greek">οἱ ἐν τοῖς γελοίοις</foreign> understand <foreign lang="greek">ὄντες</foreign> or <foreign lang="greek">διατρίβοντες</foreign>; and with <foreign lang="greek">τὰ παραπεποιημένα, ποιοῦσιν</foreign>, or the like. </p>

						<p>&lsquo;Which is the effect also of <hi rend="italic">literal</hi> jokes (founded upon the letters and the changes of them); for these also cheat (the expectation, and so far mislead). (This kind of joke is not confined to prose: it appears) also in verses.

Gr.</hi> II 453, Spengel) in a chap. <foreign lang="greek">περὶ τοῦ κωμικῶς λέγειν</foreign>, has illustrated this topic, which he calls <foreign lang="greek">παρῳδία</foreign>, by the same verse of Aristoph.; and also this and <foreign lang="greek">τὸ παρὰ προσδοκίαν</foreign> from Dem. de Cor. </p>
						<p>&lsquo;Pleasantries arising from changes of letters (plays on words) are produced, not by a mere enunciation of a word in its direct meaning, but by something (a change) which gives a different <hi rend="italic">turn</hi> to it, (converts or twists it into a different sense); as that of Theodorus (of Byzantium, the rhetorician: <hi rend="italic">supra</hi>, II 23. 28), against Nicon the harper, <foreign lang="greek">θράττει</foreign>: he pretends namely to say &ldquo;it confounds you&rdquo; (you are confounded), and cheats; for he means something else: and therefore it is amusing only after one has become acquainted with the meaning (or circumstances); <pb n="133"/> for if (the hearer) doesn't know that he is a Thracian, he will see no point in it at all&rsquo;. Victorius and Schrader have both missed the meaning of this pun. But in order to arrive at it, we must first remove from the text the first <foreign lang="greek">σε</foreign> after <foreign lang="greek">θράττει</foreign> which has been introduced from the second (where it is required) and spoils the pun. Nicon, it appears from the explanation, is, or is supposed to be, of foreign extraction; and not only that, but a Thracian, the most barbarous of all nations. The Thracian women were habitually slaves, in Athenian families: Arist. Thesm. 279, 280, 284, 293, Pac. 1138, Vesp. 828. This person is addressed by Theodorus with the word <foreign lang="greek">θράττει</foreign>, which means <hi rend="italic">apparently</hi>, &lsquo;You are confounded&rdquo;; this appears from the interpretation that follows, (<foreign lang="greek">τι</foreign>) <foreign lang="greek">θράττει σε</foreign>, which is of course convertible in meaning with the passive <foreign lang="greek">θράττει</foreign> (and it follows also that the first <foreign lang="greek">σε</foreign> must be an error of the transcriber, for <foreign lang="greek">θράττει σε</foreign> would be no interpretation of <foreign lang="greek">θράττει σε</foreign>; nor in that form would there be any pun). It <hi rend="italic">really</hi> means, however, <foreign lang="greek">Θρᾶττ’  εἶ</foreign>, &ldquo;You are a Thracian maid-servant&rdquo;, not only an out-and-out barbarian, but effeminate to boot, and a menial. Schrader's explanation is &ldquo;<foreign lang="greek">Θράττη</foreign> (<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>) <foreign lang="greek">σε</foreign>, hoc est, <hi rend="italic">Thracia mulier te</hi>, intellige <hi rend="italic">peperit:</hi>&rdquo; at once impossible in respect of the Greek, and pointless. Victorius, to much the same effect. </p>
						<p>The amusement derived from a pun is thus explained by Cicero, de Or. II 62. 254, <hi rend="italic">Ambiguum</hi> (double-entendre) <hi rend="italic">per se ipsum probatur id quidem, ut ante dixi, vel maxime; ingeniosi enim videtur vim verbi in aliud atque ceteri accipiant posse ducere; sed admirationem magis quam risum movet, nisi si quando incidit in aliud genus ridiculi.</hi> </p>
						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">βούλει αὐτὸν πέρσαι</lemma>] No satisfactory explanation has hitherto been given of this pun. The point of the joke has been always supposed to lie in <foreign lang="greek">πέρσαι</foreign>. Franc&eacute;sco dei Medici, a friend of Vettori, suggested to him a solution which he quotes at length, that the Persae a poem of Timotheus is referred to, and that we should read <foreign lang="greek">Πέρσαις</foreign>. But as Buhle justly remarks, &ldquo;non video quidnam in hoc sit <hi rend="italic">faceti.</hi>&rdquo; Majoragius' explanation, who supposes that there was a verb <foreign lang="greek">Πέρσειν</foreign>, of the same meaning as <foreign lang="greek">Μηδίζειν</foreign>, <hi rend="italic">Persis favere</hi>, is equally out of the question. I have looked (for once) into Spengel's commentary, and find that he has suggested an analogy with Horace's <hi rend="italic">vin tu curtis Iudaeis oppedere</hi>, Sat. I 9.70. The same thought once occurred to me, but I abandoned it, in consideration of the <hi rend="italic">form</hi> of the word, <foreign lang="greek">πέρσαι</foreign>; which, though a possible aorist, is entirely without authority. <foreign lang="greek">πέρδομαι</foreign> is a dep. and has <foreign lang="greek">παρδήσομαι</foreign> for its future, <foreign lang="greek">ἔπαρδον</foreign> for the aorist. The solution I have finally arrived at is that the alteration of letters which makes the pun, resides in <foreign lang="greek">βούλει</foreign>. This would probably be pronounced nearly, if not quite, like <foreign lang="greek">βουλή</foreign>, and the word could be rendered &lsquo;will you?&rsquo; or &lsquo;the Council&rsquo;: in the <pb n="134"/> latter sense the words would mean &lsquo;may the council destroy him.&rsquo; <hi rend="italic">Sed de his nugis iam satis est.</hi> </p>

						<p>&lsquo;But both of them&rsquo; (either the two last examples of <foreign lang="greek">παρὰ γράμμα</foreign>; or that topic itself and the preceding, <foreign lang="greek">παρὰ προσδοκίαν</foreign>: they all require the same precaution) &lsquo;must be properly pronounced&rsquo; (or delivered&mdash;attention must be called to the <foreign lang="greek">παρὰ προσδοκίαν</foreign>, by a slight pause, and to the double-entendre by heightening the tone or some similar expedient). The following words, <foreign lang="greek">οὕτω δὲ καὶ τὰ ἀστεῖα</foreign>, sadly want the end of the sentence to enable us to determine their meaning. Victorius understands it, &ldquo;tanquam in <foreign lang="greek">σκώμμασιν</foreign> et iocis amarioribus, ita in urbanis hisce sermonibus&rdquo;: but Ar. makes no such distinction: all the jokes <foreign lang="greek">παρὰ γράμμα</foreign> are alike <foreign lang="greek">ἀστεῖα</foreign>. Vater fills it up thus; <foreign lang="greek">οὕτω δὲ καὶ</foreign> (<foreign lang="greek">ταὐτὸ δύναται ταῦτα</foreign>) <foreign lang="greek">τὰ ἀστεῖα</foreign> (<foreign lang="greek">διὰ ὁμωνυμίας</foreign>): <foreign lang="greek">ταῦτα</foreign> being the before-mentioned <foreign lang="greek">ἀμφότερα</foreign>; so that this is to be referred to the <foreign lang="greek">ὁμωνυμία</foreign> which follows, and begins a new topic: a most unnatural interpretation as it seems to me. In default of any thing better I propose the following:&mdash; </p>
						<p>&lsquo;And so likewise witticisms, pointed sayings <hi rend="italic">in general</hi> (as distinguished from the two special varieties, or two particular instances preceding), (require the same attention to <hi rend="italic">pronunciation</hi>), as to say that &ldquo;to the Athenians the <hi rend="italic">command</hi> of the sea was not the <hi rend="italic">beginning</hi> (both expressed by the same word, <foreign lang="greek">ἀρχήν</foreign>) of their misfortunes&rdquo;; for they derived benefit from it&rsquo; (it was the <hi rend="italic">source</hi> not of evil, but of good). Or, as Isocrates puts it, that &ldquo;the command was to the city the beginning (or source) of her calamities.&rdquo; This, or something like it, occurs three times in Isocrates. The two similar places, one a mere repetition of the other, Phil. &sect; 61, and de Pace &sect; 101, are probably what Ar. had (very imperfectly) in his recollection: the third is, Paneg. &sect; 119, which differs more widely from the quotation. </p>
						<p>&lsquo;For in both (these cases, or examples) that is said which one would not suppose likely to be said by any one, (<hi rend="italic">lit.</hi> which one would not suppose that any one, <foreign lang="greek">τινά</foreign>, would say) and (yet, at the same time) is recognised as true (sound, in accordance with facts, Victorius, see III 7.9, <hi rend="italic">infra</hi> &sect; 10): for though it is true that there is nothing particularly clever in calling the <hi rend="italic">command</hi> a <hi rend="italic">beginning</hi>, (in calling <foreign lang="greek">ἀρχὴ ἀρχή</foreign>, though in different senses), still he uses the term not in the same, but in different senses, (in the <hi rend="italic">second</hi> example, Vahlen), and does not contradict (or deny) the use of <foreign lang="greek">ἀρχή</foreign> (in the <hi rend="italic">first</hi> example), only in a different sense&rsquo;. The second example, from Isocrates, may seem at first sight to <pb n="135"/> contradict the first, what is affirmed in the one being denied in the other. But if allowance be made for the double sense of <foreign lang="greek">ἀρχή</foreign>, the apparent discrepancy between the two statements will disappear. </p>
					</div3>
					<div3 id="b3c11s8" type="section" n="8">
						<p>&lsquo;But in all these cases, the merit (<foreign lang="greek">τὸ εὖ</foreign>) consists in the proper application of the term (i. e. the <hi rend="italic">appropriateness</hi> of it to the thing described), whether by (expressed in) ambiguity (the play on words) or metaphor&rsquo;. <foreign lang="greek">ἐνέγκῃ</foreign>, sc. <foreign lang="greek">ὁ λέγων</foreign>: and comp. III 4. 2, <foreign lang="greek">οἰστέαι...αἱ μεταφοραί</foreign>. </p>
						<p>&lsquo;For instance &ldquo;Intolerable Tolerable&rdquo;&mdash;the contradiction lies only in the ambiguity; but this is appropriate if the owner of the name is a bore (or naisance)&rsquo;. Read with Bekker and Spengel <foreign lang="greek">Ἀνάσχετος οὐκ ἀνάσχετος</foreign> [not <foreign lang="greek">ἄσχετος</foreign>, with Bekker's Oxford ed. of 1837]. The first is a proper name; as &lsquo;Tolerable&rsquo; must be supposed to be in the English version. <foreign lang="greek">ὁμωνυμίαν ἀπέφησεν</foreign> &lsquo;the speaker contradicts the ambiguous <hi rend="italic">word</hi> only&rsquo;; not the <hi rend="italic">thing</hi> itself: the application, not the fact. These contradictory, or privative, epithets of proper names&mdash;comp. the privative epithets of metaphors, III 6. 7 and note&mdash;may be exemplified in our own language by <hi rend="italic">ruthless Ruth, helpless Helps, fearless Phear, inconstant Constance, unpleasant Pleasance, ignoble Noble, Hotspur cold-spur</hi>, and the like. Significant Greek names are to be found in II 23. 29, III 15. 8; Latin in Quint. VI 3. 55. Others are <foreign lang="greek">Ἄνεκτος</foreign> (which is precisely parallel to <foreign lang="greek">Ἀνάσχετος</foreign> in our text) and <foreign lang="greek">Νικήτης</foreign>, Eustath. ad Hom. Il. A p. 156&mdash;but in fact most Greek proper names are significant in themselves, though they may have lost the appropriateness of their personal application. </p>
						<p>&lsquo;And, &ldquo;never make thyself as a stranger, more of a stranger than is required of thee&rdquo;, &ldquo;not more than thou art bound to do&rdquo;; the same thing (in different words)&rsquo;. As the words are <hi rend="italic">not</hi> different, but the same, Vahlen<note anchored="yes">Vahlen, in <hi rend="italic">Trans. Vien. Acad.</hi>, u. s. pp. 146, 7. He also would connect the sentence thus, which is a more doubtful improvement, <foreign lang="greek">ἢ οὐ μᾶλλον ἤσε δεῖ. τὸ αὐτὸ καὶ οὐ· δεῖ κ.τ.λ.</foreign></note> very reasonably proposes to omit <foreign lang="greek">σε δεῖ</foreign> in the Iambic verse, <foreign lang="greek">οὐκ ἂν γένοιο μᾶλλον ἢ ξένος ξένος</foreign> &lsquo;more strange than a stranger&rsquo;; so that <foreign lang="greek">οὐ μᾶλλον ἤ σε δεῖ</foreign> is now differently expressed, and becomes what it is said to be, an explanation; or the expression of the same thing in different words. Victorius thinks that one of the two may mean &lsquo;host&rsquo; or &lsquo;guest&rsquo;; but as <foreign lang="greek">ξένος</foreign> is not repeated in the alternative, Vahlen's explanation seems more probable. &lsquo;And, (in a third way) &ldquo;a stranger must not be always a stranger&rdquo; (or, strange): for that too is again of <pb n="136"/> a different kind, or form&rsquo;, (foreign, alien, to the two others: <foreign lang="greek">ἀλλότριον</foreign> belonging to something or somebody else; opposed to <foreign lang="greek">οἰκεῖον</foreign>). </p>
						<p>&lsquo;Of the same kind is also that so highly praised verse of Anaxandrides, &ldquo;A noble thing it is to die ere doing aught worthy of death&rdquo;: for this is the same as saying, &ldquo;It is worthy to die when one is not worthy to die&rdquo;, or &ldquo;it is a worthy thing to die when one does not deserve death&rdquo;, or &ldquo;doing nothing worthy of death&rdquo;&rsquo;.

						<p>&lsquo;Similes too, as has been already said in the preceding (chapter, c. 4), are always in a certain sense popular metaphors. For they are always composed of (or, expressed in) two terms, just like the proportional metaphor; as for instance, the shield, we say, is Ares' goblet&rsquo;, (the shape of the <foreign lang="greek">φιάλη</foreign> is in reality more like an elongated saucer, or shield&mdash; whence the comparison), &lsquo;and a bow a stringless harp. When thus expressed, the phrase is not single (or simple; it has <hi rend="italic">both</hi> terms expressed, the two terms viz. that are brought into comparison; and is therefore a simile); whereas to call the bow a harp or the shield a goblet is single&rsquo; (and therefore only a metaphor). [<foreign lang="greek">ἀεὶ εὐδοκιμοῦσαι</foreign>. &ldquo;<hi rend="italic">in</hi> <foreign lang="greek">ἀεὶ</foreign> <hi rend="italic">fortasse latet</hi> <foreign lang="greek">αἱ</foreign>.&rdquo; Spengel.] </p>
						<p>The meaning seems to be this. The difference between a simile and a metaphor is&mdash;besides the greater detail of the former, the simile being a metaphor <hi rend="italic">writ large</hi>&mdash;that it always <hi rend="italic">distinctly expresses</hi> the two terms that are compared, bringing them into <hi rend="italic">apparent</hi> contrast: the metaphor on the other hand, <hi rend="italic">substituting</hi> by <hi rend="italic">transfer</hi> the one notion for the other of the two compared, identifies them as it were in one image, and expresses both in <hi rend="italic">a single</hi> word, leaving the comparison between <pb n="138"/> the object illustrated, and the analogous notion which throws a new light upon it, to suggest itself from the manifest correspondence to the hearer. </p>
						<p>On the <foreign lang="greek">φιάλη Ἄρεος</foreign>, see note on III 4.4, and Introd. pp. 220&mdash;292, there referred to. This was due to Timotheus the dithyrambic poet. The <foreign lang="greek">φόρμιγξ ἄχορδος</foreign> for <foreign lang="greek">τόξον</foreign>&mdash;the point of resemblance which brings the two together seems to be the common twang of the bowstring and harp-string produced in each case by the vibration of the string. The bow may therefore be called a stringless harp, as wanting the <hi rend="italic">many</hi> strings of the musical instrument, or, in other words, an unmusical harp. On these privative epithets with metaphors, comp. III 6.7. The author of this last bit of <foreign lang="greek">ἀστειότης</foreign> is a tragic poet named Theognis, mentioned with contempt and ridicule three times by Aristophanes, Acharn. 11, and 138, and Thesm. 168. He is said to have received the nickname of <foreign lang="greek">χιών</foreign> from his excessive <foreign lang="greek">ψυχρότης</foreign>. Of all his writings only this one phrase has survived, preserved by Demetrius, <foreign lang="greek">π. ἑρμηνείας, π. μεταφορᾶς</foreign>, &sect; 85.

If the Thrasymachus who made the remark upon him be&mdash;as he doubtless is&mdash;the famous Sophist, this must be the Niceratus who is here meant. The second, mentioned in Dem. c. Mid. &sect; 165, and afterwards in a list of witnesses with the name of his deme <foreign lang="greek">Ἀχερδούσιος</foreign>, &sect; 168, was probably the grandson of the other; for the names of Nicias and Niceratus seem to have alternated in successive generations in this family, as they did in that of Callias and Hipponicus.

For the black eye<note anchored="yes"><foreign lang="greek">τὸ ὑπώπιον</foreign>, which stands here for &lsquo;a black eye&rsquo;, is originally nothing but the seat of that, the part that is under the eye. It is thence transferred to the signification of the discoloured surface that results from a blow under the eye (<foreign lang="greek">ὑπωπιασμός</foreign>)&mdash;the special for the general&mdash;<foreign lang="greek">ὑπωπιάζειν</foreign> being to &lsquo;strike, or inflict a blow under the eye&rsquo;, and <foreign lang="greek">ὑπωπιασμένον</foreign> here &lsquo;one so struck&rsquo;, including the resulting discolouration. See for exemplifications of all three, Arist. Pax 541, Acharn. 551, Vesp. 1386. Fragm. Apolloph. 1. Vol. 11 880, Meineke, <hi rend="italic">Fr. Com.

Victorius). According to Theophrastus, de Caus. Plant. VI 6. 4, there are two kinds of mulberries, red and white, <foreign lang="greek">ἐρυθρὸν καὶ λευκόν</foreign>. This is an instance of Quintilian's <hi rend="italic">first</hi> variety of hyperbole; <hi rend="italic">quum plus facto dicimus, direct</hi> exaggeration; of which two examples are given. Victorius refers to the saying of an Athenian wag about Sulla, <foreign lang="greek">συκάμινόν ἐσθ’  ὁ Σύλλας ἀλφίτῳ πεπασμένον</foreign>, &ldquo;Sulla (i. e. his face) is like a mulberry powdered with flour&rdquo;, in Plutarch [<hi rend="italic">Sulla</hi>, c. 2, p. 451 F]. </p>
						<p>&lsquo;And another (kind of phrase) like so and so&rsquo; (comp. <foreign lang="greek">τὰ καὶ τά</foreign>, <hi rend="italic">infra</hi> c. 17. 11; this seems to mean the two preceding examples, which are here repeated, <hi rend="italic">and others like them</hi>) &lsquo;is a hyperbole, differing from it merely by the form of the expression (it becomes a hyperbole by dropping the particle of comparison, <foreign lang="greek">ὥσπερ</foreign>). Thus &ldquo;like Philammon at close quarters with the sack&rdquo;, (may be thrown into the form of a hyperbole, thus), &ldquo;you would have taken him for Philammon fighting the sack&rdquo;. Again, &ldquo;to wear his legs curly like parsley&rdquo;, becomes &ldquo;you'ld have thought his legs not legs, but parsley, so crooked are they&rdquo;&rsquo;. This is Quintilian's <hi rend="italic">second</hi> variety of hyperbole, u. s. &sect; 68, <hi rend="italic">superiectio per similitudinem, aut per comparationem:</hi> illustrated by <hi rend="italic">Credas innare revulsas Cycladas</hi>, Virg.

						<p>&lsquo;The hyperbole has a <hi rend="italic">juvenile</hi> character, signifying vehemence: and therefore they are most used by people when they are angry; &ldquo;No, not if he were to offer me gifts as the sand or dust for multitude&rdquo; (or gifts in number like the sand or dust). &ldquo;And the daughter of Agamemnon <pb n="143"/> son of Atreus will I <hi rend="italic">not</hi> wed, no, not though she vied in beauty with golden Aphrodite, and in accomplishments [deftness of handiwork] with Athene&rdquo;&rsquo;, comp.

It is used by Plato [Rep. 466 B, and 498 B] in the sense of &lsquo;puerile&rsquo;. The latter usually represents this by <foreign lang="greek">νεανικός</foreign>, which he uses in two opposite senses, of the good and bad qualities of youth; either gallant, spirited, generous, noble, splendid and such like, or rash, wanton, insolent: also <foreign lang="greek">νεανίας</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">νεανιεύεσθαι</foreign>. </p>
						<p>&lsquo;This figure is an especial favourite with the Attic orators&rsquo;. </p>
						<p>&lsquo;And this is why the use of it is unbecoming to an elderly man&rsquo;&mdash; not because, as might be supposed from the arrangement of the sentences, it was such a favourite with the Attic orators but&mdash;because it is a <hi rend="italic">juvenile</hi> trait of character, and as such must be inappropriate to the <hi rend="italic">opposite.</hi> </p>
						<p>[It may be doubted whether the awkward remark, <foreign lang="greek">χρῶνται δὲ μάλιστα τούτῳ οἱ Ἀττικοὶ ῥήτορες</foreign>, which is a parenthetical note immediately succeeding another parenthesis and breaking the connexion between the beginning and the end of the section, was really written by Aristotle at all.

					<p>We now return for the last time to the subject of propriety of style, on which in this chapter we have some concluding observations. Rhetorical propriety must shew itself in the due adaptation of style to matter; and consequently the three branches of Rhetoric must be treated each in its appropriate style. We therefore distinguish two kinds of speeches, and two styles appropriate to them; (1) &lsquo;debate&rsquo;, speaking in the actual strife or contest of the assembly and the law-court, <foreign lang="greek">ἀγω-</foreign> <pb n="144"/> <foreign lang="greek">νιστικὴ λέξις</foreign>, and (2) <foreign lang="greek">γραφική</foreign>, written compositions, which are confined to the third or epideictic branch: and the first is again subdivided into (<hi rend="italic">a</hi>) public speaking, popular harangues addressed to the assembly, and (<hi rend="italic">b</hi>) forensic. This is only true in theory: in practice speeches were often written by the orators, as Demosthenes and Isocrates, for the use of those who were incompetent or unwilling to write and plead for themselves. </p>
					<p>Under the head of <foreign lang="greek">γραφικὴ λέξις</foreign> are included all compositions which are intended to be read, and consequently the whole range of literature, with the exception of speeches which are intended to be <hi rend="italic">delivered</hi> or <hi rend="italic">acted</hi>, deliberative and forensic, <hi rend="italic">public</hi> and <hi rend="italic">private</hi> orations&mdash;such as those of Demosthenes. Thus the third branch of Rhetoric, the <foreign lang="greek">ἐπιδεικτική</foreign>, is made to embrace all poetry, philosophy, history, and indeed any <hi rend="italic">writing</hi> on any subject whatsoever. The distinction coincides with that of Hermogenes, <foreign lang="greek">περὶ ἰδεῶν τομ. β́. περὶ τοῦ πολιτικοῦ λόγου</foreign> (see <hi rend="italic">Rhet. Gr.</hi> II. p. 401 seq. Spengel), who divides composition into <foreign lang="greek">λόγοι συμβουλευτικοί, δικανικοί</foreign>, and <foreign lang="greek">πανηγυρικοί</foreign>, the last including the works of Homer and Plato, the most distinguished of poets and prose writers. </p>
					<p>The declamations delivered at the Olympian Games and other great public festivals or assemblies <foreign lang="greek">πανυγύρεις</foreign>, whence the name <foreign lang="greek">πανηγυρικοὶ λόγοι</foreign>&mdash;such as Isocrates' Panegyric<note anchored="yes">See on this, Mr Sandys' Introduction to <hi rend="italic">Isocratis Panegyricus</hi>, p. XL seq.</note> and Panathenaic orations, and Lysias' celebrated <foreign lang="greek">Ὀλυμπιακός</foreign>, of which a short fragment is preserved, (Or. 33, Baiter et Sauppe, <hi rend="italic">Or. Att.</hi> I 146)&mdash;were intermediate between the public or agonistic and the epideictic or graphic speeches, partaking of the character of both; being declaimed in public and sometimes with a political object (as Lysias' speech, and some of Isocrates'), but that object was subordinate, the main consideration being always the display. Isocrates is always anxious to impress his readers with the conviction that his speeches are not mere empty declamations, <foreign lang="greek">ἐπιδείξεις</foreign>, but genuine <foreign lang="greek">πολιτικοὶ λόγοι</foreign>&mdash;are indeed a branch of Philosophy, which with him is pretty nearly convertible with Rhetoric, see <foreign lang="greek">κατὰ τῶν σοφιστῶν</foreign> &sect;&sect; 1, 11, 21, and Mr Sandys' note on Paneg. &sect; 10. [&lsquo;Isocrates means by &ldquo;Philosophy&rdquo; a combination of the accomplishments of the <foreign lang="greek">ῥήτωρ</foreign> and the <foreign lang="greek">πολιτικός</foreign>&rsquo;. Thompson's <hi rend="italic">Phaedrus</hi>, p. 172.] </p>
					<p>Isocrates, writing from his point of view, <foreign lang="greek">ἀντίδ</foreign>. &sect;&sect; 46&mdash;50, contrasts himself and his own declamations, which he calls <foreign lang="greek">Ἑλληνικοὺς καὶ πολιτικοὺς καὶ πανηγυρικούς</foreign>, with <foreign lang="greek">δικανικοὶ λόγοι</foreign>, forensic pleading and pleaders, whom, probably in consequence of his own failure in that branch of Rhetoric, he attacks and vituperates upon intellectual, social, and moral grounds. Writing before the establishment of Aristotle's threefold division of the art, he evidently recognises only two branches, public or political speaking, in which national interests are concerned&mdash; and at the head of these he places his own <foreign lang="greek">πανηγυρικοὶ λόγοι</foreign>, the true philosophy (&sect; 50)&mdash;and judicial or forensic, in which private interests <pb n="145"/> between man and man are debated and decided. In respect of style, he of course gives the preference to his own kind of composition, &sect;&sect; 46, 7. </p>
					<p>On this adaptation of style to the different kinds of oratory, see Quint. VIII 3. 11&mdash;14. The opening observation, at all events, looks like a reference to this chapter, though Spalding in his note is silent on the subject. </p>
					<p>Whately also, in his <hi rend="italic">Rhet.</hi> c. IV &lsquo;on Elocution&rsquo;, (<hi rend="italic">Encycl. Metrop.</hi> p. 299 <hi rend="italic">b</hi>, 300 <hi rend="italic">a</hi>, 301 <hi rend="italic">b</hi>,) has some good observations, partly derived from Aristotle, upon the contrast of the <hi rend="italic">agonistic</hi> and <hi rend="italic">graphic</hi> styles. On the contrast of the two, see by all means Isocr. Phil. &sect;&sect; 25, 26: all the main points of interest in public and forensic, or agonistic, speeches are there enumerated, and the comparatively lifeless speeches <hi rend="italic">to be read</hi>, forcibly contrasted with them. [Comp. also Alcidamas, <foreign lang="greek">περὶ τῶν τοὺς γραπτοὺς λόγους γραφόντων</foreign>, (against Isocrates).] </p>
					<div3 id="b3c12s1" type="section" n="1">
						<p>&lsquo;It must not be forgotten (lost sight of) that a different kind of language is appropriate to each different kind (of Rhetoric). For the same style is not suitable to <hi rend="italic">written</hi> composition (that which is intended <hi rend="italic">to be read</hi>) and that which is used in <hi rend="italic">debate</hi> (in the <hi rend="italic">contests</hi>, the actual struggle, of real life; nor again in (the two divisions of the latter) public and forensic speaking. The orator must be acquainted with both: for the one (debate) implies the knowledge and power of clear expression in pure Greek, and the other freedom from the necessity (<hi rend="italic">lit.</hi> the not being obliged to) of suppressing in silence (<foreign lang="greek">κατά</foreign>, keeping <hi rend="italic">down</hi>) anything that one may want to communicate to the rest of the world; which is the case with those who have no knowledge (or skill) of writing (i.e. composition)&rsquo;. Comp. III 1. 7. Cicero, de Or. II 82. 337, gives a brief description of the &lsquo;grand&rsquo; and dignified style appropriate to the exalted subjects of public speaking. </p>
						<p>The meaning of this seems to be&mdash;the orator must be acquainted with the written as well as the debating style; the latter implies and requires only the correct use of one's native language, so that one may be able to make oneself clearly intelligible: <hi rend="italic">this</hi> (debate alone) does not require the minute accuracy of studied composition, which can be examined at leisure and criticized; but since one who can only speak, and not write, is incapable of communicating his opinions to the rest of the world (<foreign lang="greek">τοῖς ἄλλοις</foreign>, all others besides the members of the assembly or law-court that he is actually addressing), it is necessary for a statesman to acquire the power of writing well, and therefore to study in some degree the art of exact composition. Victorius, who renders <foreign lang="greek">τὸ μὴ ἀναγκάζεσθαιτοῖς ἄλλοις</foreign> of actual writing, that is of <hi rend="italic">letters</hi> to absent friends, seems to narrow the meaning of &lsquo;writing&rsquo; in such a way as to produce a somewhat ridiculous result. Surely <hi rend="italic">any</hi> educated man, whether he be an orator and statesman or not, requires and possesses the knowledge of <hi rend="italic">writing</hi> in that sense. On <foreign lang="greek">τὸ μὲν γάρ ἐστιν ἑλληνίζειν ἐπίστασθαι</foreign>, Thuc. II 60, 5&mdash;6 may serve as a commentary; Pericles, in his defence, describing his qualifications for a statesman, says <foreign lang="greek">οὐδενὸς οἴομαι ἥσσων εἶναι γνῶναί τε τὰ δέοντα</foreign> <pb n="146"/> <foreign lang="greek">καὶ ἑρμηνεῦσαι ταῦτα...ὄ τε γὰρ γνοὺς καὶ μὴ σαφῶς διδάξας ἐν ἴσῳ καὶ εἰ μὴ ἐνεθυμήθη</foreign>. </p>
					</div3>
					<div3 id="b3c12s2" type="section" n="2">
						<p>&lsquo;The written style is the most exact&rsquo; (or finished: on <foreign lang="greek">ἀκρίβεια</foreign> and its various senses, see Grant ad Eth. Nic. I 7. 18, and the references in Introd. ad h. l. p. 334, note 4), &lsquo;that of debate lends itself most to acting&rsquo; (or delivery: is the &lsquo;most capable of being acted&rsquo;). Comp. III 1. 4. The reason of this as far as <hi rend="italic">declamation</hi> is concerned, viz. why the <hi rend="italic">graphic</hi> style admits of more ornament and artificial arrangement than the other, is thus stated by Cicero, Orat. LXI 208. After the invention of the period, &amp;c., he says, <hi rend="italic">nemo qui aliquo esset in numero scripsit orationem generis eius, quod esset ad delectationem comparatum remotumque a iudiciis forensique certamine, quin redigeret omnes fere in quadrum numerumque sententias. Nam quum is est auditor, qui non vereatur ne compositae orationis insidiis sua fides attemptatur, gratiam quoque habet oratori voluptati aurium servienti.</hi> </p>
						<p>&lsquo;Of this (<foreign lang="greek">ἀγωνιστική</foreign>) there are two kinds; one that (includes, conveys,) represents <hi rend="italic">character</hi>, the other <hi rend="italic">emotion</hi> (in the speech)&rsquo;. That is, not that <foreign lang="greek">ἀγωνιστική</foreign> is a <hi rend="italic">genus</hi>, containing two <hi rend="italic">species</hi> under it, moral and emotional: for this is not the fact, and also <hi rend="italic">any</hi> speech may have <hi rend="italic">both:</hi> but that these two elements belong specially, not exclusively, to the two debating branches of Rhetoric, of which they are very prominent ingredients: the reality of the interests at stake giving more room for the play of passion and the assumption of character than the cold unimpassioned, deliberate <hi rend="italic">written</hi> compositions. The ethical part is of two kinds, the <foreign lang="greek">ἦθος ἐν τῷ λέγοντι</foreign>, I 2. 4, II 1. 4, and the <hi rend="italic">characters</hi> <foreign lang="greek">ἤθη</foreign> of the several ages and conditions, II 12. 17. The emotional is of course that which is partially described I 2. 5, and treated at length in II 2. 16. Of these &lsquo;appeals to the feelings&rsquo;, <foreign lang="greek">δείνωσις</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">ἔλεος</foreign>, the earlier rhetorical treatises were full, I 1. 3, of which Thrasymachus' <foreign lang="greek">ἔλεοι</foreign> (III 1. 7) described by Plato, Phaedr. 267 C, was a well-known specimen. Quint. III 8. 12, (In concionibus deliberatio) <hi rend="italic">affectus, ut quae maxima, postulat</hi>, seq. <hi rend="italic">Valet autem in consiliis auctoritas</hi> (this is principally due to <foreign lang="greek">ἦθος</foreign>) <hi rend="italic">plurimum</hi>, seq. See III 7. 1, 3, 6, where the two are described. The <foreign lang="greek">ἦθος</foreign> is there confined to those of age, nation, station, &amp;c. Compare with all this, Demetr. <foreign lang="greek">π. ἑρμηνείας  193, ἐναγώνιος μὲν οὖν ἴσως μᾶλλον ἡ διαλελυμένη λέξις, αὕτη καὶ ὑποκριτικὴ καλεῖται· κινεῖ γὰρ ὑπόκρισιν ἡ λύσις. γραφικὴ δὲ λέξις ἡ εὐανάγνωστος. αὕτη δέ ἐστιν ἡ συνηρτημένη καὶ οἷον ἠσφαλισμένη τοῖς συνδέσμοις. διὰ τοῦτο δὲ καὶ Μένανδρον ὑποκρίνονται λελυμένον ἐν τοῖς πλείστοις, Φιλήμονα δὲ ἀναγινώσκουσιν</foreign>. </p>
						<p>&lsquo;And this is why actors also (as well as debaters) hunt after (<foreign lang="greek">διώκουσι</foreign>) plays of this kind (that is, plays of which the subjects give scope for the exhibitions of passion and character), and the poets after persons (whether <hi rend="italic">actors</hi> to represent the <foreign lang="greek">πάθη</foreign>, or characters in the dramas <hi rend="italic">to be represented with</hi> them) of the same kind. At the same time, the poets <pb n="147"/> that can be read (that write to be read as well as acted or rhapsodised) become pocket-companions, or favourites&rsquo;. </p>
						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">βαστάζεσθαι</lemma> is said of anything that is carried about in the hand or arms, fondled, cherished, fondly and familiarly treated, like a baby or pet lapdog; and hence when applied to a book naturally means one that people are fond of, and carry about with them in their pockets. There are several instances in Sophocles&mdash;see Ellendt's Lex.&mdash;that illustrate this sense of <foreign lang="greek">βαστάζεσθαι</foreign>, as Philoct. 655 of the <hi rend="italic">favourite</hi> bow and 657, (Neopt.) <foreign lang="greek">ἔστιν ὥστε...καὶ βαστάσαι με</foreign> (be allowed to <hi rend="italic">nurse</hi> it), <foreign lang="greek">προσκύσαι θ’  ὥσπερ θεόν</foreign>; Aesch.

						<p>&lsquo;And upon comparison the (speeches, <foreign lang="greek">λόγοι</foreign>) of the <hi rend="italic">writers</hi> when delivered in actual contests have a narrow, confined, contracted (i.e. poor, mean, paltry) appearance, whilst those of the orators (meaning particularly the <hi rend="italic">public</hi> speakers, in the assembly), which by their skilful delivery succeed or pass muster&rsquo; (none of this is <hi rend="italic">expressed</hi> but &lsquo;well delivered&rsquo;<note anchored="yes">[So in Introd. p. 325, after Victorius and Majoragius, but compare Mr Cope's second thoughts as given in the <hi rend="italic">note</hi> on the same page: &ldquo;<foreign lang="greek">εὖ λεχθέντες</foreign> can mean nothing but &lsquo;well spoken of&rsquo;, <foreign lang="greek">ῥήτορες</foreign> being understood.&rdquo;]</note>), &lsquo;when taken in the hands (to read) look like the work of mere bunglers or novices&rsquo;. <foreign lang="greek">στενός</foreign> is the Latin <hi rend="italic">tenuis</hi>, and the English <hi rend="italic">slight</hi> and <hi rend="italic">slender</hi>, in a contemptuous and depreciatory sense. In its primary sense of <hi rend="italic">narrow</hi> it stands in opposition, in respect of style, to the wider range, and the broader, <hi rend="italic">larger</hi>, freer, bolder, tone required by the loftier and more comprehensive subjects, and also by the larger audiences, of public speakers; the high finish and minute artifices of structure, as well as the subtler and finer shades of intonation and expression, are lost in a crowd and in the open air. So Whately, <hi rend="italic">Rhet.</hi> ch. IV (<hi rend="italic">Encycl. Metrop.</hi> p. 301 <hi rend="italic">a</hi>), describes the <hi rend="italic">agonistic</hi> style, as &ldquo;a style somewhat more blunt (than the <hi rend="italic">graphic</hi>) and homely, more simple and, apparently, unstudied in its structure, and at the same time more daringly energetic.&rdquo; <foreign lang="greek">στενοί</foreign> then <pb n="148"/> represents the comparative <hi rend="italic">narrowness</hi> or confined character of the graphic style, with its studied artificial graces, careful composition, and other such &lsquo;paltrinesses&rsquo;, &lsquo;things mean and trifling&rsquo;&mdash;a sense in which it occurs in a parallel passage of Pl. Gorg. 497 C, where <foreign lang="greek">σμικρὰ καὶ στενά</foreign> are contemptuously applied by Callicles to Socrates' dialectics. This is actually said of <hi rend="italic">Isocrates</hi>, in the passage of Dionysius, de Isocr. Iud. c. 13, by Hieronymus, the philosopher of Rhodes; <foreign lang="greek">ἀναγνῶναι μὲν ἄν τινα δυνηθῆναι τοὺς λόγους αὐτοῦ</foreign> (Isocr.) <foreign lang="greek">καλῶς, δημηγορῆσαι δὲ τήν τε φωνὴν καὶ τὸν τόνον ἐπάραντα, καὶ ἐν ταύτῃ τῇ κατασκευῇ μετὰ τῆς ἁρμοττούσης ὑποκρίσεως εἰπεῖν, οὐ παντελῶς</foreign>. </p>

Certainly not the preceding <foreign lang="greek">ἀναγνωστικοί</foreign>. </p>
						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ἰδιωτικοὶ ἐν ταῖς χερσίν</lemma>] This must have been the case with Cicero's rival, Hortensius. Quintilian [XI 3. 8], after telling us that Hortensius was, during his lifetime, first thought to be chief of all orators, secondly Cicero's rival, and thirdly second to him alone, adds, <hi rend="italic">ut appareat placuisse aliquid eo dicente quod legentes non invenimus</hi> (the same may be said of many sermons). Isocrates' Phil. &sect;&sect; 25, 26, an excellent commentary on this, is unfortunately too long to quote. </p>
						<p>&lsquo;The reason is that their appropriate place is in an actual contest or debate&rsquo; (with <foreign lang="greek">ἁρμόττει</foreign> supply, if you please, <foreign lang="greek">ταῦτα</foreign> as the nomin.&mdash;it means at all events the subject of the immediately preceding clause): &lsquo;and this also is why things (speeches) intended to be <hi rend="italic">acted</hi> or delivered (<hi rend="italic">lit.</hi> proper to be, or capable of being, <foreign lang="greek">-κός</foreign>), when the delivery is withdrawn don't produce their own proper effect (or perform their <hi rend="italic">special function</hi>, <foreign lang="greek">ἔργον</foreign>), and so appear silly: for instance <hi rend="italic">asyndeta</hi>, and the reiteration of the same word in the written, <hi rend="italic">graphic</hi> style&rsquo;&mdash;with which the agonistic divested of its acting or delivery is now (surreptitiously) associated&mdash;&lsquo;are rightly disapproved; whereas in debating the orators <hi rend="italic">do</hi> employ them, because they are proper for acting&rsquo;.

						<p>What follows is a <hi rend="italic">note</hi>, a passing observation suggested by the subject, but not immediately connected with it. &lsquo;In this repetition of the same thing, some change must be made in the mode of expression of each member of it&rsquo;: (the repetition should be made in different words, to avoid monotony. See on the interpretation of this, and the figure <foreign lang="greek">μεταβολή</foreign>, to which <foreign lang="greek">μεταβάλλειν</foreign> points, a full explanation, Introd. p. 326, and note 1:) &lsquo;which paves the way as it were for the delivery&rsquo; (on <foreign lang="greek">προοδοποιεῖ</foreign>, see note on I 1. 2). &lsquo;&ldquo;This is he that <hi rend="italic">stole</hi> from you, this is he that <hi rend="italic">cheated</hi> you, this is he that last of all attempted to <hi rend="italic">betray</hi> you&rdquo;&rsquo;. (From an unknown rhetorician; most probably not the author's own.) &lsquo;And again, as another instance, what Philemon the actor (not to be confounded with the Comic <hi rend="italic">poet</hi>) used to do in Anaxandrides' <hi rend="italic">Old men's madness</hi>, where (lit. <hi rend="italic">when</hi>, <foreign lang="greek">ὅτε</foreign>) he says (uses the words in playing his part) &ldquo;Rhadamanthys and Palamedes,&rdquo; and also, in the prologue of the <hi rend="italic">Devotees</hi>, the word <foreign lang="greek">ἐγώ</foreign>: for if such things (phrases, sentences, or words) as these be not (varied) in the delivery, they become like &ldquo;<hi rend="italic">the</hi> man that carries the beam,&rdquo; in the proverb (<foreign lang="greek">τήν</foreign>)&rsquo;, i.e. stiff and awkward, like one that has &lsquo;swallowed a poker&rsquo;, as <hi rend="italic">our</hi> proverb has it. </p>
						<p>Anaxandrides, quoted before, III 10.7. The first citation from his comedy, the <foreign lang="greek">γεροντομανία</foreign>, has the rest of the verse supplied in Athen. XIV 614 C, <foreign lang="greek">καί τοι πολύ γε πονοῦμεν. τὸν ἀσύμβολον εὗρε γελοῖα λέγειν rαδάμανθυς καὶ Παλαμήδης</foreign>. On the passage of Aristotle, which he quotes, Meineke, <hi rend="italic">Fr. Comic. Gr.</hi> III 166, has the following remark: &ldquo;Philemon autem quid fecerit in recitandis verbis P. <foreign lang="greek">καὶ Π.</foreign>, non satis apparet.&rdquo; I don't suppose the repetition to have been confined to these words; all that Aristotle means to say seems to be, when Philemon had come to that point, thereabouts, the repetition took place. &ldquo;Num forte eadem verba in pluribus deinceps versibus recitabantur et alio atque alio vocis flexu et sono ab histrione recitabantur? (This follows Victorius' interpretation of <foreign lang="greek">μεταβάλλειν</foreign>.) Ita sane videtur, neque alia alterius loci fuerit ratio, in quo identidem repetebatur pronomen <foreign lang="greek">ἐγώ</foreign>.&rdquo; At all events, these were two notorious and well-remembered <hi rend="italic">points</hi> made by Philemon in this <hi rend="italic">varied</hi> repetition in acting the character which he sustained in these two comedies. There is, or was, a similar tradition (which I heard from Dr Butler, the late Bp of Lichfield, and Master of Shrewsbury School) of the effect produced by Garrick's rendering of <hi rend="italic">Pray you undo this button:&mdash;thank you, sir</hi>,&mdash;of Lear, choking in his agony, at the point of death [V.

						<p>&lsquo;And of <hi rend="italic">asyndeta</hi> the same may be said, &ldquo;I came, I met, I implored&rdquo;&rsquo;. I have translated this upon the supposition that there is no intention of distinguishing here the aorist and imperfect: &lsquo;for (here again) delivery (i.e. intonation) must come into play, and it must not be spoken as if it were all one, with the same <hi rend="italic">character</hi> and accent&rsquo;.

						<p>A good example of <hi rend="italic">asyndeton</hi>, illustrating the rapidity and vivacity which it imparts to style, is supplied by Victorius from Demosth. c. Androt. &sect; 68, <foreign lang="greek">ὁμοῦ μετοίκους, Ἀθηναίους, δέων, ἀπάγων, βοῶν ἐν ταῖς ἐκκλησίαις, ἐπὶ τοῦ βήματος</foreign>.

						<p>The vivacity imparted to style by asyndeton and the opposite (the employment of connecting particles) is admirably explained and illustrated by Campbell, <hi rend="italic">Phil. of Rhet.</hi> Bk. III sect. 2, near the end (2nd ed. Vol. II pp. 287&mdash;293.) </p>
						<p>&lsquo;Further <hi rend="italic">asyndeta</hi> have a certain special property; that (by their aid) many things seem to be said in the same time&rsquo; (as <hi rend="italic">one</hi> thing would be, if they had been employed); &lsquo;because the connecting particle (or connexion) converts several things into one, (Harris, <hi rend="italic">Hermes</hi>, II 2, p. 240,) and therefore if it be withdrawn (extracted), plainly the contrary will take place; one will become many. Accordingly (the <hi rend="italic">asyndeton</hi>) exaggerates (or amplifies: or multiplies, increases the number)<note anchored="yes">The opposite of this, the employment of <foreign lang="greek">σύνδεσμοι</foreign>, sometimes tends to produce the same effect. Demetr. <foreign lang="greek">π. ἑρμηνείας,  54, ὡς παρ’  Ὁμήρῳ</foreign> (Il.

(I have followed Bekker, Ed. 3, <foreign lang="greek">πολλὰ δοκεῖ ὑπεριδεῖν ὅσα εἶπεν</foreign>. Spengel has, <foreign lang="greek">πολλὰ δοκεῖ</foreign>, <pb n="151"/> <foreign lang="greek">ὑπερεῖδεν ὅσα εἶπον</foreign>, which does <hi rend="italic">not</hi> agree with MS A^{c}, and is also obscure.

Illustrations of this emphatic repetition, and especially of that of the pronoun <foreign lang="greek">αὐτός</foreign>, occur in a fragm. of Aeschyl, Fragm. Inc. 266, quoted at length in Plat. Rep. II 383 B, the most forcible of them all: <foreign lang="greek">κἀγὼ</foreign> (Thetis) <foreign lang="greek">τὸ Φοίβου θεῖον ἀψευδὲς στόμα ἤλπιζον εἶναι, μαντικῇ βρύον τέχνῃ. ὁ δ̓ αὐτὸς ὑμνῶν, αὐτὸς ἐν θοίνῃ παρών, &lt;&gt;ὐτὸς τάδ̓ εἰπών, αὐτός ἐστιν ὁ κτανὼν τὸν παῖδα τὸν ἐμόν</foreign>. After this it will be unnecessary to quote inferior specimens; such as Xen. Anab. III 2. 4, Aesch.

						<p>&lsquo;For a person (or thing) of which many things are said must necessarily be often mentioned; and therefore (this is a fallacy) they think it follows (<foreign lang="greek">καί</foreign>, that it is <hi rend="italic">also</hi> true) that if the name is often repeated, there must be a great deal to say about its owner: so that by this fallacy (the poet) magnifies (Nireus) by mentioning him only once (i.e. in one place), and makes him famous though he nowhere afterwards speaks of him again&rsquo;. This is the fallacy of illicit conversion of antecedent and consequent, de Soph. El. c. 5, 167 <hi rend="italic">b</hi> 1, <foreign lang="greek">ὁ δὲ παρεπόμενον ἔλεγχος διὰ τὸ οἴεσθαι ἀντιστρέφειν τὴν ἀκολούθησιν κ.τ.λ.</foreign> and Rhet. I 7. 5.

						<p>It seems as if in the following section Aristotle had, probably unconsciously misled by the ambiguous term, used <foreign lang="greek">ἀκριβής</foreign> and its <foreign lang="greek">πτώ-</foreign> <pb n="152"/> <foreign lang="greek">σεις</foreign> in two distinct senses: exactness and high finish in <hi rend="italic">style</hi> and <hi rend="italic">reasoning.</hi> The general subject and connexion of the chapter will oblige us to refer the first clause, with its comparison of public speaking to a rough sketch in black and white, without details, and producing no effect on close inspection, to the <hi rend="italic">style</hi> of the speech&mdash;which indeed is the subject of the whole book as well as this chapter&mdash;though it may possibly include also minute details of reasoning. The same thing may be said of <foreign lang="greek">ἡ δίκη ἀκριβέστερον</foreign>: in this the style <hi rend="italic">and</hi> the argument may be minuter, exacter and more detailed in proportion to the diminished size of the audience, and the increased probability of their paying attention to such things (see note ad loc.). But when we come to the third degree, the single judge, it seems to be false and absurd to say that exactness and high finish of <hi rend="italic">style</hi> is <hi rend="italic">more</hi> suited to speeches addressed to him: no man would endeavour to attract or impose upon an <hi rend="italic">arbitrator</hi> by such artifices. The exactness in this case seems therefore to be confined to exactness of reasoning and minute detail, as of evidence and the like. A single judge&mdash;as in our own courts&mdash;would always be more patient, more inclined to listen to, and more influenced by, exact reasoning and circumstantial evidence than either of the two preceding: the mob of the assembly would not hear them, nor follow them, nor listen to them at all: the large body of dicasts would be more ready to do so: but most of all the single judge. The last clause of the section brings us back to the point from which it started, viz. differences of style, and <hi rend="italic">seems</hi> to apply this exclusively to what has been said of <foreign lang="greek">ἀκρίβεια</foreign> in forensic pleading. </p>
						<p>&lsquo;Now the style of public-speaking is exactly like scene-painting; for the greater the crowd, the more distant the point of view, and consequently&rsquo; (in these crowded assemblies; held too in the open air&mdash;which should be added in respect of the style required, though this does not <hi rend="italic">distinguish</hi> it from forensic rhetoric,) &lsquo;all exactness, minute and delicate touches, and high finish in general appear to be superfluous and for the worse (deviating from the true standard of <hi rend="italic">public</hi> speaking) in both&rsquo;. Compare with this Whately's remarks, partly borrowed from Ar., <hi rend="italic">Rhet.</hi> c. IV (<hi rend="italic">Encycl. Metrop.</hi> p. 299), on the &ldquo;<hi rend="italic">bolder</hi>, as well as less accurate, kind of language allowable and advisable in speaking to a considerable number&rdquo;: he quotes Ar.'s comparison of scene-painting, and then proceeds &ldquo;to account for these phenomena&rdquo;&mdash;which Ar. has omitted to do. His explanation is derived from the various sympathies which are especially awakened in a great crowd. </p>
						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">σκιαγραφία</lemma> is a painting in outline and <hi rend="italic">chiaroscuro</hi>, or light and shade, without colour, and intended to produce its effect only <hi rend="italic">at a distance</hi>&mdash;herein lies the analogy to public speaking&mdash;consequently rough and unfinished, because <hi rend="italic">from the distance</hi> all niceties and refinements in style and finish would be entirely thrown away (<foreign lang="greek">περίεργα</foreign>). This point is well brought out in a parallel passage of Plat. Theaet. 208 E, <foreign lang="greek">νῦν δῆτα, ὦ Θ., παντάπασί γε ἔγωγε ἐπειδὴ ἐγγὺς ὥσπερ σκιαγραφήματος γέγονα τοῦ λεγομένου, ξυνίημι οὐδὲ σμικρόν· ἕως ἀφεστήκη πόρρωθεν ἐφαίνετό μοί τι λέγεσθαι</foreign> <pb n="153"/> (Heindorf, note ad loc.): &ldquo;as long as he was at a distance he seemed to understand the meaning of what was said; on a nearer approach all the apparent clearness vanished, and it became confused and indistinct.&rdquo; In Phaedo, 69 B, <foreign lang="greek">σκιαγραφία</foreign> is a mere rough sketch or outline; a daub, without any distinct features (see Wyttenbach ad loc.). Parmen. 165 C, <foreign lang="greek">οἷον ἐσκιαγραφημένα, ἀποστάντι μὲν ἓν πάντα φαινόμενα,... προσελθόντι δὲ πολλὰ καὶ ἕτερα</foreign>. Rep. X 602 D. Ib. II 365 C, where it has the same sense as in the Phaedo. Ast ad loc. Comm. p. 410. And in several other passages of Plato. As the point of comparison here is solely the difference between the near and distant effects, I have translated it &lsquo;scene-painting&rsquo; (as also Whately) which represents this better to <hi rend="italic">us:</hi> the proper and literal meaning of the word is &ldquo;the outline of a shadow&rdquo;, the supposed origin of painting. See further in Mr Wornum's art. on &lsquo;painting&rsquo;, in <hi rend="italic">Dict. Ant.</hi> p. 680 <hi rend="italic">b.</hi> With <foreign lang="greek">πορρωτέρω ἡ θέα</foreign>, comp. de Soph.

Also they are not personally interested in the dispute, and can afford to bestow more attention upon <hi rend="italic">minutiae</hi> of style, action, intonation, and such like, and being comparatively unoccupied are more likely to notice and criticize such things. All these are reasons why <foreign lang="greek">ἡ δίκη</foreign> is <foreign lang="greek">ἀκριβέστερον</foreign> in various senses. See Quint. III 8.62 seq.

And this is why the <pb n="154"/> same orators don't succeed (become popular, distinguish themselves) in all these (at once): but where action or delivery is most required, <hi rend="italic">there</hi> is least of exact finish to be found&rsquo;.

Arist. et Quint., that this is not Aristotle's meaning. </p>
						<p>&lsquo;To make the further distinction, that the language must be sweet and magnificent is superfluous&rsquo;&mdash;the author of this &lsquo;distinction&rsquo; is Theodectes, in his &lsquo;Art.&rsquo; Quint. IV 2.63, <hi rend="italic">Theodectes...non magnificam modo vult esse, verum etiam iucundam expositionem</hi>&mdash;&lsquo;for why <hi rend="italic">that</hi> more <pb n="155"/> than continent (or perhaps <hi rend="italic">discreet</hi>) and liberal, or any other virtue of character (the moral virtues, of which <foreign lang="greek">μεγαλοπρέπεια</foreign> is one. Eth. Nic. II and IV)?&rsquo; For <foreign lang="greek">προσδιαιρεῖσθαι</foreign>, Brandis' <hi rend="italic">Anonymus</hi>, quoted in Schneidewin's <hi rend="italic">Philologus</hi> [IV. i.] p. 45, has <foreign lang="greek">προσδιορίζεσθαι</foreign>. </p>
						<p>&lsquo;For plainly the <hi rend="italic">sweetness</hi> will be produced by all that has been enumerated (purity, propriety, rhythm, vivacity, and the rest) if we have rightly defined what the excellence of the language consists in: for why (else, <hi rend="italic">subaudi</hi> <foreign lang="greek">ἄλλου</foreign>) must it be (as we have described it) clear, and not low (mean and common-place), but appropriate (ch. 2 &sect; 2, <foreign lang="greek">μὴ ταπεινὴν ἀλλὰ κεκοσμημένην, σεμνοτέραν,  3 ξένην</foreign>)? For if it be verbose, it is not clear; nor if it be too concise (brief)&rsquo;. <hi rend="italic">Brevis esse laboro, obscurus fio.</hi> <foreign lang="greek">ἀδολεσχεῖν</foreign>, said of idle chatter: here of verbosity, vain repetition, tautology. Comp. de Soph. El. c. 3, 165 <hi rend="italic">b</hi> 15, <foreign lang="greek">τὸ ποιῆσαι ἀδολεσχῆσαι τὸν προδιαλεγόμενον· τοῦτο δ’  ἐστὶ τὸ πολλάκις ἀναγκάζεσθαι</foreign> (by the opponent) <foreign lang="greek">ταὐτὸ λέγειν</foreign>. Comp. <hi rend="italic">supra</hi> c. 3. 3, <foreign lang="greek">τὸ ἀσαφὲς διὰ τὴν ἀδολεσχίαν</foreign>, and II 21.3, where it is applied to unnecessary accumulation of steps of proof in reasoning, or drawing inferences. </p>
						<p>&lsquo;But (on the contrary) it is quite plain (of itself, and without rule or precept) that <hi rend="italic">the mean</hi> is the appropriate style&rsquo;. Of this the preceding example is an illustration: clearness or perspicuity is the mean between the excess of garrulity, verbosity, and the defect overconciseness, in the <hi rend="italic">amount of words.</hi> &lsquo;Also the rules (ingredients) already stated will produce sweetness of language if they be well mixed, viz. the familiar (these are the <foreign lang="greek">ὀνόματα κύρια</foreign>, the customary), and the foreign (<foreign lang="greek">γλῶτται, ἐξηλλαγμένα, ξένην τὴν διάλεκτον</foreign>, c. 2 &sect; 3, c. 3 &sect; 3, sub init. <foreign lang="greek">ξενικὴν ποιεῖ τὴν λέξιν</foreign>), and the rhythm, and the plausibility that arises out of (the due observation of) propriety&rsquo; (<hi rend="italic">supra</hi> c. 7). </p>
						<p>&lsquo;We have now finished our remarks upon style or language, of all (the three branches of Rhetoric) in common (cc. 2&mdash;11), and of each kind individually (c. 12): it now remains to speak of the order (division and arrangement) of the parts of the speech&rsquo;. <pb n="156"/> </p>

					<p>Of the two divisions of this third book, proposed at the conclusion of Bk. II, and the opening of Bk. III, <foreign lang="greek">περὶ λέξεως καὶ τάξεως, πῶς χρὴ τάξαι τὰ μέρη τοῦ λόγου</foreign>, the first having been dispatched in the preceding chapters 2&mdash;12, we now proceed to the second, on the arrangement of the parts of the speech: this will include a criticism of the anterior, and the current, divisions, with a new classification in c. 13: and an explanation and discussion of the proper contents of each. A full account of the various divisions which prevailed before and after Aristotle has been already given in the Introd. p. 331, 332, and the notes, and need not be here repeated. It will be sufficient to say that Aristotle in this chapter takes the fourfold division, adopted by Isocrates, and accepted by his followers, as the author of the Rhet. ad Alex., viz. <foreign lang="greek">προοίμιον, διηγήσεις, πίστεις, ἐπίλογος</foreign>, criticizes it, and reduces it to two, <foreign lang="greek">πρόθεσις</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">πίστεις</foreign>, as the only two parts <hi rend="italic">necessary</hi> to the speech; adding notices of some superfluous distinctions introduced by Theodorus (of Byzantium) and Licymnius. [See R&ouml;ssler's pamphlet, <hi rend="italic">Rhetorum antiquorum de dispositione doctrina</hi>, pp. 30, Budissin, 1866; and Volkmann, <hi rend="italic">die Rhetorik der Griechen und R&ouml;mer</hi>, &sect; 38.] </p>
					<p>On the importance attached to the arrangement of the topics of these divisions, and especially to the order of the <hi rend="italic">proofs</hi>, Whately has some good remarks, <hi rend="italic">Rhet.</hi> c. 1 (<hi rend="italic">Encycl. Metrop.</hi> p. 256). This is illustrated by the contest between Demosthenes and Aeschines. &ldquo;Aeschines strongly urged the judges (in the celebrated contest for the Crown) to confine his adversary to the same order in his reply to the charges brought which he himself had observed in bringing them forward. Demosthenes however was far too skilful to be thus entrapped; and so much importance does he attach to the point, that he opens his speech with a most solemn appeal to the judges for an impartial hearing; which implies, he says, not only a rejection of prejudice, but no less also a permission for each speaker to adopt whatever <hi rend="italic">arrangement</hi> he should think fit. And accordingly he proceeds to adopt one very different from that which his antagonist had laid down; for he was no less sensible than his rival that the same arrangement which is the most favourable to one side, is likely to be least favourable to the other.&rdquo; </p>
					<div3 id="b3c13s1" type="section" n="1">
						<p>&lsquo;Of the speech there are (only) two parts: for it is only necessary first to state the subject, and then to prove (your side of) it. It follows from this necessary relation between them (<foreign lang="greek">διό</foreign>), that it is impossible (if the speech is to be complete) either to state your case without going on to prove it, or to prove it without having first stated it&rsquo;, (the <hi rend="italic">impossibility</hi> lies in the absurdity of the supposition: it is a <hi rend="italic">moral</hi> <pb n="157"/> impossibility): &lsquo;for proving implies <hi rend="italic">something</hi> to prove, and a preliminary statement is made in order to be proved&rsquo;. All this implies that the speaker has some object in view, some case to make out. It would not apply to all declamations; though it is true that, as a general rule, even they try to prove <hi rend="italic">something</hi>, however absurd it may be. </p>

						<p>&lsquo;Of these the one is the statement of the case (the <hi rend="italic">setting forth</hi> of all its circumstances, as a foundation for judgment and argument), the other the (rhetorical) arguments in support of it, just as if the division were (the dialectical one) the problem (alternative <hi rend="italic">question</hi> proposed or stated) and its demonstration&rsquo;. <foreign lang="greek">πρόθεσις</foreign>, <hi rend="italic">propositio:</hi> Rhet. ad Al. c. 29 (30). 2, <foreign lang="greek">προεκτιθέναι τὸ πρᾶγμα</foreign>.

						<p>&lsquo;The present&rsquo; (current, Isocrates') &lsquo;division is absurd; for surely <hi rend="italic">narrative</hi> (<foreign lang="greek">διήγησις</foreign> <hi rend="italic">narratio</hi>, the detailed description of the circumstances of the case) belongs only to the forensic speech, but in a demonstrative or public speech how can there be a <hi rend="italic">narrative</hi> such as they describe, or a <hi rend="italic">reply to the opponent;</hi> or an epilogue (peroration) in argumentative or demonstrative speeches?&rsquo; On this Quint. says, III 9. 5, <hi rend="italic">Tamen nec iis assentior qui detrahunt</hi> refutationem (sc. <foreign lang="greek">τὰ προς τὸν ἀντίδικον</foreign>) <hi rend="italic">tanquam probationi subiectam, ut Aristoteles; haec enim est quae constituat, illa quae destruat. Hoc quoque idem aliquatenus novat, quod prooemio non</hi> narrationem <hi rend="italic">subiungit, sed</hi> propositionem. (This is one of Quintilian's ordinary misrepresentations of writers whom he quotes. Ar. says nothing here of the <hi rend="italic">prooemium</hi>, theoretically disallowing it: though in compliance with the received custom he afterwards gives an account of it and its contents). <hi rend="italic">Verum id facit quia</hi> propositio <hi rend="italic">genus</hi>, narratio <hi rend="italic">species videtur: et hac non semper, illa semper et ubique credit opus esse.</hi> The last clause very well explains Ar.'s substitution of <foreign lang="greek">πρόθεσις</foreign> for (<foreign lang="greek">προοίμιον</foreign> <hi rend="italic">and</hi>) <foreign lang="greek">διήγησις</foreign>. </p>
						<p>In Introd. p. 333, I have given at length from Cic. de Inv. I 19. 27, the distinction of <foreign lang="greek">διήγησις</foreign> in its ordinary sense and <foreign lang="greek">πρόθεσις</foreign>. It is here said that the <hi rend="italic">narrative</hi> or statement of the case, strictly speaking, belongs (he means <hi rend="italic">necessarily</hi> belongs) only to the forensic branch of Rhetoric: <hi rend="italic">there</hi> there <hi rend="italic">is</hi> always a case to state: in the declamatory, panegyrical branch, not a <hi rend="italic">regular</hi> systematic narrative or detailed statement as of a case; in this the <foreign lang="greek">διήγησις</foreign> is dispersed over the whole speech, <hi rend="italic">infra</hi> 16. 1: and, in <foreign lang="greek">δημηγορία</foreign> equally, there is not universally or necessarily, as in the law-speech, a <foreign lang="greek">διήγησις</foreign>, because <pb n="158"/> its <hi rend="italic">time</hi> is the future, and a narrative of things future is impossible: when it is used, it is to recall the memory of <hi rend="italic">past facts</hi> for the purpose of comparison&mdash;which is a very different thing from the forensic <foreign lang="greek">διήγησις</foreign>. Comp. c. 16. 11. The author of the Rhet. ad Alex. c. 30 (31) includes <foreign lang="greek">διήγησις</foreign> in the deliberative branch, <foreign lang="greek">δημηγορικὸν γένος</foreign>; no doubt following Isocrates. On <foreign lang="greek">διήγησις</foreign> see Dionysius Hal., Ars Rhet. c. x &sect; 14. </p>
						<p>The same argument applies to the <hi rend="italic">refutatio</hi>, <foreign lang="greek">τὰ πρὸς τὸν ἀντίδικον</foreign>, and with more force than to the preceding, for in the epideictic branch there is no adversary, and therefore can be no refutation of his arguments, at least such as those who lay down this division intend: though it is true that a panegyrist <hi rend="italic">may</hi> have to meet adverse statements or imputations on the object of his panegyric, real or supposed. In fact, it is only in the forensic branch that there is <hi rend="italic">necessarily</hi> an opponent. On this division, see III 17. 14, 15. </p>
						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ἢ ἐπίλογον τῶν ἀποδεικτικῶν</lemma>] This is understood by Victorius, Majoragius, and Schrader of the <hi rend="italic">demonstrativum genus</hi>, <foreign lang="greek">ἀποδ</foreign>. being supposed to be put here for <foreign lang="greek">ἐπιδεικτικῶν</foreign>. This <hi rend="italic">in Aristotle</hi> I hold to be impossible. Nor have I found any example of it elsewhere, though Victorius says that Isocrates uses <foreign lang="greek">ἀποδεικνύναι</foreign> for <foreign lang="greek">ἐπιδεικνύναι</foreign> more than once in the Panath. speech. I have supposed (in note on p. 335 Introd.) that his text of Isocrates <hi rend="italic">may</hi> have exhibited this interchange from the uncorrected carelessness of transcribers. What is true is, that Isocrates, twice in the Paneg. &sect;&sect; 18 and 65, does use <foreign lang="greek">ἐπιδεικνύναι</foreign> in a sense nearly approaching, if not absolutely identical with, that of <foreign lang="greek">ἀποδεικνύναι</foreign>. The words can only mean, as I have translated them, that there may be some speeches which consist entirely of proof or arguments, and that a summary of these would not correspond to the <foreign lang="greek">ἐπίλογος</foreign> in its ordinary sense&mdash;described c. 19. 1&mdash;of which only a small part is a recapitulation. </p>
						<p>&lsquo;And again <foreign lang="greek">προοίμιον</foreign> (preface, opening or introduction), and comparison (setting over against one another side by side) of opposing (views, statements, arguments), and review, are found in public speeches <hi rend="italic">then</hi> only when there is a dispute (between <hi rend="italic">two opponents</hi>)&rsquo;: as in Demosthenes' Speech for the Crown, of which the <foreign lang="greek">προοίμιον</foreign> has been before referred to. <foreign lang="greek">ἐπάνοδος</foreign>, &lsquo;a going over again&rsquo;=<foreign lang="greek">ἀνακεφαλαίωσις</foreign>, <hi rend="italic">summary</hi> recapitulation of the foregoing topics of the speech, appears also in Plato Phaedr. 267 D, <foreign lang="greek">τὸ δὲ δὴ τέλος τῶν λόγων κοινῇ πᾶσιν ἔοικε συνδεδογμένον εἶναι, ᾧ τινὲς μὲν ἐπάνοδον, ἄλλοι δὲ ἄλλο τίθενται ὄνομα</foreign>. The <foreign lang="greek">ἄλλο ὄνομα</foreign> may be <foreign lang="greek">ἐπίλογος</foreign> or <foreign lang="greek">ἀνακεφαλαίωσις</foreign>, or <foreign lang="greek">παλιλλογία</foreign> (Rhet. ad Alex. c. 20 (21). 1). It is properly a subdivision of the <foreign lang="greek">ἐπίλογος</foreign>, and as such is here condemned as superfluous. </p>
						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ὅταν ἀντιλογία ᾖ</lemma>] &ldquo;The object of the <hi rend="italic">prooemium</hi> is to conciliate the audience, and invite their attention, and briefly intimate the subject of the ensuing speech. In recommending this or that measure to the assembly, unless there is an adversary who has poisoned the hearers' <pb n="159"/> minds against it and its author, or some other special reason, there is no occasion for this: and also, the audience is usually well acquainted with the subject. See further on this, c. 14. 11. Comparison of argument, and review, can only be required when there is an opposition.&rdquo; Introd. pp. 335, 6. The Rhet. ad Alex. expressly tells us, c. 28 (29) ult., that the <foreign lang="greek">προοίμιον</foreign> is &ldquo;common to all the seven species, and will be appropriate to every kind of (rhetorical) business.&rdquo; </p>
						<p>The following argument <foreign lang="greek">καὶ γὰρπολλάκις</foreign> is a <hi rend="italic">reductio ad absurdum</hi> of the preceding. You say that <foreign lang="greek">προοίμιον, ἀντιπαραβολή</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">ἐπάνοδος</foreign> are essential parts of the public speech&mdash;&lsquo;Why at that rate (is the reply) so are accusation and defence, for they <hi rend="italic">are</hi> frequently there&rsquo;&mdash;this involves the absurdity of introducing the <hi rend="italic">whole contents</hi> of the forensic genus into the <foreign lang="greek">δημηγορικὸν γένος</foreign> as a mere <hi rend="italic">part</hi> of the latter&mdash;&lsquo;but not <hi rend="italic">qua</hi> deliberation&rsquo;: not in the sense or character of deliberation, which is <hi rend="italic">essential</hi> to the deliberative branch, but as mere accidents. </p>
						<p>There can be no question that we should read <foreign lang="greek">ᾗ</foreign> for <foreign lang="greek">ἡ συμβουλή</foreign>. So Victorius, Schrader, Buhle, Spengel. Bekker alone retains <foreign lang="greek">ἡ</foreign>. The following clause requires an alteration of punctuation to make it intelligible; suggested long ago by Victorius, Majoragius, Vater, and adopted by Spengel; <hi rend="italic">not</hi> so by Bekker. Spengel also rejects <foreign lang="greek">ἔτι</foreign> [<hi rend="italic">delendum aut in</hi> <foreign lang="greek">ἐστὶν</foreign> <hi rend="italic">mutandum</hi>]. With the altered reading, <foreign lang="greek">ἀλλ’  ὁ ἐπίλογος ἔτι οὐδὲ δικανικοῦ κ.τ.λ.</foreign> it is certainly out of place. I am by no means persuaded of the certainty of this alteration&mdash;perhaps Bekker had the same reason for withholding his consent to the two alterations&mdash;I think it quite as likely that a word or two has dropt out after <foreign lang="greek">ἐπίλογος</foreign>. </p>
						<p>&lsquo;But further&rsquo; (if <foreign lang="greek">ἔτι</foreign> be <hi rend="italic">retained</hi>) &lsquo;neither does the peroration belong to every forensic speech; as for instance if it be short, or the matter of it easy to recollect; for what happens (in an ordinary epilogue) is a subtraction from the length&rsquo;&mdash;not the brevity, of a speech: i.e. an epilogue is appropriate to a long speech, not a short one. This is Victorius' explanation, and no doubt right (that which I gave in the Introd. is wrong, and also <hi rend="italic">not</hi> Victorius', as stated in the note). </p>
						<p>&lsquo;Consequently the (only) necessary parts are the statement of the case, and the proof&rsquo;. </p>
					</div3>
					<div3 id="b3c13s4" type="section" n="4">
						<p>&lsquo;Now these two are peculiar to, and characteristic of, speeches in general&rsquo;. </p>
						<p>It is possible that <foreign lang="greek">ἴδιον</foreign> here may be the <hi rend="italic">proprium</hi> of logic, one of the predicables: that which characterizes a thing, without being absolutely <pb n="160"/> <hi rend="italic">essential</hi> to it, as the <hi rend="italic">genus</hi> and <hi rend="italic">differentia</hi> are. The <hi rend="italic">proprium</hi> is a <hi rend="italic">necessary</hi> accident or property, though it is not of the essence itself: &ldquo;but flowing from, or a consequence of, the essence, is inseparably attached to the species&rdquo; (J. S. Mill, <hi rend="italic">Logic</hi>, I p. 148). All this would apply very well to these two <hi rend="italic">parts.</hi> They are not of the essence of the speech, and do not enter into the definition: the speech could exist without them. At the same time they are immediate consequences of that essence, and inseparably attached to all species of speeches, according to the view put forward here. </p>
						<p>We might therefore be satisfied with these. &lsquo;If we add more&rsquo; (following the authorities on the subject), &lsquo;they must be at the most, preface, statement of case, confirmatory arguments, conclusion: for the refutation of the adversary belongs to the proofs&rsquo; (Quint. u.s. III 9. 5, <hi rend="italic">Tamen nec iis assentior qui detrahunt</hi> refutationem, <hi rend="italic">tanquam probationi subiectam, ut Aristoteles; haec enim est quae constituat, illa quae destruat</hi>), &lsquo;and counter-comparison, (a comparative statement of your own views and arguments placed in juxtaposition with them to bring them into contrast,) which, being as it is a magnifying (making the most) of one's own case, must be a part of the confirmatory arguments, or general proof: for one who does this proves something: but not so the prologue; nor the epilogue, which merely recalls to mind&rsquo;. </p>
					</div3>
					<div3 id="b3c13s5" type="section" n="5">
						<p>&lsquo;Such divisions, if any one choose to make them, will be pretty much the same as the inventions of Theodorus and his school, that is, to distinguish narration from after-narration and fore-narration, and refutation and per-re-refutation&rsquo;. In this compound word <foreign lang="greek">ἐπί</foreign> &lsquo;in addition&rsquo; is represented by <hi rend="italic">re</hi>, and <foreign lang="greek">ἐξ</foreign>, &lsquo;out and out&rsquo;, &lsquo;outright&rsquo;, &lsquo;<hi rend="italic">thoroughly</hi>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<hi rend="italic">completely</hi>&rsquo; by <hi rend="italic">per.</hi> <foreign lang="greek">διά</foreign> and <hi rend="italic">per</hi> in composition are the more usual and direct exponents of &lsquo;thoroughness&rsquo; or &lsquo;complete carrying through&rsquo;, of a thing. On <foreign lang="greek">ἐπιδιήγησις</foreign>, <hi rend="italic">repetita narratio</hi>, see Quint. IV 2. 128, <hi rend="italic">res declamatoria magis quam forensis.</hi> He accepts it as a division, but thinks it should be rarely used. Plato, Phaedr. 266 D seq., in speaking of these same superfluous divisions of Theodorus, leaves out <foreign lang="greek">ἐπι-</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">προ-διήγησις</foreign>, and introduces <foreign lang="greek">πίστωσιν καὶ ἐπιπίστωσιν</foreign> in their place. These plainly correspond to the other pair <foreign lang="greek">ἔλεγχος</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">ἐπεξέλεγχος</foreign>, the one being confirmatory, the other refutatory arguments. See <hi rend="italic">Camb. Journ. of Cl. and Sacred Phil.</hi> No. IX. Vol. III p. 285, and Thompson's notes on the Phaedrus. </p>
						<p>The general drift of the last clause is this; if you introduce such divisions at all, you may go on dividing and subdividing for ever, as Theodorus does in his <foreign lang="greek">τέχνη</foreign>. This is followed by the statement of the true <pb n="161"/> principle of division: the foundation of <hi rend="italic">my own</hi> twofold division, hints Ar. &lsquo;But a name (like one of these, the class-name, or, as here, the name of a division) should be given to mark a kind and a specific difference&rsquo;. It is the genus <hi rend="italic">plus</hi> the specific (<foreign lang="greek">εἰδοποιός</foreign>, species-making) difference that constitutes the distinct species or <hi rend="italic">kind.</hi> Now these <hi rend="italic">names</hi>, though supposed to mark distinct kinds, <hi rend="italic">have</hi> no specific differences which thus distinguish them. A special name demands a real distinction of kinds. Waitz ad Categ. 1 <hi rend="italic">b</hi> 17. Trendelenburg, <hi rend="italic">El. Log. Ar.</hi> &sect; 59. </p>
						<p>&lsquo;Otherwise they become empty and frivolous, such as Licymnius' inventions in his art, the names which he coins, <foreign lang="greek">ἐπούρωσις, ἀποπλάνησις</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">ὄζοι</foreign>&rsquo;. On Licymnius and his productions, see Heindorf ad Phaedr. u. s. p. 242, and <hi rend="italic">Camb. Journ. of Cl.and Sacred Phil.</hi> No. IX. Vol. III pp. 255&mdash;7; where an attempt is made to explain these three obscure names. Licymnius was a dithyrambic poet, <hi rend="italic">supra</hi> III 12. 2, as well as a rhetorician, and his prose style seems to have participated in the dithyrambic character. <foreign lang="greek">ἐπούρωσις</foreign> I take to be a word coined by Licymnius for his own purposes: it is a <foreign lang="greek">ἅπαξ λεγόμενον</foreign>. It seems to be formed from <foreign lang="greek">ἐπουροῦν</foreign>, a synonym of <foreign lang="greek">ἐπουρίζειν</foreign>, &lsquo;to speed onward by a fair gale&rsquo;, also <foreign lang="greek">συνεπουρίζειν</foreign>, Hist. Anim. VIII 13. 9, de Caelo, III 2. 17: Polybius has <foreign lang="greek">ἐπουροῦν</foreign> II 10. 6, and <foreign lang="greek">κατουροῦν</foreign>, I 44. 3, 61. 7, both as neut. The Schol. quoted by Spengel, <hi rend="italic">Artium Scriptores</hi> p. 89, defines <foreign lang="greek">ἐπόρουσις</foreign> (<foreign lang="greek">ἐπούρωσις</foreign>) <foreign lang="greek">τὰ συνευπορίζοντα καὶ βοηθοῦντα τοῖς ἐνθυμήμασι, καὶ ἁπλῶς ὅσα λέγονται βοηθοῦντα τῇ ἀποδείξει</foreign>. All which seems to favour the notion that the figurative rhetorician represented &lsquo;subsidiary&rsquo; or &lsquo;confirmatory arguments&rsquo;, Theodorus' <foreign lang="greek">πίστωσις</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">ἐπιπίστωσις</foreign>, under the image of &lsquo;a fair wind astern&rsquo;. <foreign lang="greek">ἀποπλάνησις</foreign> is no doubt, as in Plato Polit. 263 C, &lsquo;a digression&rsquo;, <hi rend="italic">wandering off</hi> from the main subject, Schol. <foreign lang="greek">τὰ ἔξω τοῦ πράγματος</foreign>; and <foreign lang="greek">ὄζοι</foreign>, &lsquo;branches&rsquo;, most likely means places in which the discourse &lsquo;branches off&rsquo; in different directions, &lsquo;ramifications&rsquo;: unless the same Scholiast's explanation be preferred, <foreign lang="greek">τὰ ἄκρα, ἤτοι τὰ προοίμια καὶ τοὺς ἐπιλόγους</foreign>. This would mean the &lsquo;branches&rsquo; opposed to the stock or trunk, as something extraneous, or at all events non-essential. (I think this <hi rend="italic">is</hi> preferable.) </p>

					<p>Having considered the divisions of the speech in general we now come to the details, to the enumeration and examination of the ordinary contents of each of the four. These in each case are discussed under the heads of the three branches of Rhetoric. The treatment of the <foreign lang="greek">προοίμιον</foreign> occupies the 14th chapter, to which is appended a second, c. xv, which analyses the topics of <foreign lang="greek">διαβολή</foreign>, the art of &lsquo;setting a man against his neighbour&rsquo;, infusing suspicion and hostile feeling against him in the minds of others, raising a prejudice against him&mdash;especially of course in the minds of judges against your opponent.

					<p>The <hi rend="italic">prooemium</hi> is thus defined by the author of the Rhet. ad Alex. c. 29 (30). I, <foreign lang="greek">ἀκροατῶν παρασκευὴ καὶ τοῦ πράγματος ἐν κεφαλαίῳ μὴ εἰδόσι δήλωσις, ἵνα γιγνώσκωσι περὶ ὧν ὁ λόγος παρακολουθῶσί τε τῇ ὑποθέσει, καὶ ἐπὶ τὸ προσέχειν παρακαλέσαι, καὶ καθ’  ὅσον τῷ λόγῳ δυνατὸν εὔνους ἡμῖν αὐτοῖς ποιῆσαι</foreign>. These rules seem to be chiefly derived from the actual practice of the Orators. Some of the arts to which public speakers had recourse in the topics of their <hi rend="italic">prooemium</hi> are mentioned by Isocrates, Paneg. &sect; 13. Compare Cic. de Orat. II 19. 80; de Invent. I 15. 20; where it is defined: it has two parts, <hi rend="italic">principium</hi> (the object of this is to make the hearer <hi rend="italic">benevolum aut docilem aut attentum</hi>,) and <hi rend="italic">insinuatio, oratio quadam dissimulatione et circuitione obscura subiens auditoris animum.</hi> Quint. IV. c. I, seq. <hi rend="italic">principium exordium.</hi> He agrees with the preceding; see &sect; 5. On the <foreign lang="greek">προοίμιον</foreign> as a <hi rend="italic">hymn</hi>, see Stallbaum ad Phaed. 60 D. On the <hi rend="italic">prooemium</hi> in Rhetoric, Cic. de Orat.

					<div3 id="b3c14s1" type="section" n="1">
						<p>&lsquo;Now the <hi rend="italic">prooemium</hi> is the beginning of a speech and stands in the place of the prologue in poetry (i. e. tragedy, and specially of Euripides' tragedy), and of the prelude in flute music&rsquo;. </p>
						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">προαύλιον</lemma>] an introduction, ornamental, and preparatory to, not an essential part of, the theme or subject of the composition; for all these are <hi rend="italic">beginnings</hi>, and as it were a paving of the way (preparation, pioneering of the road) for what follows (<foreign lang="greek">ὁδοποίησις</foreign>, note on I 1. 2). </p>
						<p>&lsquo;Now the flute-prelude is like the <hi rend="italic">prooemium</hi> of the epideictic branch: that is to say, as the flute-players first open their performance with whatever they can play best (in order to gain attention and favour of the audience) which they then join on to the <foreign lang="greek">ἐνδόσιμον</foreign> (the actual opening, preliminary notes, of the subject which gives the tone, or cue, to the rest), so in the epideictic speeches the writing (of the <foreign lang="greek">προοίμιον</foreign>) ought to be of this kind: for (in these the speaker) may say first (<foreign lang="greek">εἰπόντα</foreign>) anything he pleases, and then should at once sound the note of preparation, and join on (the rest)&rsquo;. </p>
						<p>This represents the epideictic <hi rend="italic">prooemium</hi>, like the flute-prelude, as hardly at all connected with what follows; it is a preliminary flourish, anything that he knows to be likely to be most successful, as already observed, to conciliate the audience and put them in good humour. &ldquo;For here, as there is no real interest at stake, the author is allowed a much greater liberty in his choice of topics for amusing (and gaining <pb n="163"/> over) an audience; a license which would be intolerable in a case of life and death, or in the suggestion of a course of action which may involve the safety or ruin of the state. Here the audience are too eager to come to the point to admit of any trifling with their anxiety.&rdquo; Introd. pp. 337, 8. Cic. de Or. II 80. 325, <hi rend="italic">Connexum autem ita sit principium consequenti orationi, ut non tanquam</hi> citharoedi prooemium <hi rend="italic">affictum aliquod, sed cohaerens cum omni corpore membrum esse videatur</hi> (Victorius).

V (VIII) 5 <hi rend="italic">init.</hi> apparently in the same sense as here, &lsquo;introduction&rsquo;; also Pseudo-Arist. de Mundo, c. 6 &sect; 20, where we have <foreign lang="greek">κατὰ γὰρ τὸ ἄνωθεν ἐνδόσιμον ὑπὸ τοῦ φερωνύμως ἂν κορυφαίου προσαγορευθέντος κινεῖται μὲν τὰ ἄστρα κ.τ.λ.</foreign> &lsquo;for according to the law above, by him who might be rightly called leader of the chorus, the stars are set in motion, &amp;c.&rsquo; I have given this in full because it throws some light upon the meaning of <foreign lang="greek">ἐνδόσιμον</foreign>, and explains its metaphorical application, God is here represented as the leader of a chorus who gives the time, the keynote, and the mode or tune, to the rest, and thus acts as a guide to be followed, or (in a similar sense) as an introduction, or preparatory transition to something else. It thus has the effect of the &lsquo;key-note&rsquo;, and takes the secondary sense of a &lsquo;guide&rsquo;, &lsquo;preparation for&rsquo;, &lsquo;introduction to&rsquo;, anything. So Plut. de disc. adul. ab amico, c. 55, 73 B, <foreign lang="greek">ὥσπερ ἐνδόσιμον ἕξει πρὸς τὰ μείζονα τῶν ἁμαρτημάτων</foreign>, ubi Wyttenbach, <hi rend="italic">occasio, incitamentum;</hi> similarly Ib. c. 30, 70 B, <foreign lang="greek">καὶ ψόγος...ἢ ἔπαινος ὥσπερ ἐνδόσιμον εἰς παῤῥησίαν ἐστιν</foreign>, &lsquo;gives the tone, the cue, i.e. the occasion or incitement, to freedom (taking liberties).&rsquo; See other passages from Plutarch and others in Wyttenbach's note on 73 B. Gaisford and Wyttenbach refer to Gataker ad Anton. XI 20, p. 336 (G), XI 26 (W), &ldquo;<foreign lang="greek">ἐνδ</foreign>. usurpatur pro <hi rend="italic">modulationis exordio</hi>, quo praecentor sive chori praefectus cantandi reliquis auspicium facit. Hesychius, <foreign lang="greek">ἐνδόσιμον, τὸ πρὸ τῆς ᾠδῆς κιθάρισμα</foreign>.&rdquo; ap. Gaisford <hi rend="italic">Not. Var.</hi> Wyttenbach describes <foreign lang="greek">ἐνδόσιμον</foreign> as &ldquo;signum et adhortatio in certaminibus et musicis et gymnicis: tum ad alias res translatum.&rdquo; Lastly Athen. XIII 2, 556 A, of certain authors, <foreign lang="greek">οἷς τὸ ἐνδόσιμον Ἀριστοτέλης ἔδωκεν ἱστορῶν τοῦτο ἐν τῷ περὶ εὐγενείας</foreign>, &lsquo;gave the tone, i.e. hint&rsquo;, furnished the occasion for their statement. Schweigh&auml;user, ad loc. says, &ldquo;Dalecampius vertit <hi rend="italic">quos ad id scribendum provocavit Ar.</hi> Dicitur autem proprie <hi rend="italic">praecentus praeludium, exordium melodiae quod praeit chorodidascalus cui dein accinere oportet chorum.</hi> H.

						<p>&lsquo;And this is done by all. An example is the <hi rend="italic">prooemium</hi> of Isocrates' Helen: for there is nothing in common between the disputatious dia<pb n="164"/> lecticians, and Helen&rsquo;. The <hi rend="italic">prooemium</hi>, which occupies the first thirteen sections of the speech, includes many other subjects besides the <foreign lang="greek">ἐριστικοί</foreign>, and is certainly an excellent illustration of the want of connexion between proem and the rest in an epideictic speech. Quint. III 8. 8, <hi rend="italic">In demonstrativis vero prooemia esse maxime libera existimat</hi> (Ar.). <hi rend="italic">Nam et longe a materia duci hoc, ut in Helenae laude Isocrates fecerit; et ex aliqua rei vicinia, ut idem in Panegyrico, cum queritur plus honoris corporum quam animorum virtutibus dari.</hi> </p>
						<p>&lsquo;And at the same time also (it has this further recommendation) that if (the speaker thus) migrate into a foreign region, there is this propriety in it, that the entire speech is not of the same kind&rsquo; (it removes the wearisome monotony which is characteristic of this branch of Rhetoric). </p>
						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ἐκτοπίζειν</lemma> is to &lsquo;change one's residence&rsquo;, and applied especially to migratory birds and animals. It is always neuter in Aristotle. Hist. Anim. VIII 12. 3 and 8, IX 10. 1, IV 8. 23, <foreign lang="greek">ἐκτοπισμοὺς ποιοῦνται</foreign>, VIII 13. 14, <foreign lang="greek">ἐκτοπιστικὰ ζῷα</foreign>, I 1. 26. In the primary sense of absence from one's proper or ordinary place, Pol. VIII (v) 11, 1314 <hi rend="italic">b</hi> 9, <foreign lang="greek">τοῖς ἐκτοπίζουσι τυράννοις ἀπὸ τῆς οἰκείας</foreign>, and so <foreign lang="greek">ἔκτοπος, ἐκτόπιος, ἄτοπος</foreign> &lsquo;out of their proper place&rsquo;. </p>
					</div3>
					<div3 id="b3c14s2" type="section" n="2">
						<p>&lsquo;The introductions in the epideictic branch are derived from praise and blame (naturally: see 1 3 &sect;&sect; 3, 4); as, for instance, Gorgias' opening of his Olympic oration (a <foreign lang="greek">πανηγυρικὸς λόγος</foreign>, delivered at the Olympic games), &ldquo;By many&rsquo; (or <foreign lang="greek">ὑπέρ</foreign>, &lsquo;for many things&rsquo;; which seems more in accordance with what followed) &lsquo;are ye worthy to be admired, O men of Hellas&rdquo;: that is to say (<foreign lang="greek">γάρ</foreign> <hi rend="italic">videlicet</hi>) he praises those who first brought together the general assemblies&rsquo;. Comp. Quint. III 8. 9, (continuation of the preceding quotation) <hi rend="italic">et Gorgias in Olympico laudans eos qui primi tales instituerunt conventus</hi> (translated from Ar.). Another short fragment of this oration is preserved by Philostr. Vit. Soph. 1 9. <foreign lang="greek">Ὁ δὲ Ὀλυμπικὸς λόγος</foreign>, says Philostratus, <foreign lang="greek">ὑπὲρ τοῦ μεγίστου αὐτῷ</foreign> (Gorgiae) <foreign lang="greek">ἐπολιτεύθη· στασιάζουσαν γὰρ τὴν Ἑλλάδα ὁρῶν ὁμονοίας ξύμβουλος αὐτοῖς ἐγένετο τρέπων ἐπὶ τοὺς βαρβάρους καὶ πείθων ἆθλα ποιεῖσθαι τῶν ὅπλων μὴ τὰς ἀλλήλων πόλεις ἀλλὰ τὴν τῶν βαρβάρων χώραν</foreign>.

						<p>&lsquo;But Isocrates blames them for that bodily excellences they rewarded with gifts, whilst to intellectual excellence they awarded no prize&rsquo;. This is the <hi rend="italic">substance</hi> of the two first sections of Isocr. Paneg. Mr Sandys, in his note <hi rend="italic">ad locum</hi>, gives a summary of the whole exordium &sect;&sect; 1&mdash;14. Victorius points out this as one of the places in which Aristotle's hostility to Isocrates appears! The <hi rend="italic">problem</hi> here proposed by Isocr.&mdash;the omission of the institution of prizes for intellectual competition&mdash;is solved by Arist., Probl. XXX 11. </p>

						<p>&lsquo;(A second topic for an epideictic <hi rend="italic">prooemium</hi>) is derived from <hi rend="italic">advice</hi> (the deliberative branch); for instance &ldquo;men are bound to pay honour to the good&rdquo;, and therefore he, the speaker, himself is going to praise Aristides&rsquo; (<foreign lang="greek">αὐτός</foreign> is <hi rend="italic">obliqua oratio:</hi> the <hi rend="italic">directa oratio</hi> would have been <foreign lang="greek">ἐγώ</foreign>: it is a sort of semi-quotation: where it comes from no one seems to know); &lsquo;or, to all such as though not distinguished are yet not bad, only their merits are buried in obscurity, as Alexander (Paris), Priam's son. For one who speaks thus offers advice&rsquo;. The <hi rend="italic">encomium Alexandri</hi> here referred is doubtless the same as that which has been already mentioned in II 23. 5, 8, 12 and II 27. 7, 9; the author is unknown. </p>

						<p>&lsquo;Further (a third kind) they may be borrowed from the forensic introductions; that is to say, from the appeals to the audience, or as an apology to them, (comp. <hi rend="italic">infra</hi> &sect; 7)&mdash;when the subject of the speech happens to be either paradoxical (contrary to ordinary opinion or expectation, and therefore <hi rend="italic">incredible</hi>), or painful<note anchored="yes"><foreign lang="greek">χαλεποῦ</foreign>, Victorius, Majoragius, <hi rend="italic">ardua</hi>; Vet.

[Compare Virgil's <hi rend="italic">omnia iam vulgata</hi> in the Exordium of the third Georgic.] </p>
						<p>Of the four Choeriluses distinguished by N&auml;ke, this is the Epic poet of Samos, born, according to N&auml;ke, in B.C. 470. His principal work, from which this fragment is taken, was a poetical narrative of the Persian wars with Greece under Darius and Xerxes&mdash;&ldquo;all that was left him&rdquo; by his predecessors&mdash;very much applauded, as Suidas tell us, and &ldquo;decreed to be read with Homer.&rdquo; Aristotle (Top. <foreign lang="greek">Θ</foreign> I, ult. <foreign lang="greek">παραδείγματα...οἷα Ὅμηρος, μὴ οἷα Χοίριλος</foreign>) thinks less favourably of it; and it was afterwards excluded from the Alexandrian Canon in favour of the poem of Antimachus. An earlier Choerilus was the Athenian tragic poet, contemporary with Phrynichus, Pratinas, and Aeschylus in early life; the third a slave of the Comic poet Ecphantides, whom he is said to have assisted in the composition of his plays; and the fourth, Horace's Choerilus, Ep. II 1. 232, Ars Poet. 357, a later and contemptible epic poet who attended Alexander on his expedition, and according to Horace, <hi rend="italic">incultis qui versibus et male natis rettulit acceptos, regale nomisma, Philippos.</hi> Suidas tells this story of the Samian Choerilus, an evident mistake. The fragments of the Choerilus of our text are all collected and commented on by N&auml;ke in his volume on Choerilus. This fragm. is given on p. 104. See also D&uuml;ntzer <hi rend="italic">Epic. Gr. Fragm.</hi> p. 96 seq. where five lines of the poem, from which our extract is made are given: and the four articles in <hi rend="italic">Biogr. Dict.</hi> The context is supplied by the Schol. on this passage&mdash;see in Spengel's ed., <hi rend="italic">Scholia Graeca</hi><note anchored="yes">On these Scholia, see Spengel, Praef. ad Rhet., p. VIII.</note>, p. 160: printed also in N&auml;ke and D&uuml;ntzer&mdash;and runs thus: <emph><foreign lang="greek">ἆ μάκαρ, ὅστις ἔην κεῖνον χρόνον ἴδρις ἀοιδῆς, Μουσάων θεράπων ὅτ’  ἀκήρατος ἦν ἔτι λειμών· νῦν δ̓ ὅτε πάντα δέδασται, ἔχουσι δὲ πείρατα τέχναι, ὕστατοι ὥστε δρόμου καταλειπόμεθ̓, οὐδέ πῃ ἐστὶ πάντη παπταίνοντα νεοζυγὲς ἅρμα πελάσσαι. καὶ τὰ ἑξῆς</foreign></emph><note anchored="yes" n="2">N&auml;ke, <hi rend="italic">Choerilus</hi> p. 105, thinks that this, and not the second fragm. in &sect; 6&mdash; as Buhle, Wolf, Vater, agree in supposing&mdash;was the opening of the poem. This is rendered probable by the <foreign lang="greek">λόγον ἄ λ λ ο ν</foreign> in v. I, of the other.</note>. Which are certainly pretty lines enough: perhaps the rest was not equal to them. Compare with <foreign lang="greek">λειμὼν Μουσάων</foreign>, and the whole passage, Lucr. I 925 seq. <hi rend="italic">avia Pieridum peragro loca, nullius ante trita solo</hi>, et seq., which might <hi rend="italic">possibly</hi> have been suggested by this of Choerilus. An apology of the same kind is introduced by Isocrates in the <hi rend="italic">middle</hi> of his Panegyr. &sect; 74; and another in his <foreign lang="greek">ἀντίδοσις</foreign>, &sect; 55. In the latter the word <foreign lang="greek">διατεθρυλημένους</foreign> occurs. <pb n="167"/> </p>
						<p>&lsquo;So the introductions of the epideictic speeches are derived from the following topics; from praise, blame, exhortation, dissuasion, appeals to the hearer: and these &ldquo;introductions&rdquo;&rsquo; (see the note on &sect; I: <foreign lang="greek">ἐνδόσιμα</foreign> is used here for <foreign lang="greek">προοίμια</foreign> in general, instead of the more limited sense of the preceding passage) &lsquo;must be either foreign or closely connected with the speeches (to which they are prefixed)&rsquo;. </p>
						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ξένος</lemma>, a stranger or foreigner, is properly opposed to <foreign lang="greek">οἰκεῖος</foreign>, <hi rend="italic">domesticus</hi>, one of one's own household. This last clause, <foreign lang="greek">δεῖ δέ κ.τ.λ.</foreign> is, as Vater remarks, introduced as a transition to the next topic, the forensic <hi rend="italic">prooemia.</hi> </p>
					</div3>
					<div3 id="b3c14s5" type="section" n="5">
						<p>&lsquo;The introduction of the forensic speech must be understood as having the same force (or value, or signification) as the prologue of a drama (<foreign lang="greek">τοῦ</foreign>, the drama to which it belongs), or the introduction to an epic poem: for to the epideictic <hi rend="italic">exordia</hi> the preludes (introductions, <foreign lang="greek">ἀναβολαί</foreign>) of the dithyrambs bear resemblance, &ldquo;for thee and thy gifts, or spoils&rdquo;&rsquo;. On the <foreign lang="greek">ἀναβολαί</foreign>, the openings or introductions of dithyrambs, and their loose, incoherent, flighty character, see note on III 9. 1. Introd. p. 307, note 1. It is this which makes them comparable to the epideictic exordia, as above described. </p>
						<p>The dramatic, i. e. tragic, prologue, and the introduction of the epic, are compared to the exordium of the dicastic speech, in that all three contain &lsquo;statements of the case&rsquo;; the last, literally; the tragic and epic, virtually. The prologue of Euripides (who of the three extant tragedians can be the only one whose prologues are referred to) actually states all the preceding circumstances of the story of the drama, which it is necessary that the spectator should be acquainted with in order to enter into the plot. The introduction of the Epic poem is neither so long nor so regular. That of the Iliad occupies only seven lines, and states the subject very simply and in few words. That of the Odyssey is concluded in ten, and little or nothing of the story told. The Aeneid, and Pharsalia have seven apiece. </p>
					</div3>
					<div3 id="b3c14s6" type="section" n="6">
						<p>Having hinted at the points of resemblance between the dithyrambic <foreign lang="greek">ἀναβολαί</foreign> and the epideictic <hi rend="italic">prooemia</hi>, he now proceeds to explain further the resemblance of the dicastic proem to the prologue of tragedy and prelude of the Epic poem. </p>
						<p>&lsquo;In the prose speeches as well as the poetry&rsquo; (Victorius understands <pb n="168"/> <foreign lang="greek">τ. λόγοις</foreign><note anchored="yes">Spengel puts <foreign lang="greek">λόγοις καὶ</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">ἦν</foreign> in brackets, as spurious or doubtful: Bekker retains <foreign lang="greek">ἦν</foreign>. MS A^{c} has <foreign lang="greek">ἠῖ</foreign>. By rejecting the words Spengel seems to shew that he thinks that <foreign lang="greek">λόγοι</foreign> alone cannot mean &lsquo;stories&rsquo; in the sense of <hi rend="italic">dramas.</hi> I think it is doubtful. Otherwise, this interpretation is certainly more suitable to the general connexion and what follows. On the other hand, our author here seems to be rather digressive, and <hi rend="italic">not</hi> to observe any very regular order of succession in his remarks. So that perhaps upon the whole, we may let the other consideration have its due weight in deciding the point.</note>, <hi rend="italic">fabulae poetarum</hi>, meaning the <hi rend="italic">dramas</hi> as contrasted with the Epics: the other contrast of <hi rend="italic">prose</hi> and <hi rend="italic">verse</hi> is more natural as well as more suitable here) &lsquo;these <hi rend="italic">prooemia</hi> are (present, offer) a specimen or sample of the subject (of the speech or poem) in order that they may have some previous acquaintance with the intention of it&rsquo; (if <foreign lang="greek">ἦν</foreign>, &lsquo;about what it was to be&rsquo;, as in <foreign lang="greek">τὸ τί ἦν εἶναι</foreign>; the object, purpose, or design), &lsquo;and the mind not be kept in suspense; for all that is vague and indefinite keeps the mind wandering (in doubt and uncertainty): accordingly, (the speaker or writer) that puts the beginning into his hand supplies him with a clue, as it were, by which he may hold, so as to enable him to follow the story (or argument). This is why (Homer in the Iliad and Odyssey, <hi rend="italic">began</hi> the two poems with the lines quoted; and Choerilus&mdash;if N&auml;ke u. s. is right about the order of the two fragments in our text&mdash;did not <hi rend="italic">begin</hi> his poem with <foreign lang="greek">ἥγεό μοι κ.τ.λ.</foreign>, but introduced it in his <hi rend="italic">exordium</hi>)&rsquo;&mdash;here the quotations from the three poems are introduced, and the sentence remains unfinished. </p>
						<p>&lsquo;Similarly the tragic poets explain the subject of their play, if not immediately at the opening, as Euripides, at any rate somewhere or other the poet explains it in his prologue or introduction), as <hi rend="italic">even</hi> Sophocles (who does not <hi rend="italic">usually</hi> employ it; in the Oedip. Tyr. 774 seq.) &ldquo;Polybus of Corinth was my father, &amp;c.&rdquo;, and the following.&rsquo; </p>
						<p>&ldquo;The Commentators object to <foreign lang="greek">προλόγῳ</foreign> here because the passage that it indicates occurs not at the beginning, but in the middle of the play. But, it seems that Aristotle has here used <foreign lang="greek">πρόλογος</foreign> in a more compre<pb n="169"/> hensive sense than that which it usually bears, for an &lsquo;explanatory introduction&rsquo; in general, wherever it may occur: and that it has much the same relation here to its <hi rend="italic">ordinary</hi> signification, as <foreign lang="greek">πρόθεσις</foreign> has to <foreign lang="greek">διήγησις</foreign> in c. 13. Also the analogous <foreign lang="greek">προοίμιον</foreign> is applied twice in &sect; 10 <hi rend="italic">infra</hi> to introductory speeches <hi rend="italic">anywhere</hi> in a play.&rdquo; Introd. p. 339 note. </p>
						<p>&lsquo;And comedy in like manner&rsquo;: that is, wherever an introductory explanation is required, there it is introduced. Victorius notes that this appears in Terence, the Latin representative of the New Comedy, and Plautus. Simo in the <hi rend="italic">Andria</hi>, Menedemus in the <hi rend="italic">Heautontimorumenos</hi>, Micio in the <hi rend="italic">Adelphi</hi>, perform this office. And similarly, Strepsiades in Aristoph. Nubes, Demosthenes in the Equites 40 seq., Dionysius in the Ranae&mdash;Victorius says &ldquo;tum maxime cum <hi rend="italic">Servo</hi> narrat, &amp;c.,&rdquo; but the conversation referred to is with Hercules, not Xanthias, lines 64 seq. There is another explanatory introduction, preparatory to the dramatic contest between Aeacus and Xanthias, 759 seq. </p>
						<p>&lsquo;So then (to resume) the most necessary function of the <hi rend="italic">prooemium</hi>, and <hi rend="italic">that</hi> peculiar to it, is to make it clear what is the end and object of the speech or story&rsquo; (the former is the <foreign lang="greek">λόγος</foreign> in <hi rend="italic">Rhetoric</hi>, the latter in the Epic and the drama). Compare Rhet. ad Alex. 29 (30). I, def. of <foreign lang="greek">προοίμιον</foreign>. &lsquo;And therefore if the subject (the thing, the matter in hand) be already clear and short (or, of trifling importance) the <hi rend="italic">prooemium</hi> is not to be employed&rsquo;.

						<p>&lsquo;The other kinds (of <hi rend="italic">prooemia</hi>) which are employed are mere cures (remedies [specifics] for the infirmities or defects of the hearers&mdash;<foreign lang="greek">διὰ τὴν τοῦ ἀκροατοῦ μοχθηρίαν</foreign>, III 1. 5&mdash;such as inattention, unfavourable disposition, and the like), and common&rsquo;, to all parts of the speech. <foreign lang="greek">κοινά</foreign> is opposed to the <hi rend="italic">special</hi> office, peculiar to the <foreign lang="greek">προοίμιον, καὶ ἴδιον τοῦτο</foreign> supra. all these <hi rend="italic">other</hi> kinds <hi rend="italic">may</hi> be introduced in the exordium&mdash;and also anywhere else, wherever they are required. </p>
						<p>&lsquo;These may be derived from the speaker himself, from the hearer, the subject, and the adversary&rsquo; (&lsquo;the opposite&rsquo;). Cic. de Or. II 79. 321, seq. <hi rend="italic">Sed quum erit utendum principio, quod plerumque erit, aut ex reo, aut ex adversario, aut ex re, aut ex eis apud quos agitur</hi> (<foreign lang="greek">ἐκ τοῦ ἀκρουτοῦ</foreign>), <hi rend="italic">sententias duci licebit. Ex reo</hi>&mdash;reos <hi rend="italic">appello, quorum</hi> res <hi rend="italic">est&mdash;quae significent bonum virum</hi> seq. followed by the illustration of <pb n="170"/> the remaining three. Cicero, who is certainly following Arist., seems here to translate <foreign lang="greek">τοῦ λέγοντος</foreign> by <hi rend="italic">reus</hi>, in the sense which he explains, of <hi rend="italic">both parties</hi> in the case. Quintilian, IV 1. 6, seems to charge Aristotle&mdash; if he includes him in the <hi rend="italic">plerique</hi> who have been guilty of the omission&mdash; with having neglected to include the &lsquo;<hi rend="italic">auctor causae</hi>&rsquo; amongst the sources of topics for <hi rend="italic">prooemia.</hi> Victorius defends him against this, by pointing out, as Cicero, that <foreign lang="greek">ὁ λέγων</foreign> includes <hi rend="italic">both parties</hi> in a suit or prosecution, <hi rend="italic">actor</hi> as well as <hi rend="italic">reus</hi> (in its ordinary sense). See the passage of Quint., with Spalding's note. </p>
						<p>&lsquo;The topics derivable from the speaker himself and the opponent, are all such as relate to allaying (<hi rend="italic">lit.</hi> &lsquo;refuting&rsquo;) and exciting prejudice and illfeeling (after <foreign lang="greek">ποιῆσαι</foreign> understand <foreign lang="greek">αὐτήν</foreign>): but with this difference: that in defending oneself all that relates to <foreign lang="greek">διαβολή</foreign> (i. e. the removal of prejudice and ill-will from ourselves, and exciting them against the opponent) must be put first (<hi rend="italic">subaudi</hi> <foreign lang="greek">λεκτέον</foreign>, viz. in the <hi rend="italic">exordium</hi>), but in the accusation of another reserved for the peroration. The reason of this is not difficult to see; that is, that the defendant, when he is about to introduce his own case, must necessarily begin by doing away with all hindrances (<hi rend="italic">sc.</hi> to the establishment of it; all prepossessions against him on the part of the judge); and therefore must make the removal or refutation of all calumnies or prejudices against him his first point; whereas the accuser (the speaker whose office it is to &lsquo;set&rsquo; the defendant &lsquo;against&rsquo; the judges, conciliate their ill-will to him) must reserve all that tends to prejudice his antagonist for the epilogue (peroration, conclusion), that they may better remember it&rsquo; (that his accusations may &lsquo;leave their sting behind them&rsquo; in the judges' minds). Both Spengel and Bekker write <foreign lang="greek">αὑτόν</foreign> after <foreign lang="greek">εͅἰκάζειν</foreign> for the <hi rend="italic">vulgata lectio</hi> <foreign lang="greek">αὐτόν</foreign>; which as far as appears to the contrary is the reading of all MSS. I think <foreign lang="greek">αὐτόν</foreign> for &lsquo;his own case&rsquo;, <hi rend="italic">lit.</hi> himself, is defensible. We often say &lsquo;him&rsquo; for &lsquo;himself&rsquo;, leaving the reflexive part to be understood, in our own language. See note on I 7. 35, and Waitz on Organ. 54 <hi rend="italic">a</hi> 14, Vol. I. p. 486, there referred to. </p>
						<p>&lsquo;The topics of the <foreign lang="greek">προοίμιον</foreign> which are addressed to the hearer (i. e. in the dicastic branch now under consideration, the judges,) are derived from (<hi rend="italic">subaudi</hi> <foreign lang="greek">γίγνεται</foreign>, or as before, <foreign lang="greek">λέγεται</foreign>) the conciliation of his good will (towards ourselves) and irritating him (exciting his indignation against the adversary, <foreign lang="greek">δείνωσις</foreign>), and <hi rend="italic">sometimes</hi> too (<foreign lang="greek">δέ</foreign>), (but only when it is required,) from engaging his attention or the reverse: for it is not always <pb n="171"/> expedient to make him attentive, and this is why many (speakers) try to move or provoke him to laughter&rsquo;. <foreign lang="greek">Προάγειν εἰς γέλωτα</foreign>&rsquo;, to move, or provoke to&rsquo;.

						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">εὔνουν ποιῆσαι</lemma>] &ldquo;The three requisites in the disposition of the audience, according to the later writers on the subject, are that they should be <hi rend="italic">benevoli, dociles, attenti.</hi> Cic. de Inv. 1 15. 20, Quint. IV 1. 5: and frequently elsewhere. Ar. includes the two latter under one head <foreign lang="greek">προσεκτικοί</foreign>: and in fact if a man is inclined to <hi rend="italic">attend</hi>, he shews that he is already inclined to or desirous of learning.

						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">οὐ γὰρ ἀεὶ συμφέρει κ.τ.λ.</lemma>] Cic. de Or. II 79. 323. He begins by saying that neither of these topics is to be <hi rend="italic">confined</hi> to the <hi rend="italic">prooemium</hi> &sect; 322, <hi rend="italic">nam et attentum monent Graeci ut principio faciamus iudicem et docilem</hi> (this is included in <foreign lang="greek">προσεκτικοί</foreign>); <hi rend="italic">quae sunt utilia, sed non principii magis propria quam reliquarum partium; faciliora etiam in principiis, quod et attenti tum maxime sunt, quum omnia exspectant, et dociles magis initiis esse possunt.</hi> Quint., IV 1. 37, 38, criticizes Aristotle's remark on this point: <hi rend="italic">Nec me quanquam magni auctores in hoc duxerint ut non semper facere attentum ac docilem iudicem velim: non quia nesciam, id quod ab illis dicitur, esse pro mala causa qualis ea sit non intelligi: verum quia istud non negligentia iudicis contingit, sed errore. Dixit enim adversarius, et fortasse persuasit: nobis opus est eius diversa opinione: quae mutari non potest nisi illum fecerimus ad ea quae dicemus docilem et attentum</hi>, seq. That is, the judge's inattention often arises not from negligence, but from a mistaken supposition that the adversary is right and we are wrong: in order to set him right we must rouse his attention. The supposition implied here in explanation of <foreign lang="greek">οὐκ ἀεὶ συμφ. κ.τ.λ.</foreign>, which Quint. refers to and criticizes, is that inattention on the judge's part is sometimes expedient when our cause is bad. Quint.'s reply is, it is not his <hi rend="italic">inattention</hi> that would be of use to us in such a case, but his <hi rend="italic">attention</hi> to the arguments which we are about to use in order to convince him to the contrary. Another disadvantage that may arise from over-attention on the judge's part, occurs when we want to slur over an unfavourable point in our case. In illustration of the following <foreign lang="greek">διὸ πολλοὶ κ.τ.λ.</foreign> Gaisford very appositely quotes Arist. Vesp. 564, <foreign lang="greek">Οί δὲ λέγουσιν μύθους ἡμῖν, οἱ δ’  Αἰσώπου τι γελοῖον· οἱ δὲ σκώπτους̓, ἵν̓</foreign> <pb n="172"/> <foreign lang="greek">ἐγὼ γελάσω, καὶ τὸν θυμὸν καταθῶμαι</foreign>. [Dem. Or. 54 (<foreign lang="greek">κατὰ Κόνωνος</foreign>) &sect;&sect; 13, 20, <foreign lang="greek">γελάσαντες ἀφήσετε</foreign>, and Or. 23 &sect; 206.] </p>
						<p>The Scholiast on this place (see in Spengel's Ed. p. 158), tells, <hi rend="italic">apropos</hi> of this, the story from Demosth. de Cor. &sect;&sect; 51, 52, with additions. The Scholiast, Ulpian on the passage of Dem., and a scholiast on Ar. Anal. Pr. 1 24 <hi rend="italic">b</hi> 20 (in Brandis' collection, Arist. Op. Bekker's 4to. vol. IV. p. 147 <hi rend="italic">b</hi> 43 of Bekker's quarto ed. of Aristotle), all agree that Demosthenes' <hi rend="italic">joke</hi> consisted in an intentional mispronunciation of the word <foreign lang="greek">μισθωτός</foreign>, which he applied to Aeschines, pronouncing it <foreign lang="greek">μίσθωτος</foreign>, in order to divert the attention of the audience: he appealed to them to say whether the word was not well applied: they burst into a roar of laughter, accepted the application, and shouted <foreign lang="greek">Αἰσχίνης μισθωτός, Αἰσχίνης μισθωτός</foreign>, with the pronunciation corrected. I entirely agree with Dissen that this is a foolish and improbable story, absurd in itself, and receiving no countenance from the <hi rend="italic">text of Demosthenes.</hi> All that he <hi rend="italic">did</hi> say is found in the existing text, viz. that he interpreted Aeschines' <foreign lang="greek">ξενίαν Ἀλεξάνδρου</foreign>&mdash;which Aesch. claimed&mdash;as meaning that he was not a <foreign lang="greek">ξένος</foreign>, a guest and friend, but a <foreign lang="greek">μισθωτὸς</foreign> (a hireling) <foreign lang="greek">Ἀλεξάνδρον</foreign> and nothing more, and that the people accepted this version. See Dissen's note on &sect; 52. </p>
						<p>(<foreign lang="greek">εὐμάθεια</foreign>, <hi rend="italic">docilitas</hi>, need not be made a <hi rend="italic">separate</hi> topic, because) &lsquo;any speaker may refer to this (carry back, i. e. apply) any thing he pleases (any of the topics of the <foreign lang="greek">προοίμιον</foreign>), even the appearance of worth and respectability; for to these (<foreign lang="greek">τοῖς ἐπιεικέσι</foreign>) the audience is always more inclined to attend&rsquo;. (This is in fact the <foreign lang="greek">ἀρετή</foreign> which the speaker must always assume <hi rend="italic">by his speech</hi>, in order that his hearers may have confidence in him, that he may have weight and <hi rend="italic">authority</hi> with them; one of the three ingredients in the <foreign lang="greek">ἦθος ἐν τῷ λέγοντι</foreign>, II 1. 5. Introd. on <foreign lang="greek">ἦθος</foreign>, p. 108 seq.) In short, <foreign lang="greek">εὐμάθεια</foreign> need not be made a <hi rend="italic">separate</hi> topic, provided only the speaker treats the other topics of the <foreign lang="greek">προοίμιον</foreign> with the view of making the audience <hi rend="italic">docilcs</hi>, that is, ready to receive the information which he is prepared to communicate to them. </p>
						<p>&lsquo;The things to which the audience is most <hi rend="italic">inclined</hi> to listen are things great (momentous, important), things of special interest (to the hearers themselves), things wonderful (surprising), and things pleasant (to hear; either in themselves, or in their associations); and therefore the speaker should always try to produce the impression (<foreign lang="greek">ἐν</foreign> in his hearers' minds) that things of such kinds are his subject. If he wish to make them inattentive (he must try to convey the impression, <foreign lang="greek">ἐὰν μή</foreign>, <hi rend="italic">subaudi</hi> <foreign lang="greek">ποιεῖν ἐθέλῃ τισπροσεκτικούς</foreign>) that his subject is trifling, has no reference to <hi rend="italic">them</hi> and their interests (that is, is unimportant in general, or to them in particular: the opposite of the <foreign lang="greek">τὰ ἴδια</foreign> in this preceding topic) or that it is unpleasant&rsquo;. <pb n="173"/> </p>
						<p>On interesting and uninteresting topics, see the parallel passages in Rhet. ad Alex. 29 (30). 3, where those of Aristotle are subdivided: Cic. de Inv. I 16. 23: Cic., Orat. Part. c. 8, expresses Ar.'s <foreign lang="greek">ἴδια</foreign>, <hi rend="italic">Coniuncta cum ipsis apud quos agetur.</hi> </p>

						<p>&lsquo;However it must not be forgotten that all such things as these (all these ordinary contents of the <foreign lang="greek">προοίμια</foreign>) are foreign to (outside; <hi rend="italic">extra</hi>, not <hi rend="italic">secundum, artem</hi>) the speech (and its real object, which is the <hi rend="italic">proof</hi> of the case, and that alone, <foreign lang="greek">αἱ δὲ πίστεις ἔντεχνόν ἐστι μόνον, τὰ δ’  ἄλλα προσθῆκαι</foreign>, I 1. 3): it is only because the audience is bad, and ready to listen to things beside the real question, (that these are addressed to them); for if he be not such, there is no occasion for an exordium (to flatter him into a good humour, and the rest), except just so far as to state the case in a summary way, that, like a body, it may have a head on it&rsquo;. There is probably a reference in this to <foreign lang="greek">σῶμα τῆς πίστεως</foreign>, as the enthymemes, or direct logical proofs, are called I 1. 3. </p>
						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">φαῦλος</lemma>, as applied to the audience or judges, means here not morally bad, but only defective in intellect and patience, too ignorant and frivolous to attend long to sound and serious reasoning: they require to be relieved and <hi rend="italic">diverted</hi> occasionally.

						<p>&lsquo;Besides, this making the hearers disposed to listen (keep up <pb n="174"/> their attention), is common to all the parts of the speech alike, wherever it is required: for they are more inclined to relax it anywhere rather than at the opening. It is absurd therefore to fix its place (&lsquo;post&rsquo; it) at the beginning, a time when everybody listens with the greatest attention&rsquo;. Cic. de Or. II 79. 323 quoted on &sect; 7, <foreign lang="greek">οὐ γὰρ &lt;&gt;̓εὶ συμφέρει</foreign>. Also Quint. IV. 1. 73, who follows Arist. in quoting Prodicus' artifice. &lsquo;And therefore, (not only at the beginning, but) wherever there is occasion, such phrases as this must be used, &ldquo;And now attend to what I say, for it is no more my affair than yours&rdquo;; or, &ldquo;I'll tell such a strange thing&mdash;or a thing so marvellous&mdash;as you have never yet heard before.&rdquo; And this is like what Prodicus said, &ldquo;whenever his audience were inclined to be drowsy, he would slip them in a taste of the fifty drachm&rdquo;&rsquo;.  <foreign lang="greek">παρεμβάλλειν</foreign>, throw them in by the side of the rest, on the sly, (<foreign lang="greek">παραδιηγεῖσθαι</foreign>, <hi rend="italic">infra</hi> 16.5).

						<p>&lsquo;But (that all this is beside the point, and <hi rend="italic">extra artem;</hi>) that it is not addressed to the hearer as a hearer (read by all means <foreign lang="greek">ᾗ ἀκροατής</foreign> sc. <foreign lang="greek">ἐστι</foreign>: i. e., that it is addressed to him as a hearer and something more, as a man liable to all the defects and infirmities and feelings above mentioned) &lsquo;is plain: for speakers invariably employ their exordia either in prejudicing (the audience against the adversary), or in the endeavour to remove similar apprehensions (of the like suspicions and prejudices) from themselves&rsquo;. If the audience were mere impartial listeners, met there to hear and judge the case, <hi rend="italic">and nothing more;</hi> there would be no occasion for all this accusation and defence with which the orators always fill their <hi rend="italic">prooemia.</hi> </p>
						<p>The first example referred to, the excuse of the <foreign lang="greek">φύλαξ</foreign> for his lack of speed and his unwelcome message, Soph. Antig. 223 seq., is a case <pb n="175"/> of <foreign lang="greek">ἀπολογεῖσθαι φόβους</foreign>, &lsquo;to remove the threatened danger, or postpone it as long as he can, by a defence&rsquo;: and the application is, that if he had not been <hi rend="italic">afraid</hi> of Creon, if he had been quite sure that Creon was an altogether impartial hearer, he would not have indulged in such a long preface. The second is an example of the same kind from Eur. Iph. Taur. 1162, Thoas to Iphigenia, <foreign lang="greek">τί φροιμιάζει νεοχμόν; ἐξαύδα σαφῶς</foreign>. The actual defence is confined to one line (1161), but Thoas suspects her of entering upon a long apology. Buhle, who could not have looked at the passage, says &ldquo;Iphig. longo exordio utentem.&rdquo; The Scholiast (Spengel's Ed. p. 161) here gives a long paraphrase of the watchman's speech. After this, incredible as it may appear, he adds <foreign lang="greek">τὸ δὲ τί φροιμιάζῃ τοῦ Κρέοντός ἐστι λέγοντος</foreign>, as if this had been a continuation of the line from the Antigone. </p>
						<p>&lsquo;And those who have, or suppose themselves to have, a bad case (<hi rend="italic">lit.</hi> their case bad) are apt to indulge in long prooemia: for it is better for them to dwell upon anything rather than upon their case&rsquo;.&mdash;This also is illustrated by the speech of the <foreign lang="greek">φύλαξ</foreign> in the Antigone: and perhaps was suggested by it; for it is not very consecutive&mdash;&lsquo;And this is why slaves (when charged with a fault, and excusing themselves to their masters) never answer the questions directly, but (state) the attending (<hi rend="italic">surrounding</hi>) <hi rend="italic">circum</hi>stances, and make a long (roundabout) preface (before they come to the point)&rsquo;. On <foreign lang="greek">τὰ κύκλῳ</foreign> see 19. 33. Victorius quotes Virg. Georg. II 45, <hi rend="italic">Non hic te carmine ficto Atque per ambages et longa exorsa tencbo.</hi> </p>

						<p>&lsquo;The <hi rend="italic">exordia</hi> of the public oration are borrowed from those of the forensic speech, but are naturally very rare in it: for in fact the subject of it is one with which they are already well acquainted, and therefore the facts of the case require no preface (no preparatory explanation) except&mdash;if at all&mdash;on his own account or that of the adversary (<foreign lang="greek">δἰ αὐτόν</foreign> to put himself right with the audience, the <foreign lang="greek">ἦθος ἐν τῷ λέγοντι; ἢ τοὺς ἀντιλέγοντας</foreign> to meet the adversary's charges, combat the prejudices the other has raised against him: both of these therefore are <hi rend="italic">accidental</hi>), or in case the subject (this is <hi rend="italic">essential</hi>) is not considered by them of the precise degree of importance which you wish, but rated either too high or too low.&rsquo; As to <foreign lang="greek">τοὺς ἀντιλέγοντας</foreign>, we had been told before, c. 13. 3, <foreign lang="greek">προοίμιον δὲ...ἐν ταῖς δημηγορίαις τότε γίνεται ὅταν ἀντιλογία ἦ</foreign>: as in Demosth. de Corona, and de Falsa Legatione.

						<p>&lsquo;These are the circumstances in which a preface is required (<foreign lang="greek">δεῖται, ὁ λόγος</foreign>, or <foreign lang="greek">ὁ λέγων</foreign>); either these, or for mere ornament's sake, because, without it, the speech has an off-hand, slovenly (impromptu, extemporaneous) air (note on III 7. 1). For such is Gorgias' encomium on the Eleans; without any preliminary sparring (flourish) or preparatory stirring up he starts abruptly (rushes <hi rend="italic">at once, in medias res; without</hi> any previous warning or preparation) with &ldquo;Elis, blessed city.&rdquo; </p>

This is illustrated by Plato, Legg.

					<p>The following chapter is a continuation of the preceding on the ordinary contents of the <foreign lang="greek">προοίμιον</foreign>, two of which, as we have seen c. 14 &sect; 12, are <foreign lang="greek">διαβάλλειν</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">ἀπολύεσθαι</foreign>: and on these two the orator is supplied with topics. </p>
					<p>The same subject is treated in the Rhet. ad Alex. c. 29 (30), at even greater length than by Aristotle: and a summary of its contents, with some remarks on its moral character, and its connexion with Isocrates, may be found in Introd. pp. 441&mdash;443. A comparison of this with Aristotle's treatment of the subject is altogether in favour of the latter. He had already told us that he disapproves of the <foreign lang="greek">προοίμιον</foreign>, as distinct from the <foreign lang="greek">πρόθεσις</foreign>, altogether: but he is obliged, by the practice of his predecessors, and the evident importance of the subject, which in spite of its unscientific character cannot be altogether passed over in a complete treatise on Rhetoric, to give it a place in his system; but it will be observed that in dealing with it he occupies at least threefourths of the chapter with the topics of the <hi rend="italic">defensive</hi> use of it, confining his observations on the aggressive side to two topics in a single section. See also especially &sect; 10, <foreign lang="greek">τοιοῦτοι δὲ οἱ τεχνικώτατοι κ.τ.λ.</foreign> The reckless and unscrupulous precepts of the other treatise present <foreign lang="greek">διαβολή</foreign> in its very worst character: it is truly here the &lsquo;devil's art&rsquo;, <foreign lang="greek">ἡ τοῦ διαβόλου τέχνη</foreign>, the art of insinuating by whatever means prejudice and ill-will against your opponent&mdash;merely because he happens to be such, and for no other reason&mdash;and so <hi rend="italic">prejudicing his case.</hi> There is something further on this in c. 36 (37). 46, 47. There is an invective against <foreign lang="greek">διαβολή</foreign> in Isocr. <foreign lang="greek">ἀντίδ</foreign>. &sect; 18. &ldquo;<foreign lang="greek">διαβάλλειν</foreign> is &lsquo;to set at variance&rsquo;, &lsquo;to make hostile&rsquo;; and so to inspire ill-will, insinuate suspicions, or prejudice a person against another. It applies as a technical term to all insinuations and accusations by which one of the parties in a case endeavours to raise a prejudice against the other, which are to be reflected upon, but do not directly help to prove, the main charge or point at issue; and are therefore <hi rend="italic">extra artem</hi>, <foreign lang="greek">ἔξω τοῦ πράγματος</foreign>. See III 15. 9; and comp. the example, <hi rend="italic">infra</hi> &sect; 3. <foreign lang="greek">ἀπολύεσθαι</foreign> is to clear oneself of such insinuated charges, to remove evil suspicions. Aristotle begins with this, because, as he told us before (c. 14. 7), it is <hi rend="italic">more</hi> appropriate to the exordium, as the opposite (in accusation) is to the peroration.&rdquo; Introd. p. 344. <pb n="179"/> </p>

						<p>&lsquo;With respect to <foreign lang="greek">διαβολή</foreign>, (intentional and malicious) calumny or (accidental, undesigned) prejudice, one (the first) topic is <hi rend="italic">anything</hi> from which arguments may be derived for removing offensive (unpleasant, injurious) <hi rend="italic">suspicion:</hi> for it makes no difference whether (the charge or insinuation) has been actually spoken (expressed, in the shape of a direct <hi rend="italic">personal calumny</hi>) or not&rsquo; (i.e. has merely been conceived, not openly stated; <foreign lang="greek">ὑπόληψις</foreign> as a mere conception or supposition&mdash;against us by inference, from our words, actions, or manners, or altogether accidentally, when people have a <hi rend="italic">bad opinion</hi> of us: in either case the prejudice requires to be removed); &lsquo;and therefore this is a general rule&rsquo;; includes everything, every kind of argument which tends to remove any bad opinion or prejudice which for whatever reason may be entertained against us: and this, whether the charge we have to meet be a direct statement, or merely an uncertified suspicion. This is illustrated by Rhet. ad Alex. 29 (30). 8, 9. </p>

						<p>&lsquo;Another way (of clearing oneself) is to meet the charge on any of these <hi rend="italic">issues</hi>&rsquo; (<foreign lang="greek">στάσεις</foreign> or <foreign lang="greek">ἀμφισβητήσεις</foreign>, <hi rend="italic">status</hi>, the turning-point of the case, on which issue is joined: on these see Appendix E to Book III in Introd. p. 397 seq. where the various classifications of them are given;) &lsquo;either by denying the fact (<foreign lang="greek">τὸ ὅτι</foreign>, <hi rend="italic">status coniecturalis</hi>); or admitting that, and asserting that the alleged act was not injurious (<hi rend="italic">ab utili</hi>, Victorius); or at any rate not to <hi rend="italic">him</hi> (the complainant); or that the amount of injury is overstated; or that it was either no wrong at all (not <hi rend="italic">unjust:</hi> not a legal crime), or a slight one; or, (taking the other view of morality, supposing it to be strictly speaking unjust, at any rate) not disgraceful, or a mere trifle, of no importance at all&rsquo;. <foreign lang="greek">οὐ μέγα</foreign> differs in this from <foreign lang="greek">οὐκ ἔχον μέγεθος</foreign>: the former qualifies merely the <hi rend="italic">wrong</hi> of the <foreign lang="greek">ἄδικον</foreign>, the latter is &ldquo;no great matter&rdquo;; of <hi rend="italic">greatness</hi>, in the sense of magnitude or importance in general. &lsquo;For these are the points upon which the issue (of a case) turns, as in that between Iphicrates and Nausicrates: for he admitted the <hi rend="italic">fact</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">injury</hi>, but said it was no <hi rend="italic">wrong</hi>&rsquo;. Nausicrates or (always in the Latin Rhetoricians) Naucrates, is mentioned by Cicero, Orat. L 172, de Orat. II 23. 94, and III 44. 173, as a pupil of Isocrates.

						<p>&lsquo;Or (in justifying oneself), admitting a wrong done, to balance (or compensate) it (by something else which may be taken as a set-off, or drawback, in diminution of the wrong); for instance you say, what I did was injurious no doubt, but honourable; or painful, but serviceable; or anything else of the same sort&rsquo;.

						<p>&lsquo;Another method is (to extenuate the <foreign lang="greek">ἀδίκημα</foreign> by the milder <pb n="181"/> terms), (to say) that it is a mistake, or an accident, or compulsory&rsquo;, done under compulsion: <foreign lang="greek">βίᾳ</foreign>, see I 10. 14, and Appendix C to Bk. I., Introd. p. 225, and the references there. <foreign lang="greek">ἀνάγκη</foreign> or <foreign lang="greek">βία</foreign>, &lsquo;overpowering force&rsquo;, <hi rend="italic">forza maggiore, force majeure</hi>, absolves from responsibility. Four <hi rend="italic">degrees of criminality</hi> are thus distinguished in Eth. Nic. V 10, 1135 <hi rend="italic">b</hi> 11, (1) <foreign lang="greek">ἀτύχημα</foreign>, a mere accident, an injury done unintentionally without knowledge of the <hi rend="italic">special circumstances</hi> of the case: (2) <foreign lang="greek">ἁμάρτημα</foreign>, an error or mistake, where the act is intentional but the injury unintentional (the case of killing a friend with a gun supposed not to be loaded); this does not include the case of moral ignorance, ignorance of right and wrong, for which a man <hi rend="italic">is</hi> responsible: (3) <foreign lang="greek">ἀδίκημα</foreign>, a wrong, intentional in a sense, but without <hi rend="italic">deliberation</hi> or <hi rend="italic">malice prepense</hi>, as a deadly blow dealt in a fit of passion, when the judgment is for the moment overpowered; (this is, I believe, the only place in which this degree is distinguished from the following: at all events the <hi rend="italic">ordinary</hi> division is threefold.) All these are short of actual guilt or crime. The last stage, of actual crime, is (4) <foreign lang="greek">ἀδικία</foreign>, a wrong act committed with full knowledge of the circumstances, and deliberate purpose, <foreign lang="greek">ὅταν ἐκ προαιρέσεως ἄδικος καὶ μοχθηρός</foreign>. With this compare III 2, on the intentional and unintentional. Comp. also Rhet. ad Alex. 4 (5). 8, 9. </p>
						<p>&lsquo;As for instance Sophocles said that his trembling was not, as his accuser (or traducer) said, assumed to convey the appearance of old age, (and thereby obtain the sympathy and compassion of the judges) but compulsory (and therefore he was not responsible for it); for his eighty years were quite unintentional&rsquo;. On Sophocles&mdash;not the poet&mdash;see note on I 14. 3. The same Sophocles is mentioned again III 18. 6. </p>
						<p>&lsquo;And again, by a balance (compensatory interchange or substitution) of motives; (for instance) that you had no intention of injuring him; what you really intended to do was so and so, and not that which was falsely laid to your charge; the <hi rend="italic">injury</hi> was an accident (not <hi rend="italic">of the essence</hi> of what you did: a mere <foreign lang="greek">συμβεβηκός</foreign>). &ldquo;I should deserve to be hated if that were my intention in doing it&rdquo;&rsquo;.

						<p>&lsquo;Another (way or topic) is <hi rend="italic">recrimination</hi>, when the accuser is involved in the same charge, either at the present time or on some previous occasion; either himself or any of those <hi rend="italic">near</hi> to him (relatives, connexions, intimate friends)&rsquo;. If you can shew that your adversary or any one very near to him is liable to the same charge as that of <pb n="182"/> which he accuses you, though the charge may not therefore fall to the ground, at any rate you can silence him by saying, that <hi rend="italic">he</hi> at all events was not the person to make it. Majoragius cites Cic. pro Ligar. &sect; 2. <hi rend="italic">Habes igitur, Tubero, quod est accusatori maxime optandum, confitentem reum, sed tamen ita confitentem, se in ea parte fuisse, qua te, Tubero, qua virum omni laude dignum, patrem tuum.

					<div3 id="b3c15s5" type="section" n="5">
						<p>&lsquo;Again, if others are included in the charge who are admitted not to be liable to the accusation; for instance if (it be argued) that so and so is an adulterer because he is a smart dresser, (the reply is) why in that case so must Smith and Jones be adulterers'&mdash;although it is perfectly well known that Smith and Jones are entirely free from that vice. Bekker and Spengel accept Riccoboni's, and Bekker's own, suggestion <foreign lang="greek">καθάριος</foreign> for <hi rend="italic">vulgata lectio</hi> <foreign lang="greek">καθαρός</foreign>: but they retain the article <foreign lang="greek">ὁ</foreign> in its old position <foreign lang="greek">ὅτι καθάριος ὁ μοιχός</foreign>. With this reading the only translation can be, &ldquo;that all adulterers dress smartly&rdquo;, which is not to the point. The <hi rend="italic">converse</hi> is required by the <hi rend="italic">argument</hi>&mdash;which is, to free yourself from a suspicion which has arisen from some accidental association, by shewing that, if the two things were really associated, others would be liable to the same suspicion, who are known <hi rend="italic">not</hi> to be obnoxious to it: &ldquo;if, as is alleged, all smart dressers were adulterers, then so and so, who are known <hi rend="italic">not</hi> to be liable to the charge, would be involved in it&rdquo;: and besides this, the following passages on the same subject shew that this <hi rend="italic">was</hi> the argument that was used. <foreign lang="greek">καθάριος</foreign>, II 4. 15, for &lsquo;neatness and cleanliness in dress&rsquo; and attention to personal appearance: the <hi rend="italic">argument</hi> from this appears II 24. 7, <foreign lang="greek">ἐπεὶ καλλωπιστής, καὶ νύκτωρ πλανᾶται, μοιχός· τοιοῦτοι γὰρ</foreign>; and de Soph.

It is necessary therefore, besides the alteration of <foreign lang="greek">καθαρός</foreign> into <foreign lang="greek">καθάριος</foreign>, either to change the position of the article, <foreign lang="greek">εἰ ὅτι ὁ καθάριος μοιχός</foreign> or to omit the article altogether <foreign lang="greek">εἰ ὅτι καθάριος μοιχός</foreign>.

						<p>&lsquo;Another is, the appeal to a previous decision; an instance of which is Euripides&rsquo; reply to Hygiaenon, in the <hi rend="italic">exchange</hi> case, in which the latter accused him of impiety for the verse that he wrote in recommendation of perjury, &ldquo;the tongue hath sworn; but the mind is unsworn&rdquo;. His reply was that the other had no right to bring cases (decisions) out of the Dionysiac contest into the courts of law: for he had already given an account (stood his trial) of them (his words, <foreign lang="greek">αὐτῶν</foreign>, included in the verse), or was prepared to do so, if the other chose to accuse him&rsquo;. This celebrated verse, Hippol. 608, probably owes a good deal of its notoriety to Aristophanes' parody of it near the end of the Frogs. Seldom has so &ldquo;much ado about nothing&rdquo; been made as about this unlucky line. The charge of recommending perjury is at any rate a gross exaggeration. Nor does it <hi rend="italic">necessarily</hi> imply even mental reservation. Cicero, de Off. III 29. 107 (quoted by Monk ad loc.), puts the case very clearly. <hi rend="italic">Quod ita iuratum est ut</hi> mens conciperet fieri oportere, <hi rend="italic">id servandum est: quod aliter, id si non feceris nullum est periurium. Non enim falsum iurare periurare est; sed quod ex animi tui sententia iuraris, sicut verbis concipitur more nostro, id non facere periurium est. Scite enim Euripides</hi>, Iuravi lingua, mentem iniuratam gero. See the whole of Monk's note. Paley in <hi rend="italic">his</hi> note follows Cicero. Of course the deceit, if there be any, lies in the intention and not in the word; and this is all that Hippolytus seems to say. He never intended that his oath should be kept in <hi rend="italic">that</hi> sense: and his ignorance of the circumstances absolves him from the responsibility, or obligation of the oath. See above in note on &sect; 3<note anchored="yes">I find this note in one of my copies of the Hippolytus. &ldquo;I don't think the principle implied in this (the verse of Eurip.) can be defended. Hippolytus says that he swore to keep the secret in ignorance of the nature of it: now that he knows <hi rend="italic">that</hi>, he is freed from the obligation of keeping it. Has a man a <hi rend="italic">right</hi> to lay himself under an obligation, of the nature of which he is ignorant?&rdquo; However the question still remains, if the oath <hi rend="italic">has been</hi> taken in ignorance, is he still bound to keep it? The last sentence was added when this Commentary was written.</note>. </p>
						<p>We learn from this passage that Euripides (the tragic poet) was <pb n="184"/> capable of pleading a cause in public. Another public speech, in an embassy to Syracuse, is attributed to him in II 6. 20 ult., where see note. </p>

Aen. VIII 157, <hi rend="italic">Nam memini Hesiones visentem regna sororis Laomedontiadem Priamum</hi> seq.; and Soph.

But as the interpretation of this passage is perfectly clear, and his hypothesis altogether the reverse, uncertain in every particular, there is little doubt which of the two is to be preferred for the elucidation of Ar.'s text&mdash;provided we confess our entire ignorance of all else in and about the play in question. </p>

						<p>Something is here lost. &lsquo;But as it is, it is absurd to say&rsquo; (as the writers on Rhetoric do in their treatises; and especially Isocrates) &lsquo;that the narration ought to be rapid&rsquo;. This precept is <hi rend="italic">suggested</hi> in Rhet. ad Alex. 6 (7). 3, in the word <foreign lang="greek">βραχυλογία</foreign>; and 30 (31). 4, it is further recommended that the narrative of a <foreign lang="greek">δημηγορία</foreign> should be <foreign lang="greek">βραχεῖα</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">σύντομος</foreign>. See Spengel's note on ed. of Anaximenes' Ars Rhet., pp. 214, 5: and 219. Cic. de Orat. II 80. 326. Quint.

The precept, that it should be <foreign lang="greek">σύντομον</foreign>, is found also in Dionysius de Lys. Iud. c. 18, (p. 492 R): probably taken from Isocrates.

						<p>The extract from <hi rend="italic">Isocrates</hi>, on this quality of the <foreign lang="greek">διήγησις</foreign>, is quoted at the commencement of this chapter.

The <foreign lang="greek">Ἀλκίνου ἀπόλογος</foreign>, in its original form, when given at length with all its details, became proverbial for &ldquo;a long story.&rdquo; Erasmus <hi rend="italic">Chil.</hi> <foreign lang="greek">Ἀπόλογος Ἀλκίνου ἐπὶ τῶν φλυαρούντων καὶ μακρὸν ἀποτεινόντων λόγον</foreign>, Suidas s.v. Plato, Rep. X 614 B, uses it in the same proverbial application. See Ast and Stallbaum <hi rend="italic">ad locum.</hi> The <foreign lang="greek">Ἀλκίνου ἀπόλογος</foreign> appears in Aelian's list of <foreign lang="greek">ῥαψῳδίαι</foreign> into which the Homeric poems were divided for recitation (Var. Hist. XIII 13, <foreign lang="greek">π. Ὁμήρον ἐπῶν καὶ ποιήσεως</foreign>, quoted by Paley, Pref. to Hom. Il. p. xlvii). It is quoted again to supply an instance of <foreign lang="greek">ἀναγνώρισις</foreign>, Poet. XVI. </p>
						<p>Of Phayllus nothing whatever is known. It seems that this is the <pb n="192"/> only place in which his name occurs; neither is it to be found in Smith's <hi rend="italic">Biogr. Dict.</hi> We gather from the notice of him here, that whether poet or rhapsodist, he attempted to reduce the whole of the Epic Cycle into a brief summary. F. A. Wolf is so staggered by the overwhelming labour of such a task that he prefers to read <foreign lang="greek">Κύκλωπα</foreign>, from a correction in one of the MSS; overlooking the fact that <foreign lang="greek">τὸν Κύκλωπα</foreign> is <hi rend="italic">not</hi> in point here; <foreign lang="greek">τὸν κύκλον</foreign>, which gives a second instance of a summary, is. </p>
						<p>The third example is the prologue to Euripides' Oeneus. Four lines and a half of this are to be found in Wagner's collection, <hi rend="italic">Fragm. Eurip.</hi> p. 290, Oen. Fr. 1. and Dindorf, Eur. Fr. Oeneus. They are written with Euripidean compactness, and seem to justify their citation for this purpose. </p>

						<p>&lsquo;The narrative should have an ethical cast: this will be effected when (if) we know what imparts this ethical character. One thing in particular that does so, is any indication of a moral purpose (II 21. 16, III 17. 9, Poet. VI 24): it is by (the quality of) this that a moral quality is given to character: and the quality (good or bad) of the moral purpose is determined by the end&rsquo;. On <foreign lang="greek">προαίρεσις</foreign>, see Eth. Nic. III cc. 4, 5, VI 2. &lsquo;Consequently Mathematics (mathematical calculations or reasonings, <foreign lang="greek">λόγοι</foreign>) can have no moral character, because they have no moral purpose: for they have no (moral or practical) end in view&rsquo;. (<hi rend="italic">Their</hi> end is the intellectual one, <hi rend="italic">truth.</hi>) &lsquo;But the &ldquo;Socratic dialogues&rdquo; have (a moral purpose, and an ethical and practical end), for they treat of such (ethical) subjects&rsquo;. On this class of works, called collectively &lsquo;Socratic dialogues&rsquo;, see Grote, <hi rend="italic">Plato</hi> III 469; also Heitz, <hi rend="italic">Verl. Schrift. Ar., die dial. des Arist.</hi> pp. 140&mdash;144. By &lsquo;Socratic dialogues&rsquo; are meant dialogues on moral philosophy, after the manner of Socrates, and therefore bearing his name, whether (as in Plato and Xenophon) he was an interlocutor, or not; the compositions of Socrates' friends and followers, the Socratic &lsquo;family&rsquo;, Xenophon, Plato, Aeschines, Antisthenes, Phaedo, (<hi rend="italic">Socraticam domum</hi>, Hor.

						<p>&lsquo;Another, different, kind of ethical drawing or representation (<foreign lang="greek">ἄλλα</foreign>; no longer confined to <hi rend="italic">moral</hi> qualities, but the representation of <hi rend="italic">character</hi> in general) are the characteristic peculiarities that accompany each individual character: for instance, &ldquo;so and so walked on as he was talking&rdquo;&mdash;an indication of audacity and rudeness of character&rsquo;. The rudeness and insolence are shewn in <hi rend="italic">not stopping</hi> to speak to the other; it is a sign of slight esteem and contempt, <foreign lang="greek">ὀλιγωρία</foreign>. The characters here spoken of differ in one point from the dramatic characters of III 7. 6,&mdash; though they belong to the same family, the <hi rend="italic">third</hi> kind of <foreign lang="greek">ἤθη</foreign>, Introd. p. 112&mdash;in that these are the characteristic peculiarities of <hi rend="italic">individuals</hi>, the others those of <hi rend="italic">classes.</hi> A good specimen of this <hi rend="italic">ethical</hi> description occurs in Demosth. de F. L. &sect; 361, a portrait of Aeschines; and two similar traits in c. Steph. <foreign lang="greek">ά  63, οὗτος γὰρ, ἡνίκα μὲν συνέβαινεν εὐτυχεῖν Ἀριστολόχῳ τῷ τραπεζίτῃ, ἴσα βαίνων ἐβάδιζεν ὑποπεπτωκὼς αὐτῷ...ἐπειδὴ δ’  ἀπώλετ̓ ἐκεῖνος κ.τ.λ.</foreign> and &sect; 77, <foreign lang="greek">ἐγὼ δ’  ...τῆς μὲν ὄψεως τῇ φύσει καὶ τῷ ταχέως βαδίζειν καὶ λαλεῖν μέγα</foreign> (signs apparently of ill-breeding) <foreign lang="greek">οὐ τῶν εὐτυχῶς πεφυκότων ἐμαυτὸν κρίνω</foreign>. The <foreign lang="greek">ἴσα βαίνειν</foreign> in the former passage, is &lsquo;to keep pace with&rsquo;, &lsquo;to walk on a level&rsquo;, &lsquo;place oneself on equal terms with&rsquo; another. See Shilleto ad loc. de F. L. (His reference to the passage of c. Steph. should be &sect; 63, not 77.) </p>
						<p>&lsquo;And again, in speaking, let your words seem to proceed, not from the intellect (as the effect of calculation, deliberation), but as it were from a moral purpose or intention (the will; or, as we should say, the heart)&rsquo;. &ldquo;Let your style bear the impress, not so much of intellectual subtlety and vigour, as of good feeling and sound moral purpose: the one may be the mark of a wise man, the other is that of a good&mdash;and, what is more to the purpose in Rhetoric, a popular&mdash;character.&rdquo; Introd. (slightly altered). &lsquo;&ldquo;And I wished this to take place; in fact such was my purpose and intention: it is true that I gained nothing by it; but even so it is better.&rdquo; The one is characteristic of a wise or prudent man, the other of a good one: for prudence (worldly, practical, wisdom) shews itself in the pursuit of one's interest, goodness in that of the fair, high, noble, right&rsquo;. </p>
						<p>&lsquo;If any (trait of character that you introduce) seem incredible, then add the statement (or explanation) of the cause or reason, as (in) the example that Sophocles gives, the passage of (from) his Antigone &ldquo;that <pb n="194"/> she cared more for her brother than for husband or children, for the one could be replaced (recovered) if they were lost&mdash;but when father and mother are buried in the grave, no brother can spring up evermore&rdquo;&rsquo;. This is Antigone's reason for preferring the burial of her brother's body to marriage with Haemon, a husband and children: she has shewn her character in the preference, and the obstinacy in which she adheres to it. It is the conclusion of a beautiful passage, beginning, <foreign lang="greek">ὦ τύμβος, ὦ νυμφεῖον</foreign>, Antig. 891&mdash;912. Arist. has altered <foreign lang="greek">κεκευθότων</foreign> of the original to <foreign lang="greek">βεβηκότων</foreign>. </p>
						<p>The same answer is put into the mouth of the wife of Intaphernes, when Darius, having condemned her husband and the whole of his family to death, allows her to choose one of the number whose life is to be spared. She chooses her brother, and when Darius expresses his surprise and demands the reason, replies thus: <foreign lang="greek">Ὦ βασιλεῦ, ἀνὴρ μέν μοι ἂν ἄλλος γένοιτο, εἰ δαίμων ἐθέλοι, καὶ τέκνα ἄλλα, εἰ ταῦτα ἀποβάλοιμι· πατρὸς δὲ καὶ μητρὸς οὐκ ἔτι μευ ζωόντων, ἀδελφεὸς ἂν ἄλλος οὐδενὶ τρόπῳ γένοιτο. ταύτῃ τῇ γνώμῃ χρεωμένη ἔλεξα ταῦτα</foreign>. The comparison of these two passages of the poet and historian, and another equally close correspondence of Herod. II 35 with Soph. Oed. Col. 337, have led to the inference that there was some connexion or acquaintance between the two. When or where they met, if they ever did meet, cannot now be ascertained: Samos (which has been suggested) is out of the question; for Herodotus was at Thurium before Sophocles was appointed to his command in the expedition under Pericles against that island. The Antigone was produced in 440 B.C. It is probable that some parts of Herodotus' history had been published<note anchored="yes">There is a doubtful story of a recitation at Olympia.</note> before the final completion of the work at Thurium, and Sophocles may have thus obtained access to them. That he was the borrower, there can be no reasonable doubt. At all events that Sophocles was an admirer of Herodotus we know from Plutarch, who gives us the first line and a half of an epigram by Sophocles in his honour; <foreign lang="greek">ᾠδὴν Ἡροδότῳ τεῦξεν Σοφοκλῆς ἐτέων ὢν πέντ’  ἐπὶ πεντήκοντα</foreign>; adding that it was <foreign lang="greek">ὁμολογουμένως Σοφοκλέους</foreign>. </p>
						<p>&lsquo;If you <hi rend="italic">have</hi> no reason to give, <hi rend="italic">at any rate</hi> you may say that &ldquo;you know that what you say will convince nobody, but such is your nature (you can't help being virtuous and disinterested, do what you will)&mdash;for <pb n="195"/> people never believe in disinterested motives<note anchored="yes">Comp. Rhet. ad Al. 7 (8). 10, <foreign lang="greek">πειρῶ δὲ ἀποφαίνειν καὶ ὡς λυσιτελὲς ἦν αὐτῷ ταῦτα ποιεῖν· οἱ γὰρ πλεῖστοι τῶν ἀνθρώπων αὐτοὶ τὸ λυσιτελὲς μάλιστα προτιμῶντες καὶ τοὺς ἄλλους νομίζουσιν ἕνεκα τούτου πάντα πράττειν</foreign>.</note>&rsquo;.

						<p>&lsquo;Further, besides the <foreign lang="greek">ἦθος</foreign>, topics may be also derived from the expression of emotion of various kinds, by introducing in your narration both the usual accompaniments of these emotions (the outward expressions, attitudes, and other external indications), which everybody is acquainted with, and also any <hi rend="italic">special</hi> peculiarities by which you yourself or the adversary may be distinguished (which may be attached to, belong to, <foreign lang="greek">προσόντα</foreign>)&rsquo;. These special touches and traits in the expression of individual emotion will lend a lifelike character to the descriptions of your narrative, and impart fidelity to your own impersonations of feelings, and your representation of them as they manifest themselves in others. How true and lifelike all that is, the audience will say: that can be no counterfeit: the man is evidently in earnest. Again, the same popular fallacy as before; the illicit inference from the faithfulness of the imitation to the sincerity of the feeling and truth of the fact. </p>
						<p>&lsquo;Such indications are &ldquo;and he went away with a scowl at me from under his eyebrows&rdquo; (so <foreign lang="greek">ταυρηδὸν ὑποβλέψας</foreign> of &lsquo;an angry glance&rsquo;, Pl. Phaed. 117 B; three other examples in Ast's Lex., where it is joined in the same sense with <foreign lang="greek">ὡς καταφρονοῦντα</foreign>, Symp. 220 B, <foreign lang="greek">ὥσπερ τι ἀδικούμενος</foreign>, Eryx. 395 A, <foreign lang="greek">ὑποβλέψονται σε διαφθορέα ἡγούμενοι</foreign>, Crit. 53 B. <foreign lang="greek">ὑπό</foreign> represents an &lsquo;under-look&rsquo;. Comp. the Homeric <foreign lang="greek">ὕποδρα ἰδών</foreign>): &lsquo;and as Aeschines says of Cratylus &ldquo;furiously hissing and shaking his fists&rdquo;&rsquo; (<foreign lang="greek">διά</foreign> in both participles is intensive, &lsquo;thorough, thoroughly&rsquo;; here &lsquo;violently&rsquo;: Aeschines and Cratylus are supposed by Victorius to be, the one Socrates' intimate, the other Plato's instructor in the Heraclitean philosophy, and the Eponymus of one of his dialogues: but nobody really knows): &lsquo;these are persuasive, because these things (indications of passion) which they <hi rend="italic">do</hi> know are made (by the speaker) signs or tokens of those that they <hi rend="italic">don't</hi> know (in the manner above explained). A great number of these (indications of <pb n="196"/> feeling) may be obtained from Homer: &ldquo;Thus then he spake; and the aged dame (Euryclea, Ulysses' old nurse) held fast (clasped) her face with her hands&rdquo; (Hom. Od. <foreign lang="greek">τ́</foreign> [XIX] 361)&mdash;for people, when they are beginning to cry, are apt to lay hold of their eyes. Introduce yourself at once (to the audience) in a particular character (in that, namely, which you wish to bear in their eyes) that they may regard you as such: and the adversary in the same way (<hi rend="italic">mutatis mutandis</hi>): only take care that the design isn't detected. That there is no difficulty in this&mdash;in conveying these impressions to the audience, how readily they seize, and draw inferences from, these indications of emotion, expression of features, action and the like&mdash;must needs be seen&rsquo; (retaining <foreign lang="greek">δεῖ</foreign> with Bekker, Spengel omits it) &lsquo;from the case of messengers: of things that we know nothing whatever about, we nevertheless (instantly) conceive a notion or suspicion&rsquo; (from the face, expression, gestures, general appearance of the messenger; as if he is hot and tired, and so on). </p>
						<p><hi rend="italic">See what a ready tongue suspicion hath! He that but fears the thing he would not know, hath by instinct knowledge from others' eyes, that what he feared is chanced.</hi> Northumb. <hi rend="italic">Henry IV.</hi> Act I, Sc. I, 84. Victorius refers to Soph. Trach. 869 (Dind.) as an instance of this, the suspicions of the Chorus gathered from the old woman's face. </p>
						<p>&lsquo;The narrative should be (not confined to one place and continuous, but) distributed over the speech (<foreign lang="greek">πολλαχοῦ</foreign> &lsquo;in many places&rsquo;), and sometimes not at the beginning&rsquo;. In saying <foreign lang="greek">οὐκ ἐν ἀρχῇ</foreign>, Ar. is referring to his own division of the speech, which excludes the <foreign lang="greek">προοίμιον</foreign> and commences at once with the <foreign lang="greek">πρόθεσις</foreign>, c. 13.

						<p>&lsquo;In public speaking there is least occasion for narrative, because no one ever gives a narrative of things future&rsquo; (the only province of deliberative Rhetoric, from which <hi rend="italic">all</hi> its materials are derived; <foreign lang="greek">ὡς ἔπος εἰπεῖν</foreign>): &lsquo;but if there <hi rend="italic">be</hi> a narrative, it must be of things past, in order that with these in their recollection they may be better able to deliberate about things to come&rsquo;. Gaisford refers to Dionys. Ars Rhet. X 14, <foreign lang="greek">ὅλη μὲν ἰδέα συμβουλευτικὴ διηγήσεως οὐ δεῖται· ἴσασι γὰρ οἱ βουλευόμενοι περὶ ὧν σκοποῦνται, καὶ δέονται μαθεῖν ὃ πρακτέον ἐστίν, οὐχ ὅπερ βουλευτέον</foreign>. </p>
						<p>&lsquo;Or it may be employed in the way of accusation or of praise&rsquo;, <foreign lang="greek">διηγήσονται, εἰ διηγοῦνται</foreign>, to be understood from the preceding. &lsquo;But in <pb n="197"/> that case, (the speaker who thus employs it) does not fulfil the proper function of the adviser&rsquo; (whose office is to exhort and dissuade). </p>
						<p>The following sentence to the end of the chapter I have done what I can to elucidate in the Introd. p. 354. No commentator, except Victorius, whose explanation I have there criticized, has bestowed a single word upon it; not even Spengel in his recent edition: I suppose he has given it up as hopeless. What it seems to me to mean is something of this kind&mdash;but I think there is most likely some latent corruption. &lsquo;If there be anything incredible in your narrative, you may promise your audience (omit <foreign lang="greek">τε</foreign>) to add<note anchored="yes"><foreign lang="greek">καὶ αἰτίαν</foreign> a reason in addition, besides the mere statement.</note> a reason (i.e. explanation, to <hi rend="italic">account for</hi> it), and a full, detailed, explanation of it as long as they please&rsquo;. <foreign lang="greek">διατάττειν</foreign> is one of the chief difficulties of the passage. The only appropriate meaning that occurs to me is to &lsquo;set out in order, i.e. set forth in full and clear detail&rsquo;: <foreign lang="greek">οἷς βούλονται</foreign> &lsquo;with what, with as many details as, they please&rsquo;. &lsquo;As Carcinus&rsquo; Jocasta, in his Oedipus, is perpetually promising, in answer to the inquiries of the man who is looking for her son&mdash;(something or other, which is left to be supplied by the hearer's knowledge of the context: probably, to satisfy him). And Sophocles' Haemon&rsquo;. This last example must be given up as hopeless: there is nothing in the extant play which could be interpreted as is required here. And what Carcinus' Jocasta has to do with the topic to be illustrated, is not easy to see. Carcinus' Medea has been already quoted II 23. 28, where an account is given of him in the note. His Thyestes is referred to, Poet. XVI 2, and a fault pointed out, XVII 2. And as if to aggravate the difficulties which surround the interpretation of this passage, Wagner, in his collection of the Tragic Fragments, has chosen to omit this reference to Carcinus. </p>

					<p>Of the various kinds of proof, the various ways in which facts and statements may be made to appear probable, <foreign lang="greek">πίστεις</foreign>, some are direct and logical, and appeal exclusively to the reasoning faculty; others indirect, which by appealing to the moral sense <foreign lang="greek">ἦθος</foreign>, or to the emotions <foreign lang="greek">πάθος</foreign>, support the logical arguments by the favourable impressions they produce upon the hearts and feelings of the listeners, who are ever ready to <pb n="198"/> draw inferences from what <hi rend="italic">they feel</hi> to the <hi rend="italic">truth of what is said;</hi> and further the adventitious and external aids, which are not invented by the speaker but found ready for use and applied by him in evidence of the facts of his case: of these three the first only have any pretension to the character of <foreign lang="greek">ἀποδεικτικαί</foreign>. But not even these are entitled to the name in its strict and proper sense, <foreign lang="greek">ἀπόδειξις</foreign> &lsquo;demonstration&rsquo; implying conclusions universal and necessary and a rigorous exact syllogistic method. This belongs, strictly speaking, exclusively to the domain of Science and to the sphere of certainty, to which no conclusion of Rhetoric can ever attain. When it is said therefore in &sect; 1, that &ldquo;the proofs of preceding statements, and refutation of those of the adversary&rdquo;&mdash;which from the third division of the speech&mdash;&ldquo;must be demonstrative&rdquo;,&mdash;no more is meant than that they must be demonstrated, so far as the nature and limits of rhetorical proof permit, that is, that they must be such, so far consistent with sound reasoning and the rules of logic, as will induce those who hear them to <hi rend="italic">believe</hi> what they seek to establish. We have very frequently had to remark the language of strict Logic applied to the laxer methods of Rhetoric, here it is done a little more formally than usual. </p>
					<p>&lsquo;The point to which this <hi rend="italic">proof</hi> must be directed (addressed) of the four questions on which the issue may turn, is the particular point on which the issue is actually joined between the two contending parties: for example, if the issue is the question of <hi rend="italic">fact</hi>, was the thing done or not? in the trial <hi rend="italic">this</hi> is the point that he must most aim at establishing; if of <hi rend="italic">harm or loss</hi>, injury, at <hi rend="italic">that;</hi> or if&mdash;these two being admitted&mdash;the question is one of <hi rend="italic">the degree</hi> or amount of the injury; or of the justice of the action&mdash;admitting the fact and the injury and even the amount charged&mdash;of that; just as much (in the three last cases) as if the issue had been one of that same thing as a <hi rend="italic">fact</hi>&rsquo;. Spalding, ad Quint. III 6. 60, seems to understand <foreign lang="greek">περὶ τοῦ γενέσθαι τοῦτο</foreign> of a distinct issue, the <foreign lang="greek">στάσις ὁρική</foreign>, or <hi rend="italic">status finitivus.</hi> </p>
					<div3 id="b3c17s2" type="section" n="2">
						<p>&lsquo;But let it not be forgotten that this issue (of <hi rend="italic">fact</hi>) is the only one in which it may happen that one of the two parties must necessarily be a rogue: for in such cases, ignorance (which exempts from responsibility, see note on c. 15. 3) cannot be pleaded (cannot be assigned as the cause or reason), as it may when the issue is the justice (or injustice) of the act&rsquo;&mdash;and the same of the <hi rend="italic">injury</hi>, and alleged degree or amount of the offence&mdash;&lsquo;and therefore in this issue alone the topic may be dwelt <pb n="199"/> upon, but not in the (three) others&rsquo;. It is important to observe here a qualification of the apparent meaning, which has not been&mdash;at all events distinctly&mdash;pointed out by the Commentators. It would not be true to say <hi rend="italic">universally</hi> that when the issue is that of fact, whether the act alleged has or has not been committed, that one of the two parties concerned must necessarily be a rogue: as when A accuses B of murder, the question is one of fact, is B guilty or not guilty? B may be perfectly innocent, though the circumstantial evidence is so strong as to justify A in bringing the charge. All that is meant is, that there is a certain class of cases which fall under this <hi rend="italic">status</hi> or issue, in which this topic may be safely used. Comp. Eth. Nic. V 10, 1135 <hi rend="italic">b</hi> 30, <foreign lang="greek">ὥσπερ ἐν τοῖς συναλλάγμασι περὶ τοῦ γενέσθαι ἀμφισβητοῦσιν, ὧν ἀνάγκη τὸν ἕτερον εἶναι μοχθηρόν, ἂν μὴ διὰ λήθην αὐτὸ δρῶσιν</foreign>. This is the case of a deposit, which A seeks to recover from B, who denies having received it. Here&mdash;unless either of them has forgotten the transaction&mdash;either A, if he seeks to recover what he knows that he has never confided, or B, if he refuses to restore what he knows has been lent him, must intend to defraud the other (Schrader).

						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ἐκεῖ δὲἀδήλων δέ</lemma>] &lsquo;whereas in the former case (forensic oratory) the speaker is concerned with the past, which, as Epimenides the Cretan said, is already known even to diviners; for he himself was not in the habit of divining the future, but only (interpreting) the obscurities of the past.&rsquo; </p>
						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">καὶ τοῖς μάντεσιν</lemma>] as has been noticed elsewhere, &ldquo;was doubtless meant by Epimenides as a sarcasm upon his prophetic brethren, who pretended to see into futurity. &lsquo;Even diviners&rsquo;, said he, &lsquo;impostors as they are, can prophesy what is past&rsquo;&rdquo;. Introd. p. 358, note. <pb n="203"/> </p>
						<p>The statement that Epimenides specially devoted himself as a soothsayer to solving the riddles of the past, is exemplified by his being invited by the Athenians to advise them as to the purification of the city from the pestilence which arose in consequence of the crime of Cylon (Plutarch, reipubl. ger. pr. 27, Pausanias, I 14. 4, Diogenes Laert. I 10: Grote, <hi rend="italic">H. G.</hi> chap. X <hi rend="italic">sub finem</hi>). Plato, who calls him a <foreign lang="greek">θεῖος ἀνήρ</foreign>, speaks of his foretelling the future (Legg. 642 D), and the very gift which in the text he appears to disclaim is similarly ascribed to him by Cicero, who after saying <hi rend="italic">est enim ars in iis qui nouas res coniectura persequuntur, veteres observatione didicerunt</hi>, classes Epimenides among those who are destitute of this art; <hi rend="italic">qui non ratione aut coniectura, observatis ac notatis signis, sed concitatione quadam animi, aut soluto liberoque motu, futura praesentiunt</hi> (de divin. I 18. 34). But the office of the prophet, or intermediary interpreter between God and man, was not necessarily confined to the prediction of the future, but also included the expounding of the will of heaven respecting the present and the past. Spengel observes: &ldquo;dicit <foreign lang="greek">ἐμαντεύετο</foreign>, non <foreign lang="greek">ἐμαντεύσατο</foreign>, i.e. plerumque, non semper.&rdquo; </p>
						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">καὶ ὁ νόμοσἀπόδειξιν</lemma>] &lsquo;Besides, in forensic pleadings, the <hi rend="italic">law</hi> supplies a subject; and when you once have your starting-point, it is easier to find your proof&rsquo;. </p>
						<p>&lsquo;And it (namely, public speaking) does not admit of many digressions, such as references to one's opponent or to oneself; or again, appeals to the emotions&rsquo;. The subject of <foreign lang="greek">οὐκ ἔχει</foreign> is <foreign lang="greek">τὸ δημηγορεῖν</foreign>, all the intervening clauses from <foreign lang="greek">ἐκεῖ δέ</foreign> down to <foreign lang="greek">ἀπόδειξιν</foreign> being parenthetical. </p>
						<p>By <foreign lang="greek">διατριβαί</foreign> are meant &lsquo;landing-places&rsquo;, where the speaker may pause and linger for a while, and whence he may even expatiate into a passing digression.

						<p>&lsquo;In speeches of display you must introduce laudations into your speech by way of episode, as Isocrates does; for he is always bringing in some character&rsquo;.

						<p>&lsquo;And this is what Gorgias meant when he remarked that he was never at a loss for something to say; for if (for instance) he speaks of <pb n="205"/> Achilles, he (naturally) praises Peleus, next Aeacus, then Zeus himself (the father of Aeacus); and similarly valour also (the special virtue of Achilles), and so and so (so <hi rend="italic">ad infinitum</hi>) <hi rend="italic">;</hi> and this is just what I have been describing&rsquo;. </p>
						<p>From this passage of Gorgias the existence of a panegyric oration &lsquo;in praise of Achilles&rsquo;, is inferred by Dr Thompson (on p. 178 of his ed. of the Gorgias), who also suggests that &ldquo;a fragment preserved by the Scholiast on Iliad IV 450 may have belonged to this speech: <foreign lang="greek">ἀνεμίσγοντο δὲ λίταις ἀπειλαὶ καὶ εὐχαῖς οἰμωγαί</foreign>.&rdquo; </p>
						<p>The unfailing resource of complimentary episodes on which Gorgias appears to have prided himself, may be paralleled by Pindar's favourite device of leading up by easy transitions to the praises of the Aeacidae (Isthm. IV (V) 20, <foreign lang="greek">τὸ δ’  ἐμὸν οὐκ ἄτερ Αἰακιδῶν κέαρ ὕμνων γεύεται</foreign>); and also by the artifice adopted by the rhetorician Lycophron, de Soph. El. 15, 174 <hi rend="italic">b</hi> 30, as explained by Alexander Aphrodisiensis:&mdash;&ldquo;the sophist Lycophron, when he was compelled by some persons to write an encomium upon the lyre, and found that he hadn't very much to say about it, first very briefly touched upon the praises of the sensible lyre, which we have here on earth, and then mounted up to that in heaven,...the constellation called the Lyre, upon which he composed a long and beautiful and excellent discourse&rdquo; (from Cope's translation in <hi rend="italic">Journal of Classical and Sacred Philology</hi>, Vol. II, No. V, p. 141). </p>
						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ἢ τὰ καὶ τὰ ποιεῖ</lemma>] In Vol. III, No. VII, p. 75 of the Journal above mentioned, Mr Cope has the following note: &ldquo;The sentence hangs so ill together, and the <foreign lang="greek">ἢ</foreign> has so little meaning, that I think we ought to change it into the relative pronoun <foreign lang="greek">ἥ</foreign>: and then the sentence will run &lsquo;and in like manner valour, which performs such and such feats,&rsquo; i. e. he first praises valour generally, and then proceeds to enumerate different acts of prowess; which may be multiplied <hi rend="italic">ad infinitum.</hi>&rdquo; This suggestion, it may be remarked, harmonizes fairly with the reading of MS A^{c} <foreign lang="greek">ἢ τὰ καὶ τὰ ποιεῖ ἢ</foreign> (not <foreign lang="greek">ὃ</foreign>) <foreign lang="greek">τοιόνδε ἐστίν</foreign>. It has been anticipated by Foss (de Gorgia p. 77 ap. Spengel) who proposes <foreign lang="greek">ὁμοίως δὲ καὶ ἀνδρίαν ἣ τὰ καὶ τὰ ποιεῖ ὃ τοῖόν γέ ἐστιν</foreign>. </p>

						<p>&lsquo;As regards ethical proof, since there are some things, which, if you say them of yourself, are either invidious or tedious or provoke contradiction, or which, if said of another, involve slander or rudeness, you must ascribe them to some one else instead&rsquo;. </p>
						<p>The reference to the Philippus of Isocrates points (according to Victorius) to p. 96 D &sect;&sect; 72&mdash;78, where the writer gets rid of the indelicacy of himself reminding Philip of the current imputation that his growing power <foreign lang="greek">οὐχ ὑπὲρ τῆς Ἑλλάδος ἀλλ’  ἐπὶ ταύτην αὐξάνεται</foreign>, by attributing it to others in the words, <foreign lang="greek">αἰσθάνομαι γάρ σε διαβαλλόμενον ὑπὸ τῶν σοὶ φθονούντων</foreign> in &sect; 73, and by describing it in &sect; 78 as <foreign lang="greek">τοιαύτην φήμην σαυτῷ περιφυομένην, ἣν οἱ μὲν ἐχθροὶ περιθεῖναί σοι ζητοῦσι</foreign>. This, however, seems to be open to the objection pointed out by Spengel, that Isocrates can hardly be regarded as putting what are really <hi rend="italic">his own</hi> views as a friend of Philip into the mouth of that monarch's enemies (&ldquo;at vix Isocrates ipse haec animo probans vera putabat&rdquo;). Spengel accordingly prefers taking it as a reference to &sect;&sect; 4&mdash;7, where, instead of expressing his own satisfaction with one of his compositions, he states that his friends who have heard it recited had been struck by its truthful statement of facts, &sect; 4, and had expected that, if published, it would have led to the establishment of peace; it so happened, however, that Philip had concluded peace, before the fastidious rhetorician had elaborated his pamphlet to a sufficient degree to think it deserving of publication. Perhaps a still more apposite passage, which is omitted by Victorius and Spengel, is that in p. 87 B, &sect; 23, where the writer, after describing himself as deterred by his friends from addressing Philip, adds that finally <foreign lang="greek">ἔσπευδον μᾶλλον ἠγὼ πεμφθῆναί σοι τὸν λόγον τοῦτον, ἔλεγον δ’  ὡς ἔλπίζουσιν οὐ μόνον σὲ καὶ τὴν πόλιν ἕξειν μοι χάριν ὑπὲρ τῶν εἰρημένων ἀλλὰ καὶ τοὺς Ἕλληνας ἅπαντας</foreign>. <pb n="209"/> </p>

The device is sufficiently transparent, even if it were not for the candid confession in &sect; 8, <foreign lang="greek">εἰ μὲν οὖν ἐπαινεῖν ἐμαυτὸν ἐπιχειροίην, ἑώρων οὔτε...ἐπιχαρίτως οὐδ’  ἀνεπιφθόνως εἰπεῖν περὶ αὐτῶν δυνησόμενος</foreign>. </p>

						<p>Aristotle's example of a <foreign lang="greek">γνώμη</foreign> seems to be a general reminiscence of a passage in Isocr.

					<p>This chapter treats of &lsquo;Interrogation&rsquo; of one's opponent (&sect;&sect; 1&mdash;4), and of &lsquo;Reply&rsquo; to his interrogations (&sect;&sect; 5, 6); it concludes with a few remarks on the use of &lsquo;ridicule&rsquo;, as an accessory to argument. These may be regarded as subdivisions of the general subject of proofs, <foreign lang="greek">πίστεις</foreign>, dealt with in the previous chapter, to which the present is an appendix. </p>
					<p>&ldquo;A favourite instrument of debate with speakers in the public assembly and law-courts is the interrogation of the adversary. The object of this is to enforce an argument; or to take the adversary by surprise and extract from him an unguarded admission; or to place him in an awkward dilemma, by shaping your question in such a way that he must either by avowing it admit something which his antagonist wishes to establish, or by refusing seem to give consent by his silence to that which the questioner wishes to insinuate; or to gain some similar advantage.&rdquo; Introd. p. 362. </p>
					<p>A Greek paraphrase of the first six sections of this chapter, with the headings <foreign lang="greek">περὶ ἐρωτήσεως</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">περὶ ἀποκρίσεως</foreign>, which owes its interest <pb n="211"/> mainly to the rareness of such commentaries on the Rhetoric, was edited in 1838 by Seguer from a MS in the library in Paris, and is reprinted in Spengel's <hi rend="italic">Rhetores Graeci</hi> I pp. 163&mdash;8, and also in his edition of the <hi rend="italic">Rhetoric</hi>, Vol. I pp. 147&mdash;152. It is a puerile piece of composition, but one or two extracts from it will be given where the writer's language really illustrates the text of Aristotle. </p>
					<p>On the subject of Interrogatories it may be noticed, that by Athenian Law either party to a suit might put questions to the other, and demand a reply, not only at the preliminary hearing (<foreign lang="greek">ἀνάκρισις</foreign>) but also at the trial itself (Plato, Apol. 25 D, <foreign lang="greek">ἀπόκριναι ὦ ̓γαθέ· καὶ γὰρ ὁ νόμος κελεύει ἀποκρίνασθαι</foreign>). In the former instance, the answers were taken down in writing, and produced in court if wanted; in the latter, the questions could only be asked by the party addressing the court, who could not himself be interrupted by any interrogation on the part of his opponent, but only by the enquiries of the jury, which were sometimes even invited by the speaker. (Comp. C. R. Kennedy's <hi rend="italic">Demosthenes</hi> IV Appendix VII <hi rend="italic">On Interrogatories</hi>). </p>
					<p>Such interrogations, judging from the few specimens that have come down to us, were of the simplest kind; and owing to the large number and the natural impatience of the audience present, (whether as members of the general assembly or of the jury, in cases of the deliberative or the forensic class respectively), anything approaching an elaborate and protracted cross-examination was quite out of the question. </p>
					<p>As instances we may quote the following: Isaeus Or. 10 (<foreign lang="greek">π. τοῦ Ἁγνίου κλήρου</foreign>) &sect;&sect; 4, 5, <foreign lang="greek">σὺ δ’  ἀνάβηθι δεῦρο ... ἐρωτήσω σε. ἀδελφός ἐσθ̓ ὁ παῖς Ἁγνιου, ἀδελφιδοῦς ἐξ ἀδελφοῦ ἢ ἐξ ἀδελφῆς γεγονὼς, ἢ ἀνεψιὸς, ἢ ἐξ ἀνεψιοῦ πρὸς μητρὸς ἢ πρὸς πατρός; ... δεῖ δή σε τῆς ἀγχιστείας, ὅ τι ὁ παῖς Ἁγνίᾳ προσήκει, τὸ γένος εἰπεῖν. φράσον οὖν τουτοισί.αἰσθάνεσθε ὅτι οὐκ ἔχει τὴν συγγένειαν εἰπεῖν, ἀλλ̓ ἀποκρίνεται πάντα μᾶλλον ἢ ὃ δεῖ μαθεῖν ὑμᾶς. καίτοι τόν γε πράττοντά τι δίκαιον οὐ προσῆκεν ἀπορεῖν ἀλλ̓ εὐθὺς λέγειν</foreign>. </p>

					<p>The subject of questioning and replying in sophistical debate is treated by Aristotle himself in the Sophistici Elenchi, esp. c. XV and XVI, (Grote's <hi rend="italic">Aristotle</hi> II pp. 109&mdash;115; see also Top. <foreign lang="greek">Θ</foreign>). Some of the more striking parallels will be quoted in the course of the commentary. </p>
					<div3 id="b3c18s1" type="section" n="1">
						<p>&lsquo;As to Interrogation, you may opportunely resort to it, when your opponent has said the opposite, so that as soon as one more <pb n="212"/> question is put to him, a contradictory result ensues&rsquo;, i.e. the result is a <hi rend="italic">reductio ad absurdum.</hi> </p>
						<p>This Topic is exemplified by Pericles' retort to Lampon, the soothsayer, who is mentioned in Arist. Av. 521, <foreign lang="greek">Λάμπων δ’  ὄμνυς̓ ἔτι καὶ νυνὶ τὸν χῆν̓ ὅταν ἐξαπατᾷ τι</foreign>, and Plut. Pericles c. VI, <foreign lang="greek">Λάμπωνα τὸν μάντιν</foreign>. On <foreign lang="greek">τελετή</foreign>, see note on II 24. 2. </p>
						<p>The fragment <foreign lang="greek">περὶ ἐρωτήσεως</foreign> (as Spengel points out), besides having <foreign lang="greek">ἤρετο</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">ἀνήρετο</foreign> instead of <foreign lang="greek">ἐπήρετο</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">ἤρετο</foreign> respectively, closes with the paraphrase <foreign lang="greek">συμφήσαντος δὲ τοῦ Λάμπωνος, καὶ πῶς εἶπεν ἀτέλεστος ὤν</foreign>. </p>

						<p>&lsquo;Or, secondly, (you may employ interrogation) when <hi rend="italic">one</hi> point is self-evident, and it is clear that the person interrogated will grant you the <hi rend="italic">other</hi> as soon as you put the question. For, when you have obtained your first premiss by asking your opponent to admit it, you must not proceed to put what is self-evident in the form of a question, but simply state the conclusion yourself&rsquo;. Soph. El. 15, 174 <hi rend="italic">b</hi> 38, <foreign lang="greek">οὐ δεῖ δὲ τὸ συμπέρασμα προτατικῶς ἐρωτᾶν· ἔνια δ’  οὐδ̓ ἐρωτητέον, ἀλλ̓ ὡς ὁμολογουμένῳ χρηστέον</foreign>.

						<p>The illustration is taken from the Apologia of Socrates. &lsquo;Socrates, when accused by Meletus of denying the existence of the gods, asked (<hi rend="italic">vulg. lect.</hi> said), if there was anything which he called divine, and on his admitting this, he enquired whether the divine beings (<foreign lang="greek">δαίμονες</foreign>) were not either children of the gods or of godlike nature, and on his answering &ldquo;Yes&rdquo;, &ldquo;Is there any one&rdquo; he said &ldquo;who believes in the existence of the children of the gods and yet denies that of the gods themselves?&rdquo; This corresponds only partially to the well-known passage in Plat. Apol. p. 27, already commented on in the note on II 23. 8. There is probably some corruption in the word <foreign lang="greek">εἴρηκεν</foreign> where we should expect <foreign lang="greek">ἠρώτα</foreign> or <foreign lang="greek">ἤρετο</foreign>. Spengel, following A^{c} and the <hi rend="italic">vetus translatio</hi>, reads <foreign lang="greek">εἴρηκεν ὡς ἂν δαιμόνιόν τι λέγοι, ἤρετο</foreign>. &ldquo;Illud <foreign lang="greek">ὁμολογήσαντος δὲ</foreign> sensui et consilio Aristotelis repugnat, neque <foreign lang="greek">εἴρηκεν εἰ</foreign> significat: <hi rend="italic">quaesivit ex Meleto num daemonion quid crederet.</hi> Sed Meletus de Socrate <foreign lang="greek">εἴρηκεν ὡς ἂν δαιμόνιόν τι λέγοι</foreign>.&rdquo; After quoting part of the passage of Plato, he says in conclusion, &ldquo;Vides Socratem id quod Meletus dixit, non interrogare, sed affirmare.&rdquo; <pb n="213"/> </p>

						<p>&lsquo;Fourthly, when it is impossible (for the opponent) to meet the question, without giving a sophistical answer&rsquo;. For the examples of this topic, <foreign lang="greek">ἔστι μὲν ἔστι δ’  οὔ, κ.τ.λ.</foreign>, comp. Soph. Elench. 19, 177 <hi rend="italic">a</hi> 21, &lsquo;the proper way for the respondent to deal with questions involving equivocation of terms or amphiboly of propositions is to answer them, at the outset, with a reserve for the double meaning&rsquo;: <foreign lang="greek">ὥσπερ τὸ σιγῶντα λέγειν ὅτι ἔστιν ὡς, ἔστι δ’  ὡς οὔ. καὶ τὰ δέοντα πρακτέον ἔστιν ἃ, ἔστι δ̓ ἃ οὔ</foreign> (Grote's <hi rend="italic">Ar.</hi> II 114), where the interrogation is characterized as sophistical, while here the same invidious epithet is applied to the answer. Comp. Top. <foreign lang="greek">Θ 7, ἐπὶ τῶν ἀσαφῶς καὶ πλεοναχῶς λεγομένων...τὸ μὲν ψεῦδος τὸ δ’  ἀληθές</foreign>. As an instance of a quibbling answer, we may compare the subtle distinction drawn by the over-intelligent servant in reply to the enquiry whether his master Euripides was at home; Ar. Ach. 396, (<foreign lang="greek">ἔνδον ἔστ’  Εὐριπίδης</foreign>;) <foreign lang="greek">οὐκ ἔνδον, ἔνδον τ’  ἐστὶν, εἰ γνώμην ἔχεις</foreign>. </p>
						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">θορυβοῦσιν</lemma>] This is a neutral word, and may be used of expressions of either pleasure or displeasure on the part of the audience, any &lsquo;sensation&rsquo; in fact, whether breaking out into applause or the reverse (see Riddell's note on its application to <foreign lang="greek">δικασταί</foreign>, Introd. to Plato's Apology, p. IX). Isocr. <foreign lang="greek">ἀντίδοσις,  20, μετὰ θορύβου καὶ χαλεπότητος ἀκροᾶσθαι τῶν ἀπολογουμένων</foreign>. It is used of disapprobation (as here) in Rhet. ad Alex. 18 (19). 3, 6, 7, 8. </p>
						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ὡς ἀποροῦντες</lemma>] It is not the <hi rend="italic">audience</hi> that is perplexed; on the contrary it has a perfectly clear opinion on the obviously shuffling character of the answer, and expresses its displeasure accordingly. It is the person who gives a &lsquo;sophistical&rsquo; answer, who is apparently perplexed; hence we should accept the correction <foreign lang="greek">ὡς ἀποροῦντος</foreign> proposed by Spengel and Schneidewin. The Paris MS A^{c} actually has <foreign lang="greek">ἀποροῦντας</foreign>, which suggested to Spengel the alternative emendation <foreign lang="greek">ἀποροῦντα</foreign>.

						<p>&lsquo;But otherwise&rsquo; (i.e. except under the above limitations), &lsquo;the speaker must not attempt interrogation; for if his opponent should interpose an objection, the questioner is considered beaten&rsquo;. <foreign lang="greek">ἐνστῇ</foreign> is here used of giving a check by interposing an &lsquo;instance&rsquo; or <foreign lang="greek">ἔνστασις</foreign>.

						<p>treats very briefly of &lsquo;jests&rsquo;, as a useful accessory in debate; <hi rend="italic">Ridiculum acri Fortius et melius magnas plerumque secat res</hi> (Hor. Sat. I 10. 14). The subject of <hi rend="italic">ridiculum</hi> is treated by Cicero de Oratore, II 58. 236 seq., Quintil. VI 3.22&mdash;112, <hi rend="italic">haec tota disputatio a Graecis</hi> <foreign lang="greek">περὶ γελοίου</foreign> <hi rend="italic">inscribitur</hi> (&sect; 22)...<hi rend="italic">usus autem maxime triplex, aut enim ex aliis risum petimus aut ex nobis aut ex rebus mediis</hi> (&sect; 23).

						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">δεῖν ἔφη Γοργίασὀρθῶς λέγων</lemma>] &lsquo;Gorgias laid it down, and rightly too, that you should confound (spoil the effect of) the seriousness of your opponents by ridicule, and their ridicule by seriousness&rsquo;. In a Scholium on Plat. Gorg. p. 473 E, (where Socrates says to Polus) <foreign lang="greek">γελᾷς; ἄλλο αὖ τοῦτο εἶδος ἐλέγχου ἐστὶν, ἐπειδάν τίς τι εἴπῃ, καταγελᾶν, ἐλέγχειν δὲ μή</foreign>, the dictum of Gorgias is quoted in the following form: (<foreign lang="greek">δεῖ</foreign>) <foreign lang="greek">τὰς σπουδὰς τῶν</foreign> <pb n="216"/> <foreign lang="greek">ἀντιδίκων γέλωτι ἐκλύειν, τὰ δὲ γελοῖα ταῖς σπουδαῖς ἐκκρούειν</foreign> (Plato, ed. Baiter and Orelli, p. 910 <hi rend="italic">b</hi> 20; Sauppe, <hi rend="italic">Fragm. Or. Att.</hi> III 131). The only material variation between the two forms of quotation is Aristotle's probably intentional alteration of <foreign lang="greek">τῶν ἀντιδίκων</foreign>, which would apply to the forensic branch alone, into <foreign lang="greek">τῶν ἐναντίων</foreign>, which extends the applicability of the remark to all the three branches of Oratory. Dr Thompson observes that &ldquo;the remark is one which could not have been made by an ordinary man, and the sentence is too nicely balanced for a mere colloquial dictum&rdquo; (<hi rend="italic">Gorgias</hi>, p. 178). The first half of Gorgias' precept may be exemplified by the familiar line, <hi rend="italic">And coxcombs vanquish Berkeley by a grin</hi> (Dr Brown's <hi rend="italic">Essay on Satire</hi> II 224). </p>
						<p>One of the best classical instances of the effective use of pleasantry to neutralize over-strictness on the part of one's opponent is Cicero's goodhumoured banter of his friends Sulpicius and Cato, in the speech <hi rend="italic">pro Murena</hi> (&sect;&sect; 19&mdash;30 and &sect;&sect; 61&mdash;65). We may also compare Dem. Or. 54 (<foreign lang="greek">κατὰ Κόνωνος</foreign>) &sect;&sect; 13 and (as an illustration of meeting jest by earnest) 20, <foreign lang="greek">εἶτα γελάσαντες ὑμεῖς ἀφήσετε; οὐ γὰρ ἂν γέλως ὑμῶν ἔλαβεν οὐδένα, εἰ παρὼν ἐτύγχανεν κ.τ.λ.</foreign> Comp. Or. 23 &sect; 206, <foreign lang="greek">ἂν ἓν ἢ δύ̓ ἀστεῖα εἴπωσι...ἀφίετε</foreign>, Arist. Vesp. 566, <foreign lang="greek">οἱ δὲ λέγουσιν μίθους· ἡμῖν οἱ δ’  Αἰσώπου τι γέλοιον· οἱ δὲ σκώπτους̓ ἵν̓ ἐγὼ γελάσω καὶ τὸν θυμὸν κατάθωμαι</foreign>.

I 29. 103, <hi rend="italic">ipsum genus iocandi non profusum nec immodestum, sed ingenuum et facetum esse debet</hi>, &sect; 104, <hi rend="italic">facilis est distinctio ingenui et illiberalis ioci.</hi> </p>
						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">τὸ ἁρμόττον αὑτῷ λήψεται</lemma>] Cic. Orator, &sect; 88, <hi rend="italic">ridiculo sic usurum oratorem, ut nec nimis frequenti, nec scurrile sit...neque aut</hi> sua persona <hi rend="italic">aut iudicum aut tempore alienum.</hi> There is a kind of quiet irony observable in Aristotle's hint that the orator is to select his special line of pleasantry according as he happens to be a gentleman or the reverse. </p>
						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">εἰρωνείαἑτέρον</lemma>] &lsquo;Irony is more gentlemanly than buffoonery: one who resorts to irony makes his joke for his own amusement only, whereas the buffoon does so for an ulterior object&rsquo;. On <foreign lang="greek">βωμολοχία</foreign>, comp. Eth. Nic. IV 14, 1128 <hi rend="italic">a</hi> 4, <foreign lang="greek">οἱ τῷ γελοίῳ ὑπερβάλλοντες βωμολόχοι δοκοῦσιν εἶναι καὶ φορτικοὶ, γλιχόμενοι πάντως τοῦ γελοίου καὶ μᾶλλον στοχαζόμενοι τοῦ γέλωτα ποιῆσαι ἢ τοῦ λεγειν εὐσχήμονα καὶ μὴ λυπεῖν τὸν σκωπτόμενον</foreign>. <hi rend="italic">ib.</hi> line 34, <foreign lang="greek">ὁ δὲ βωμολό-</foreign> <pb n="217"/> <foreign lang="greek">χος ἥττων ἐστὶ τοῦ γελοίου, καὶ οὔτε ἑαυτοῦ οὔτε τῶν ἄλλων ἀπεχόμενος, εἰ γέλωτα ποιήσει</foreign>.

						<p>It is a nice question whether <foreign lang="greek">αὑτοῦ ἕνεκα</foreign> is neuter (as Mr Cope takes it in the <hi rend="italic">text</hi> of the Introd. p. 366), or &lsquo;perhaps masculine&rsquo; (as he suggests in the <hi rend="italic">note</hi>, and as I have ventured to translate it above). The latter is the view supported by Victorius: &ldquo;Qui utitur dissimulatione, sibique semper in sermone detrahit, atque aliis plusquam vere concedi possit, tribuit, ut ipse oblectetur, voluptatemque ex aliorum stultitia capiat, hoc facit. quare sibi servit: contra scurra ridiculus est, et iocos undique captat, ut alii voluptatem gignat, quod illiberale ac sordidum est, omnia facere, ut alii turpiter inservias.&rdquo; </p>

				<div id="b3c19" type="chapter" n="19">

					<p>The book appropriately closes with a chapter on the Peroration: the contents of that portion of the speech are distributed under four heads: (1) to inspire the audience with a favourable opinion of yourself and an unfavourable one of your opponents, (2) amplification and extenuation, (3) the excitement of the emotions of your audience, (4) refreshing their memory by recapitulation. </p>
					<p>Cornificius, II 30. 47, gives three divisions, (1) <hi rend="italic">enumeratio</hi>, (2) <hi rend="italic">amplificatio</hi>, (3) <hi rend="italic">commiseratio.</hi> Cic. de Inv. I 52. 98, (1) <hi rend="italic">enumeratio</hi>, (2) <hi rend="italic">indignatio</hi>, (3) <hi rend="italic">conquestio.</hi> Apsines 12 p. 384, (1) <foreign lang="greek">ἀνάμνησις</foreign>, (2) <foreign lang="greek">ἔλεος</foreign>, (3) <foreign lang="greek">δείνωσις</foreign> (<foreign lang="greek">ἡ δὲ δείνωσις κατὰ τὴν αὔξησιν θεωρεῖται</foreign>). <hi rend="italic">Amplificatio</hi> and <hi rend="italic">commiseratio</hi> are sometimes brought under one head, thus reducing the divisions to two, as in Cic. part. orat. 15. 52, (1) <hi rend="italic">amplificatio</hi>, (2) <hi rend="italic">enumeratio</hi> (Volkmann, <hi rend="italic">die Rhetorik der Griechen und R&ouml;mer</hi>, &sect; 29). </p>
					<p>In spite of what is here said about <foreign lang="greek">αὔξησις</foreign>, the student of ancient eloquence cannot fail to be struck by the quiet character of most of the perorations of the Attic orators. Perhaps the tamest of all (to our modern taste) is the closing sentence of Lysias Or. 22 (<foreign lang="greek">κατὰ τῶν σιτοπώλων</foreign>) &sect; 22, <foreign lang="greek">οὐκ οἶδ’  ὅ τι δεῖ πλείω λέγειν· περὶ μὲν γὰρ τῶν ἄλλων τῶν ἀδικούντων, ὅτε δικάζονται, δεῖ παρὰ τῶν κατηγόρων πυθέσθαι, τὴν δὲ τούτων πονηρίαν ἅπαντες ἐπίστασθε. ἂν οὖν τούτων καταψηφίσησθε, τά τε δίκαια ποιήσετε καὶ ἀξιώτερον τὸν σῖτον ὠνήσεσθε· εἰ δὲ μὴ, τιμιώτερον</foreign>. It is well remarked by Brougham that &ldquo;the perorations, if by this we mean the concluding sentences of all, in the Greek orations, are calm and tame, compared with the rest of their texture, and especially with their penultimate <pb n="218"/> portions, which rise to the highest pitch of animation&rsquo; (vol. VII, <hi rend="italic">Rhetorical Dissertations</hi>, pp. 25, 184; see also especially Jebb's <hi rend="italic">Attic Orators</hi> I p. ciii). </p>
					<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">πέφυκεἐπιχαλκεύειν</lemma>] &lsquo;For the natural order is first to prove your own case to be true and your opponent's to be false; and after that, to use praise and blame, and to elaborate these topics&rsquo;. These words give the reason for giving the <hi rend="italic">first</hi> place in the four heads to inspiring in the audience a favourable opinion towards yourself. </p>
					<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ἐπιχαλκεύειν</lemma>] is a difficult word to translate satisfactorily in the present context. Victorius dubiously explains it: &ldquo;explire et quod factum iam est cursim festinanterque eo consilio ut concinnes, iterare ac repetere.&rsquo; It is metaphorically used in Arist. Nub. 422, where Strepsiades offers himself (not his son, as Ernesti says <hi rend="italic">Lex. Techn.</hi> s.v.,) to Socrates, as sturdy and tough material for him to hammer upon and forge to his purpose, <foreign lang="greek">ἀλλ’  ἕνεκέν γε ψυχῆς στερρᾶς...ἀμέλει θαρρῶν, οὕνεκα τούτων ἐπιχαλκεύειν παρέχοιμ̓ ἄν</foreign> (for a Latin metaphor from the anvil, comp. Horace, <hi rend="italic">A.P.</hi> 441, <hi rend="italic">male tornatos incudi reddere versus</hi>). At first sight the word might be supposed to refer to <foreign lang="greek">ἀνάμνησις</foreign>, which is subsequently explained in the words <foreign lang="greek">πολλάκις εἰπεῖν</foreign>, in which case it would mean &lsquo;to hammer your subject down&rsquo;, &lsquo;drive it home&rsquo;; but <foreign lang="greek">μετὰ τοῦτο</foreign> in &sect; 2 shews that in the present section Ar. is only dwelling on the first of the four heads of the epilogue, and does not at present touch on <foreign lang="greek">ἀνάμνησις</foreign>, which is reserved for &sect; 4. Consequently we must understand it to mean &lsquo;to elaborate&rsquo;, &lsquo;to finish off&rsquo;, the topics belonging to the first head. It may also mean to mould the audience to one's purpose. Brandis in Schneidewin's <hi rend="italic">Philologus</hi> IV I, p. 45, points out that his <hi rend="italic">Anonymus</hi> read the clause as follows: <foreign lang="greek">καὶ μετὰ</foreign> (not <foreign lang="greek">οὕτω</foreign>) <foreign lang="greek">τὸ ἐπαινεῖν καὶ ψέγειν τὸ</foreign> (not <foreign lang="greek">καὶ</foreign>) <foreign lang="greek">ἐπιχαλκεύειν</foreign>, in which case the last word corresponds to the <hi rend="italic">third</hi> head, <foreign lang="greek">εἰς τὰ πάθη καταστῆσαι τὸν ἀκροατήν</foreign>. </p>
					<p>&lsquo;Now (in this) you must aim at one of two objects; to represent yourself as either relatively or absolutely good, and your opponent as either relatively or absolutely bad&rsquo;. As is remarked in the Introd. p. 368, &lsquo;the virtue assumed may be either virtue <hi rend="italic">per se</hi>, and independent of all other considerations, as times, places, and persons&mdash;or in default of this, at any rate good to the judges or audience; as it may be, useful, or well-disposed&rsquo;.

					<div3 id="b3c19s2" type="section" n="2">
						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">δεδειγμένωνἐστίν</lemma>] &lsquo;The next point in the natural order is to proceed to amplify what has already been proved (<foreign lang="greek">δεδειγμένον</foreign>), or again to depreciate (what has been proved by your opponent); for the facts must be <pb n="219"/> admitted, if one is to treat of the question of degree (by way of amplification or the reverse); just as the growth of the body arises from something pre-existing.&rsquo; <foreign lang="greek">δεδειγμένον</foreign> is supported by the <hi rend="italic">vetus translatio</hi> and all the MSS except A^{c}, which has <foreign lang="greek">δεδειγμένων</foreign>, an awkward genitive absolute which is left standing alone owing to the loss of some words which would have made the sentence run like the next transition in &sect; 3, <foreign lang="greek">μετὰ δὲ ταῦτα, δήλων ὄντων καὶ οἷα καὶ ἡλίκα</foreign>. Spengel suggests as an alternative that the participle refers to &ldquo;ipsam argumentationem, i.e. confirmationem et confutationem, quod suadent verba <foreign lang="greek">δεῖ γὰρ τὰ πεπραγμένα ὁμολογῆσθαι</foreign>.&rdquo; </p>

					<div3 id="b3c19s4" type="section" n="4">
						<p>&lsquo;The remaining branch of the peroration is the recapitulation of the previous parts of the speech. At this point you may appropriately do what some, absurdly enough, advise one to do in the exordium. They recommend you to to state your points again and again that they may be distinctly understood. In the exordium, however, you should simply state the subject of the speech, that the point at issue may be clearly seen; in the peroration you have to state summarily the means whereby your case has been proved&rsquo;. <pb n="220"/> </p>

						<p>&lsquo;(The recapitulation) may also consist of a comparison (of the opponent's case with your own); you may either compare what both said on the same point, or else (you may do so) without setting each point over against the other&rsquo;. </p>
						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ἢ ἐκ παραβολῆς</lemma>] as <foreign lang="greek">ἀντιπαραβολὴ</foreign> is actually the subject of all the preceding part of the section, <foreign lang="greek">ἐκ παραβολῆς</foreign> cannot be contrasted with <foreign lang="greek">οὕτως</foreign>, but must be identical with it. Hence we should either strike out this clause, or at any rate (with Victorius and Spengel), put <foreign lang="greek">ἢ</foreign> into brackets, in which case <foreign lang="greek">ἢ δὴ οὕτως</foreign> will be explained if necessary by <foreign lang="greek">ἐκ παραβολῆς</foreign>. Possibly, however, the clause is due to the intrusion into the text of a marginal explanation of <foreign lang="greek">οὕτως</foreign> such as an abbreviated form of <foreign lang="greek">ἤγουν</foreign> (the scholiast's common equivalent for <hi rend="italic">scilicet</hi>) <foreign lang="greek">ἐκ παραβολῆς</foreign>. </p>
						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">κατὰ φύσιν</lemma>] i. e. your recapitulation may follow and contrast your own points in the natural order, as they were spoken; and then, if you please, separately, what has been said by your opponent. </p>
						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">τελευτὴλόγος ᾖ</lemma>] &lsquo;As a conclusion (to a speech) the most suitable style is that which has no conjunctions, to make it a true peroration, and not an actual oration&rsquo;. </p>
						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">τελευτῇ</lemma> is with much plausibility conjectured by Victorius, and the conjecture is supported by F. A. Wolf. The nominative is possibly due to the copyist being misled by the apparent parallelism above, <foreign lang="greek">ἀρχὴ δὲ διότι κ.τ.λ.τῆς λέξεως</foreign> is constructed with <foreign lang="greek">ἡ ἀσύνδετος</foreign>; on this kind of &lsquo;attraction&rsquo;, comp. note on III 9. 3, <foreign lang="greek">ἡ εἰρομένη τῆς λέξεως</foreign>. </p>

						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">εἴρηκα, ἀκηκόατε, ἔχετε, κρίνατε</lemma>] &lsquo;I must now close; you have heard all; the facts are in your hands; I ask for your verdict&rsquo;. Considering the carelessness of style which characterizes many portions of the <hi rend="italic">Rhetoric</hi>, it is all the more striking to find its close marked by a sentence so happily chosen,&mdash;a sentence which at once illustrates the point under <pb n="221"/> consideration and also serves as an appropriate farewell to the subject of the treatise; as though Aristotle had added at the conclusion of his course: &lsquo;I have said all that I had to say; my lectures are now finished; I leave the subject in your hands, and trust it to your judgment&rsquo;. The closing words of the Sophistici Elenchi are at least equally effective, <foreign lang="greek">λοιπὸν ἂν εἴη πάντων ὑμῶν ἢ τῶν ἠκροαμένων ἔργον τοῖς μὲν παραλελειμμένοις τῆς μεθόδου συγγνώμην τοῖς δ’  εὑρημένοις πολλὴν ἔχειν χάριν</foreign>. </p>
						<p>The illustration is doubtless a reminiscence of the closing words of one of the best-known speeches of Lysias, Or. 12 (<foreign lang="greek">κατ’  Ἐρατοσθένους</foreign>), <foreign lang="greek">παύσομαι κατηγορῶν· ἀκηκόατε, ἑωράκατε, πεπόνθατε· ἔχετε, δικάζετε</foreign>, a passage which may perhaps find its modern equivalent in some such words as these: </p>
