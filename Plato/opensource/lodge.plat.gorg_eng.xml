<div type="section" n="447a">
<p>I. </p><p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">πολέμου καὶ μάχης</lemma>: Socrates and Chaerephon come just after Gorgias has finished his lecture. Callicles receives them with a jest, the point of which lies in the <foreign lang="greek">οὕτω</foreign>. In the double expression, the more general precedes, as is natural, the more definite.</p><p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">μεταλαγχάνειν</lemma>: occurs also in <title>Rep.</title> 429 a with <foreign lang="greek">ἐπιστήμης</foreign>, and <title>Leg.</title> 873 c with <foreign lang="greek">αἰσχύνης</foreign>. It is rare.
</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">τὸ λεγόμενον</lemma>: in appos. with the sentence. See G. 137, 3; H. 626 b.</p><p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">κατόπιν ἑορτῆς</lemma>: proverbial, like post festum. This would call up to the Greek mind their public exhibitions, and the banquets with which they closed. Here is probably also an allusion to the extravagant enthusiasm which led the Athenians to designate as festivals those days on which Gorgias lectured. See Introd.  &sect; 4 end
</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">καὶ μάλα γ’  ἀστείας</lemma>: Hirschig remarks the frequency of such answers as these, which avoid the repetition of the last word of the preceding question. <title>Cf. Theaet.</title> 168 e <foreign lang="greek">ἀλλ’  οὔ τοι σοῦ γε, ὦ Θεόδωρε, ἄμεινον</foreign>, <title>Crat.</title> 391 b.</p><p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ἀττείας</lemma>: properly <gloss>belonging to a city.</gloss> It became an adj. of quality inasmuch as city festivals and celebrations are naturally superior to those of the country. It is used here in a good sense, though it may also mean &ldquo;citified.&rdquo;
</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ἐπεδείξατο</lemma>: the aor. is necessitated by the time-limit (<foreign lang="greek">ὀλίγον πρότερον</foreign>).</p><p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ὀλίγον πρότερον</lemma>: the first word is an acc. of extent; the second is adverbial. <pb n="34"/>
</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">τούτων</lemma>: the pl. refers to the fact and its consequences.</p><p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ὅδε</lemma>: is deictic.</p><p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ἐν ἀγορᾷ</lemma>: the omission of the art. shows that this was a phrase like &lsquo;in town,&rsquo; &lsquo;on change.&rsquo; By this time, <foreign lang="greek">ἀγορά</foreign> had come in Athens to mean simply the exchange, or marketplace, where people assembled not for public debate (that was in the Pnyx), but for business. It was a favorite resort of Socrates, since there the concourse of people offered him the best opportunity for prosecuting his god-given vocation (cf. Introd. to <title>Apol.</title> &sect; 25, and <title>Apol.</title> 33 a ff.). Cf. Xen. <title>Mem.</title> i. I. 10 <foreign lang="greek">ἀλλὰ μὴν ἐκεῖνός γε ἀεὶ μὲν ἦν ἐν τῷ φανερῷ· πρωί τε γὰρ εἰς τοὺς περιπάτους καὶ τὰ γυμνάσια ᾔει καὶ πληθούσης ἀγορᾶς ἐκεῖ φανερὸς ἦν, κτἑ.</foreign> </p><p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ἀναγκάσας</lemma>: the literal meaning is not to be pressed. Chaerephon as the constant companion of Socrates took the liveliest interest in all his actions.

</p></div>
<div type="section" n="447b">
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">οὐδὲν πρᾶγμα</lemma>: shows the asyndeton of ordinary conversation.&mdash; </p><p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ἐγὼ γὰρ καὶ ἰάσομαι</lemma>: prob. contains some allusion to the story of Telephus, who when wounded by Achilles received from the oracle the assurance <foreign lang="greek">ὁ τρώσας</foreign> (<foreign lang="greek">καὶ</foreign>) <foreign lang="greek">ἰάσεται</foreign>. The myth was made the subject of a noted  tragedy by Euripides.
</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ὥστε ἐπιδείξεται</lemma> <foreign lang="greek">· ὥστε</foreign>, when combined with the ind., can for all practical purposes be treated as if it were compounded of <foreign lang="greek">οὕτως</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">τέ</foreign>. Cf. Lat. <foreign lang="la">itaque</foreign>. See on <bibl n="Plat. Gorg. 458d"> 458 d</bibl>.</p><p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ἐπιδείξεται</lemma>: here used absolutely in the same sense as above. The fut. has two sides, one corresponding to each condition; thus it is equiv. to (1) <foreign lang="greek">ἐθέλει ἐπιδείκνυσθαι εἰ δοκεῖ</foreign>, and (2) <foreign lang="greek">ἐπιδείξεται ἐὰν βούλῃ</foreign>. Cf. a different case in <bibl n="Plat. Gorg. 502b"> 502 b</bibl>, with note.
</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">τί δέ</lemma>: the question shows that Chaerephon had not anticipated any great eagerness on Socrates' part.
</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ἐπ’  αὐτό</lemma>: the pronoun is emphatic. See on <bibl n="Plat. Gorg. 458a"> 458 a</bibl>. The emphasis is heightened by <foreign lang="greek">γέ</foreign>.
</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ὅταν βούλησθε</lemma> <foreign lang="greek"> κτἑ.</foreign>: contains an invitation, the basis of which is given by the clause with <foreign lang="greek">γάρ</foreign>. The original conclusion of the condition was to be <foreign lang="greek">ἐπιδείξεται</foreign>, but in the course of the <foreign lang="greek">γάρ</foreign> clause the speaker lost sight of this and continued with the co-ordinate construction.</p><p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">παρ’  ἐμὲ ἥκειν οἴκαδε</lemma>: this shows that the speakers are neither in nor before the house of Callicles. On the place of meeting, see Introd. &sect; 17. <pb n="35"/>

</p></div>
<div type="section" n="447c">
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ἐθελήσειεν ἄν</lemma>: Socrates uses the opt. with <foreign lang="greek">ἄν</foreign> a great deal, esp. when he first meets a person. It is the mood of courtesy, but not of argument. In this dialogue the opt. preponderates at the beginning, but the subjv. overtakes it in the argumentative passage 471, 472; while in the whole dialogue the proportion of subjs. to opt. is 3 to 2.
</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">διαλεχθῆναι</lemma>: emphasized in order to contrast Socrates' method with the <foreign lang="greek">ἐπίδειξις</foreign> of Gorgias.
</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">δύναμις</lemma> (vis): i.e. the power and inner meaning of the art, with which the <foreign lang="greek">ἐπάγγελμα</foreign> should correspond,&mdash;the scope or compass.</p><p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ἐπαγγέλλεται</lemma> <foreign lang="greek"> κτἑ.</foreign>: cf. <title>Apol.</title> 33 b <foreign lang="greek">ὧν μήτε ὑπεσχόμην μάθημα μήτε ἐδίδαξα. ἐπαγγέλλεσθαι</foreign> is the regular word in Greek for &lsquo;advertise,&rsquo; &lsquo;profess.&rsquo;
</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">τὴν δὲ ἄλλην ἐπίδειξιν</lemma>: it does not follow from this that Socrates considered the <foreign lang="greek">διαλεχθῆναι</foreign> as a kind of <foreign lang="greek">ἐπίδειξις</foreign>. It is only an example of the idiomatic Greek usage of <foreign lang="greek">ἄλλος</foreign>, which does not include but excludes the word with which it is connected. Cf. <bibl n="Plat. Gorg. 473c"> 473 c</bibl> <foreign lang="greek">πολιτῶν καὶ ἄλλων ξένων</foreign>, <title>Apol.</title> 36 b. See G. 142, 2, N. 3; H. 705. We must use a circumlocution, or another word, in English. In Cal licles' answer, however, the attributive force is regained.
</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ὥσπερ σὺ λέγεις</lemma>: const. closely with <foreign lang="greek">εἰσαῦθις</foreign>, as referring to the invitation of Callicles to come to his home.
</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">οὐδὲν οἷον τὸ αὐτὸν ἐρωτᾶν</lemma>: <hi rend="italic">there is nothing like asking the man himself.</hi> The articular infinitive is a favorite with Plato. He uses it most commonly in the acc. The nom. comes next in frequency, with the gen. a close third. The dat. is much less frequent. The pr. tense occurs nine times oftener than the aor., showing a great advance on Pindar. See <title>Am. Jour. Phil.</title> III. 193-201.
</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">αὐτῷ</lemma>: on account of its meaning (&ldquo;the master,&rdquo; Kr. 51. 5, 4; H. 681 c) is placed in this emphatic position. On the matter itself see Introd. &sect; 7, and the passage from <title>Meno</title> quoted Introd. N. 12. Auditors are present also at the following dialogue (cf. Introd. &sect; 17 end).</p><p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ἐκέλευε</lemma>: imperf., because the same bidding or invitation was given to the different members of the group. <title>He bade us all.</title>
</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">καλῶς λέγεις</lemma>: expresses more satisfaction than <foreign lang="greek">εὖ λέγεις</foreign> just before. <pb n="36"/>

</p></div>
<div type="section" n="447d">
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">τί ἔρωμαι</lemma>: deliberative subjunctive.
</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ὅστις ἐστίν</lemma>: <foreign lang="greek">ὅστις</foreign> is regularly used to ask the question &lsquo;who&rsquo; after a neg. (cf. <bibl n="Plat. Gorg. 524e"> 524 e</bibl>, <bibl n="Plat. Gorg. 526b"> 526 b</bibl>); but in all cases it may be used to express the idea of quality. See on <bibl n="Plat. Gorg. 453b"> 453 b</bibl>.
</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ὥσπερ ἂν . . . ἀπεκρίνατο ἄν</lemma>: <foreign lang="greek">ὥσπερ ἂν εἰ</foreign> is phraseological, and the second <foreign lang="greek">ἄν</foreign> comes in unconsciously with the conditional apodosis. The use of the aor. with <foreign lang="greek">ἄν</foreign> in the apodosis, following an imperf. with <foreign lang="greek">εἰ</foreign> in the protasis, where both refer to the same sphere of time, is not uncommon. In Plato, according to GMT. 414, it appears to be confined to such phrases as <foreign lang="greek">εἶπον ἄν, ἀπεκρινάμην ἄν</foreign>. But similar constructions with other verbs are found in Dem., Aristoph., Soph., Eur., Xen., <hi rend="italic">etc. Cf.</hi> Dem. xix. 162, Ar. <title>Eq.</title> 507.</p><p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">δημιουργός</lemma>: see on <bibl n="Plat. Gorg. 452a"> 452 a</bibl>.

<milestone n="2" unit="part"/></p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">μανθάνω</lemma>: one example suffices  to make the idea of Socrates clear to Chaerephon; two are not enough for Polus. This is, however, due to the fact that Chaerephon is familiar with Socrates' methods, while they are new and strange to Polus.
</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ἀποκρίνεσθαι</lemma> <foreign lang="greek"> κτἑ.</foreign>: this is the <foreign lang="greek">τί</foreign> of Socrates' question above in c. The tense shows that it is a general standing announcement.
</p></div>
<div type="section" n="448a">
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ἦ που ἄρα</lemma> <foreign lang="greek"> κτἑ.</foreign>: spoken in a wondering, admiring tone which expects an answer. &ldquo;Surely, then, you must have but little difficulty in re-plying, Gorgias.&rdquo; The irony lies in (the inferential) <foreign lang="greek">ἄρα</foreign> as well as in <foreign lang="greek">ῥᾳδίως</foreign>. On the pushing nature and insolence of Polus, see Introd. &sect; 14. What is said generally in <title>Meno</title> 70 b (see Introd. N. 12) of the pupils of Gorgias applies excellently to him.
</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ἐμοῦ</lemma>: by a very natural shift, <pb n="37"/>  after <foreign lang="greek">τούτου</foreign>.&mdash;&lsquo;Gor. <hi rend="italic">You may try the experiment if you please, Chaerephon.</hi> Pol. <title>Yes</title>, '<hi rend="italic">egad, and upon me too, if you like, Chaerephon.</hi>&rsquo; Cope.
</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">καὶ ἀπειρηκέναι</lemma>: gives the ground of Polus' offer. Possibly he may also wish to intimate that Gorgias may now fairly retire, and yield the field to another.

</p></div>
<div type="section" n="448b">
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">τί δὲ τοῖτο</lemma>: sc. <foreign lang="greek">διαφέρει</foreign>. &ldquo;What difference does this make?&rdquo; Cf. <bibl n="Plat. Gorg. 497e"> 497 e</bibl>. Polus does not wish to slight his master, but only to win admiration for himself.
</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">̔Ηρόδικος</lemma>: this brother of Gor gias (see Introd. &sect; 4) must not be confounded with another physician of the same name who came from Selymbria (<title>Rep.</title> iii. 406 a, <title>Phaedr.</title> 227 d, <title>Prot.</title> 316 d), and was famed as the first to insist upon the value of gymnastics for health.
</p></div>
<div type="section" n="448c">
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ὅπερ</lemma>: after <foreign lang="greek">τίνα</foreign> by an easy transfer to the actual idea,&mdash;&lsquo;name.&rsquo;

Aristophon's brother was thecelebrated painter Polygnotus of Thasus.

Polus speaks as from a book&mdash; perhaps from his own book  <bibl n="Plat. Gorg. 462b">(462 b)</bibl>. <pb n="38"/>

 He overdoes the use of those figures, with which Gorgias also was accustomed to amuse himself, i.e. &lsquo;paronomasia&rsquo; (<foreign lang="greek">κατὰ τέχνην . . . κατὰ τύχην</foreign>) and other phonetic figures in regard to the names of which theorists themselves were not at one. He uses the poetic <foreign lang="greek">αἰῶνα</foreign> instead of <foreign lang="greek">βίον</foreign>. His statements are indefinite and cloudy, and finally he brings forward a wholly general attribute&mdash;as Socrates proves in e by the distinction between <foreign lang="greek">ποία</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">τίς</foreign>&mdash;of the matter in question, instead of its name. To speak of rhetoric as <foreign lang="greek">καλλίστη τῶν τεχνῶν</foreign> is furthermore dialectically inappropriate, although it well agrees with the artistic design by drawing attention thus early to this idea. For other examples of similar mannerisms, see the speeches which go under the name of Gorgias (i.e. in the appendix to Blass' edition of Antiphon), and which, whether genuine or not, show admirably the peculiarities of the  Gorgianic school.

<milestone n="3" unit="part"/></p></div>
<div type="section" n="448d">
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">παρεσκευάσθαι εἰς</lemma>:  <gloss>equipped for</gloss>.  The phrase is a military one; hence <foreign lang="greek">λόγους</foreign> is almost equiv. to the later <foreign lang="greek">λογομαχίαν</foreign>, &lsquo;disputation.&rsquo; The reference is to the readiness with which Polus begins his harangue.
</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">τί μάλιστα</lemma>: <hi rend="italic">how so, pray?</hi> To Gorgias' view the question has been well answered.
</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">8</lemma> f. </p><p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">οὐκ . . . ἀλλά</lemma>: the construction is colloquial. <foreign lang="greek">οὐκ</foreign> is to be translated <hi rend="italic">no!</hi> The following clause with <foreign lang="greek">γέ</foreign> serves to give the reason for <foreign lang="greek">οὐκ</foreign>, &ldquo;that is, if.&rdquo; The negative color of the whole complex causes the speaker to ground his position by <foreign lang="greek">ἀλλά</foreign> where one would more naturally find <foreign lang="greek">γάρ</foreign>. It is not necessary to fill out the ellipsis with <foreign lang="greek">ἂν ἥδιον σέ</foreign> either in Greek or English.
</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">δῆλος γάρ μοι</lemma>: on the personal construction, see on <bibl n="Plat. Gorg. 449b"> 449 b</bibl>. <pb n="39"/>
</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">διαλέγεσθαι</lemma>: the most unassuming name by which Socrates can characterize his practice, so completely the reverse of the commonly used rhetoric. The inf. is an acc. verbal noun.

</p></div>
<div type="section" n="448e">
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ὥσπερ τινὸς ψέγοντος</lemma>: equiv. to <foreign lang="greek">ὥσπερ ἂν εἴ τις ἔψεγε</foreign>.
</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ὑπετείνατο</lemma>: cf. the Eng. use of &lsquo;lay down a proposition or principle&rsquo; to serve as analogy for future guidance. Note the asyndeton which appears somewhat harsh, but is not uncommon in clauses with <foreign lang="greek">ὥσπερ</foreign>. <title>Cf. Alcib. I.</title> 108 d <foreign lang="greek">τί οὖν τὸ κατὰ ταύτην ὀρθῶς γιγνόμενόν ἐστιν</foreign>; <foreign lang="greek">ὥσπερ ἐκεῖ ἐγώ σοι τὸ κατὰ τὴν τέχνην ἔλεγον ὀρθῶς, τὴν γυμναστικήν, καὶ σὺ δὴ οὖν οὕτως</foreign>  <foreign lang="greek">ἐνταῦθα τί φῄς</foreign>;
</p></div>
<div type="section" n="449a">
<p>Socrates accepts tentatively the statement which has been so continually advanced, that <foreign lang="greek">ῥητορική</foreign> is a species of art, in order to proceed with the discussion. The correctness of this statement is brought under question later.
</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ἀγαθόν γε</lemma>: the self-satisfaction of Gorgias is so great that he speaks like a Homeric hero. Note the condescension (perhaps unconscious) in the following <foreign lang="greek">κάλει δή</foreign> (<hi rend="italic">you may call me so, then</hi>), of which, however, Socrates takes no notice.</p><p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">εἰ δή</lemma>: <hi rend="italic">if . . . really.</hi> <pb n="40"/>

</p></div>
<div type="section" n="449b">
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ἄλλοθι</lemma>: on these travels, see Introd. &sect; 5. The vagueness of the adverb stamps the whole statement as somewhat boastful.
</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">τὸ δὲ μῆκος τῶν λόγων</lemma>: Socrates does not mean that the answers should be restricted to a certain length; but he wishes to exclude those answers which, instead of keeping strictly to the question under discussion, branch off and lose themselves in different trains of thought. By using <foreign lang="greek">καί</foreign> before <foreign lang="greek">Πῶλος</foreign>, Socrates gives us to understand that he fears something similar from Gorgias.
</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">εἰσαῦθις ἀποθέσθαι</lemma>: <hi rend="italic">put off till another time.</hi></p><p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ὅπερ ὑπισχνεῖ</lemma>: with reference to <bibl> 447 e</bibl>.
</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">εἰσὶν</lemma> <foreign lang="greek"> κτἑ.</foreign>: though Gorgias speaks like a master, with the air of authority, he would still like to leave a way of escape open for himself, &mdash;which unfortunately his boastful <foreign lang="greek">ἐπάγγελμα</foreign> has rendered impossible, although he had not yet distinctly promised to speak with brevity.
</p></div>
<div type="section" n="449c">
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ἀναγκαῖαι . . . πολεῖσθαι</lemma>: the personal construction proceeds from the &lsquo;prolepsis&rsquo; of the subject of the inf.,&mdash;a common occurrence with <foreign lang="greek">δίκαιος</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">δῆλος</foreign>. The real subject of the infinitive is then <foreign lang="greek">ἐνίας τῶν ἀποκρίσεων</foreign>. Of this construction Plato affords other examples. <title>Cf. Meno</title> 79 d <foreign lang="greek">ἀπόκρισιν τὴν διὰ τῶν ἔτι ζητουμένων . . . ἐπιχειροῦσαν ἀποκρίνεσθαι</foreign>, <title>Phaedo</title> 92 d <foreign lang="greek">τοῖς διὰ τῶν εἰκότων τὰς ἀποδείξεις ποιουμένοις λόγοις</foreign>. In translation the adj. must be made neuter, or a circumlocution must be used. &ldquo;There are certain answers in which it is necessary for one to deliver himself more at length.&rdquo; See H. 944 a; Rid. &sect; 230.
</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">διὰ βραχυτάτων</lemma>: simply a circumlocution for the superlative adv., and accordingly const. with <foreign lang="greek">ὡς</foreign> acc. to the usual rule. Kr. 49, 10, 1; H. 651 a. In the next sent., <foreign lang="greek">ἐν</foreign> seems to have much the same force as <foreign lang="greek">διά</foreign> here.
</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">μηδένα ἂν . . . εἰπεῖν</lemma>: the use of <foreign lang="greek">μή</foreign> here is not to be considered as due <pb n="41"/>  to indir. disc. which would require <foreign lang="greek">οὐ</foreign>, but as being in an inf. clause which is in apposition with <foreign lang="greek">ἕν</foreign>.

<milestone n="4" unit="part"/>
 </p><p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ῥητορικῆς γὰρ</lemma> <foreign lang="greek"> κτἑ.</foreign>: <foreign lang="greek">γάρ</foreign> introduces the reason for the question which is announced in the challenging phrase, <foreign lang="greek">φέρε δή</foreign>. Hence the position of the causal clause.

</p></div>
<div type="section" n="449d">
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">περὶ τί</lemma>: &lsquo;<foreign lang="greek">περί</foreign> with acc., ordinarily of <hi rend="italic">action;</hi> <foreign lang="greek">περί</foreign> with gen., ordinarily of <hi rend="italic">thought</hi> or <hi rend="italic">speech;</hi> but <hi rend="italic">thought</hi> or <hi rend="italic">speech</hi> may be considered as <hi rend="italic">action</hi>, and shifts are not uncommon.&rsquo; B.L.G. Cf. <foreign lang="greek">περὶ τῆς ῥητορικῆς</foreign> below (12).
</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">νὴ τὴν ̔́Ηραν</lemma>: Socrates rarely uses the same oath twice in the same dialogue. Cf. <foreign lang="greek">νὴ τὸν κύνα</foreign> <bibl n="Plat.

</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">πάνυ ἐπιεικῶς</lemma>: <hi rend="italic">fairly well.</hi> In this self-laudation, Gorgias has in view only the form of his answers without reference to their connexion with the subject-matter. He only wants to show that he is a master of brachylogy, and therefore answers in the shortest formulae of affirmation and negation.
</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ἐπιστήμη</lemma>: not really different from <foreign lang="greek">τέχνη</foreign>, inasmuch as the orator is <foreign lang="greek">ἐπιστήμων ῥητορικῆς τέχνης</foreign>. <pb n="42"/>

<div type="section" n="449e">

<p>VII. The scolion was a peculiar kind of drinking-songs, <foreign lang="greek">παροίνια</foreign>,  sung at banquets. The one here alluded to is mentioned by Plato in <title>Euthyd.</title> 279 a, <title>Phileb.</title> 48 d, <title>Legg.</title> 631 c, 661 a. It probably was composed by Simonides, although according to some it was by Epicharmus. After Bergk's (Poet. Lyr. Gr. iii.^{4} 645) rhythmical changes the words acc. to the Scholiast read as follows:

<foreign lang="greek">Ὑγιαίνειν μὲν ἄριστον ἀνδρὶ θνατῷ, δεύτερον δὲ φυὰν καλὸν γενέσθαι, τὸ τρίτον δὲ πλουτεῖν ἀδόλως, καὶ τὸ τέταρτον ἡβᾶν μετὰ τῶν φίλων</foreign>.

</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">καταριθμοῦνται</lemma>: the advantages are arranged according to their value in the enumeration. Instead of an object the clause with <foreign lang="greek">ὅτι</foreign> follows, introducing the dir. discourse.

</p></div>
<div type="section" n="452a">
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">δημιουργοί</lemma>: the word is found as early as Homer and denotes all who carry on a business which is public and useful to the people; as, physicians, soothsayers, singers, goldsmiths. Later, the expression was extended to free manual laborers, without, however, losing any of its respectability. Hence it corresponds to our use of the word &lsquo;master&rsquo; (master-workman, master-mason). Cf. <bibl n="Plat. Gorg. 455b"> 455 b</bibl>. It is noteworthy that only such things are enumerated as, like the assumed result of rhetoric, were reckoned among external advantages; for rhetoric, according to the view of Gorgias, should procure in the state either high office or honors. Hence the scolion is very applicable. Socrates brings forward the physician, the bodytrainer, and the banker, in order to contrast with the subjective judgment  of Gorgias the subjective opinions of others, and thus to show the subjectivity of the answer.

Both the <foreign lang="greek">παιδοτρίβης</foreign> and the <foreign lang="greek">λυμναστής</foreign> are often mentioned alongside of the physician, since the nurture and care of the body was their common aim. <title>Cf.

The first, <foreign lang="greek">τὸ δημηγορικόν</foreign> (<foreign lang="greek">συμβουλευτικόν</foreign>, deliberativum), was employed <foreign lang="greek">ἔν τε τοῖς βουλευτηρίοις καὶ ταῖς ἐκκλησίαις</foreign>.

Zeuxis, the celebrated painter and contemporary of Socrates, was a native of Heraclea in Lower Italy. He was the pupil of Apollodorus, <pb n="53"/>  who, by a more delicate appreciation and application of the principles of light and shade in painting, greatly furthered the development of the art, and obtained for himself the surname of &lsquo;Sciagraph.&rsquo; The paintings of Zeuxis, who belonged to the Ionic school, were noted for their delicacy and fine coloring. Besides the Helena which he painted for the Crotoniates (Cic. <hi rend="italic">de Inv.</hi> ii. 1. 1), his most celebrated picture was the Penelope, wherein he depicted with great success pure matronly modesty. The story of his contest with his rival Parrhasius is well known.
</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ζῷα</lemma>: a general expression for every kind of pictures.
</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">καὶ ποῦ</lemma>: Socrates wishes here to make clear that if we wish to define an object exactly, i.e. so as to make it easily recognizable, it is not sufficient to give the characteristic which it has in common with other objects, but rather it is necessary to mention that characteristic which belongs to it alone and distinguishes it from all other objects. So, for example, it is not sufficient to say that Zeuxis is a painter, i.e. one who either paints or has painted pictures; but in order to distinguish him from other painters, who also paint or have painted pictures, we must state more nearly the kind of pictures which he has painted (<foreign lang="greek">ποῖα</foreign>), as &lsquo;he who painted the Helena or the Penelope.&rsquo; But even this is not entirely sufficient, for  there are still other painters who have painted these same objects; but when we say, &lsquo;he who painted the Helena in Croton (<foreign lang="greek">ποῦ</foreign>),&rsquo; we have definitely defined Zeuxis. <foreign lang="greek">ποῦ</foreign> could also, and more naturally, refer to the scene of his labors,&mdash;where he had his studio. We must note (1) that <foreign lang="greek">ὁ τὰ ζῷα γράφων</foreign> is only the common designation of all painters, by which they are distinguished from the <foreign lang="greek">λόγους</foreign> or <foreign lang="greek">νόμους</foreign> or <foreign lang="greek">συγγράμματα γράφοντες</foreign>, (2) that <foreign lang="greek">ὁ γράφων</foreign> can and must be understood in the same way in which we so often understand <foreign lang="greek">ὁ ἀδικῶν, ὁ κρατῶν</foreign>, etc., i.e. as a generic word, not limited in time (H. 827), (3) that <foreign lang="greek">ποῖος</foreign> is often scarcely to be distinguished from <foreign lang="greek">τίς</foreign> (cf. Xen. <title>Anab.</title> iii. 1. 14 <foreign lang="greek">ἐγὼ οὖν τὸν ἐκ ποίας πόλεως στρατηγὸν προσδοκῶ ταῦτα πράξειν; ποίαν δ’  ἡλικίαν ἐμαυτῷ ἐλθεῖν ἀναμένω</foreign><hi rend="italic">;</hi>). With these points understood, we see that the present example suffices to show that to define rhetoric as <foreign lang="greek">πειθοῦς δημιουργός</foreign>, i.e. <foreign lang="greek">ἡ τὴν πειθὼ ἀπεργαζομένη τέχνη</foreign> is insufficient, so long as the <foreign lang="greek">πειθώ</foreign> wrought by it is not more exactly specified in order to distinguish it from that wrought by other arts which come under the same general definition. Cf. moreover the answer of Gorgias, below, <bibl n="Plat.

<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ἀλλ’  ἵνα</lemma> <foreign lang="greek"> κτἑ.</foreign>: this sentence is a good example of those curious anacolutha which occur so often in the conversation of ordinary life, where a slight emphasis on a single word may perhaps change the whole construction, and cause the speaker to lose <pb n="56"/>  himself in a network of clauses, of which, while the idea is clear enough, the grammatical construction is hopeless. The idea here is this: &ldquo;I thought you meant that, but still I asked; and you must not be surprised if I again ask something which seems to be evident enough; for it is absolutely essential for our argument that we proceed upon definitely expressed statements, and not upon mere suspicions, which may prove to be misunderstandings.&rdquo; In the construction the speaker proceeds well enough until he is thrown off the track by <foreign lang="greek">ἐγὼ δ’  ἐπανερωτῶ</foreign>. The use of this seemingly independent clause (it is really, together with <foreign lang="greek">δοκεῖ μέν</foreign>, in dependence on <foreign lang="greek">ὅ</foreign>) causes him to branch off, in the clause <foreign lang="greek">ὅπερ γὰρ λέγω</foreign>, in order to explain the reason for his repeated questioning, and at  the same time to reiterate one of the fundamental principles of dialectic.

The following passage gives the two leading departments of the physician's profession&mdash;pharmacy, <foreign lang="greek">φάρμακον πιεῖν</foreign>, and surgery, <foreign lang="greek">τεμεῖν ἢ καῦσαι παρασχεῖν</foreign> &mdash;which in ancient times, as is also the case to a large degree at present, were frequently united by the same practitioner. The knife and the cautery, as the two leading instruments of the surgeon's profession, are often mentioned together. Cf. <bibl n="Plat. Gorg. 480c"> 480 c</bibl>, <bibl n="Plat.

<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ὅπῃ βούλει</lemma>: more exactly we should expect <foreign lang="greek">ὅποι</foreign>, and some of the inferior Mss. have it here. But the ideas of &lsquo;where&rsquo; and &lsquo;whither&rsquo; are often confounded in Greek, while in Eng. &lsquo;where&rsquo; has become the rule for &lsquo;whither&rsquo; in ordinary conversation. The remark here is very fitting in the mouth of Gorgias, in view of his extensive travels. Cf. Introd. &sect;&sect; 4, 5.

<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">11</lemma> f. </p><p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">τον εἰπεῖν δυνατόν</lemma>: <foreign lang="greek">λέγειν</foreign> is more usual; but the same difference which exists between <foreign lang="greek">ἔλεγε</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">ἔλεξε</foreign> or <foreign lang="greek">εἶπε</foreign> exists also between their infinitives.

<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ἐν πλήθει</lemma>: though properly much more general in its meaning than <foreign lang="greek">ἐκκλησίᾳ</foreign> or <foreign lang="greek">συλλόγῳ</foreign> used above, is probably employed only for the sake of variety. The distinct and definite statement with which Gorgias closes his characterization (<foreign lang="greek">ἡ μὲν οὖν κτἑ.</foreign>) brings up to his mind the thought that perhaps some might object to the indiscriminate employment of such an art. He is thus led to a defence of it which is so injudicious that it affords the adversary the very best weapons for attack. <pb n="63"/>

</p></div>
<div type="section" n="456d">
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">τῇ ἄλλῃ ἀγωνίᾳ</lemma>: carried away by the excitement of his own thoughts, Gorgias forgets the caution which he had hitherto exercised in his conversation with Socrates, as well as the definition of rhetoric which the two had agreed upon above, and is led to set forth his art quite in the manner of the Sophists (the Eristics), as a means of defence and offence; a weapon which, though it required the use of the mind instead of the body, the lips instead of the arms, was no less a department of the science of fighting than boxing or the other exercises of the soldier. Some Sophists &mdash;i.e. Euthydemus and Dionysodorus &mdash;were at the same time teachers of fencing. Boxing, <foreign lang="greek">πυκτεύειν</foreign>, which, in connexion with <foreign lang="greek">παλαίειν</foreign>, or wrestling, formed the <foreign lang="greek">παγκρατιάζειν</foreign>, went beyond the range of ordinary gymnastics, and belonged to the peculiar art of the athletes. Fighting in full armor (<foreign lang="greek">ὁπλομαχία</foreign>) was not followed as  a profession until after the Peloponnesian War. As in all these exercises, so in rhetoric the great object was not public, but private, not advantage to the community, but advancement for the individual.

<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ἔμαθε</lemma>: the unexpressed subject, as of <foreign lang="greek">χρῆσθαι</foreign>, is the indefinite &lsquo;one.&rsquo;

<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">φοιτήσας</lemma>: <foreign lang="greek">φοιτᾶν</foreign> is the regular word for attendance at a school; hence <foreign lang="greek">φοιτητής</foreign>, a &lsquo;scholar.&rsquo;</p><p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">εὖ ἔχων τὸ σῶμα</lemma>: not merely by the gift of nature, but also, as <foreign lang="greek">πυκτικὸς γενόμενος</foreign>, by education.

Had it been present originally in Socrates' mind, he would have said <foreign lang="greek">μὴ ὀρθῶς ἢ κτἑ.</foreign>; but not being present, the negative was attracted to the verb of saying, by the regular Greek rule. Looking at it in this light, it is not necessary (with Cron) to supply a <pb n="66"/>  second <foreign lang="greek">φῇ</foreign> from the preceding <foreign lang="greek">μὴ φῇ</foreign>, which would hardly come under the head of the simple following the compound.</p><p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">χαλεπαίνουσι</lemma>: the pl. occurs here as it did with <foreign lang="greek">ἀμφισβητήσωσιν</foreign> above, because from <foreign lang="greek">ὁ ἕτερος τὸν ἕτερον</foreign> we naturally draw the idea &ldquo;both.&rdquo; Cf. in Latin, Cic. <hi rend="italic">de Fin.</hi> iii. 2. 8 quod cum accidisset, ut <hi rend="italic">alter alterum</hi> necopinato <hi rend="italic">videremus</hi>, etc., and the expression for &lsquo;both&rsquo; in the Romance languages.&mdash; The use of the pronouns throughout this long sentence is both interesting and instructive; <foreign lang="greek">ἀλλήλους, ἑαυτούς, ἕτερος, ἕτερον, ἑαυτῶν, σφῶν αὐτῶν</foreign> (bis). The distinction between reciprocal and reflexive is sometimes very narrow.

In the present case this is paralleled by <foreign lang="greek">τοῦ</foreign> with the infin.,&mdash;one of the many Greek modes of expressing finality (H. 960; GMT. 798). With <foreign lang="greek">πρὸς σέ</foreign> also the main idea of the <foreign lang="greek">πρός</foreign> is that of <hi rend="italic">hostile</hi> purpose; the hostility, however, does not lie in the <foreign lang="greek">πρὸς</foreign>, but in the general tone. In a certain sense <foreign lang="greek">φιλονικεῖν</foreign> might also be applied to Socrates, as his search for truth was a continual struggle throughout his whole life.

<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ἡδέως ἂν ἐλεγξάντων . . . λέγοι</lemma>:   of these two conditional clauses the first is logical, the second ideal. The present conversation is a practical example of Socrates' view; hence the logical conditional form is used for the practical present case. The rest of the sentence follows naturally in the opt. as being rather theoretical, and applicable to some other time than the present. The participles represent the same tenses of the optatives.

</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">οὐδὲν</lemma> <foreign lang="greek"> κτἑ.</foreign>: Socrates was convinced that correct views determine the will and actions, and that sin and error are due to lack of knowledge.

The asyndeton with <foreign lang="greek">ἔπειτα</foreign> instead of <foreign lang="greek">κἄπειτα</foreign> (cf. <title>Apol.</title> 23 c) is not uncommon, and the clause is to be construed in dependence on <foreign lang="greek">ὅτι</foreign> (<hi rend="italic">because</hi>). By this time, however, Polus' flow of words has run away with him; he has only energy enough  left to hurl at Socrates the words <foreign lang="greek">τοῦθ’  ὃ δὴ ἀγαπᾷς</foreign>, before he abandons his struggling sentence altogether and starts afresh.

Hence he receives a sharp rap over the knuckles with the admonition that his question had been some time settled <bibl n="plat. gorg. 465d">(465 d</bibl>).
</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">τί τάχα δράσεις</lemma>: is taken by Cron to mean &ldquo;what can you possibly (<foreign lang="greek">τάχα</foreign>) bring forward?&rdquo; i.e. in the course of the discussion. The scholiast understood it as meaning &ldquo;what will you do presently,&rdquo; when you get old, as we see by the addition <foreign lang="greek">πρεσβύτης γενόμενος</foreign>. Probably it is  but an exclamation of wonder and surprise; our colloquial &ldquo;What'll you do next?&rdquo;
</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ἐν ταῖς πόλεσι</lemma>: is to be connected with <foreign lang="greek">φαῦλοι νομίζεσθαι</foreign>. In spite of his qualification, Polus proceeds to put as bad a color on his assumed view of Socrates as possible, by adding <foreign lang="greek">ἀγαθοί</foreign> (cf. <bibl n="Plat. Gorg. 449a"> 449 a</bibl>) to <foreign lang="greek">ῥήτορες</foreign>. Cf. <bibl n="Plat. Gorg. 469a"> 469 a</bibl>. He does not aim at a refutation of Socrates; with him the question is still not the true nature of Rhetoric, but its value and power in the state.
</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ἐρώτημα</lemma> <foreign lang="greek"> κτἑ.</foreign>: probably Socrates only wishes to show that, from the point of view of dialectic, the preceding question is so inappropriate that he is obliged to look upon it as a merely <hi rend="italic">rhetorical</hi> one, by which Polus only states his own sentiments.

The facts brought forward by Polus in their darkest colors are probably correct; but Archelaus laid the foundation for the later importance of Macedonia by introducing Greek culture.

These are both external demands on the criminal, called forth by his crime, and by which an expiation of it is to be effected. On the other hand, <foreign lang="greek">κόλασις</foreign> is the discipline which the guilty party himself undergoes, designed to prevent further transgression; while <foreign lang="greek">ζημία</foreign> <bibl n="plat. gorg. 470a">(470 a</bibl>) is only the injury or damage which he sustains in expiating his crime.

By inviting Socrates to put the question to those present, he reminds him of the analogous practice of <foreign lang="greek">ἐπιψηφίζειν</foreign> (rogare populum), and gives him a chance to plead his own inaptitude as an excuse for not employing rhetorical methods.  Socrates in his reply also shows that to accept the opinion of the majority &mdash;the method which the state had settled upon as the best way of establishing the truth&mdash;was as unsatisfactory, when employed by the individual, as the rhetorical methods. The fact to which Socrates alludes is the well-known trial of the generals who had won the battle of Arginusae and afterwards fell victims to political intrigue. The full proceedings are detailed by Xen. <title>Hell.</title> i. 6. 33 ff. and 7. Socrates was senator this year (Ol. 93. 3, 406 B.C.), and in the memorable assembly <foreign lang="greek">ἐπιστάτης τῶν πρυτάνεων</foreign>.

<p>XXXVII. On the role assigned to Callicles here, see Introd. &sect; 15. After Polus has shown himself in capable of maintaining his views of rhetoric against the superior dialectical skill of Socrates, Callicles enters the discussion with a thought quite similar to the one with which Polus had entered it in <bibl n="Plat. Gorg. 461b"> 461 b</bibl>. The view of life on which all of Socrates' deductions rest is so abhorrent to his innermost nature and all his hitherto cherished ideas that he cannot be brought to look upon the principles here advocated as the earnest convictions of a reasonable man. He does not, however, rush into the lists so roughly as Polus, but, being a more polished man of the world, turns first to Chaerephon, who is thoroughly acquainted with Socrates' views. He, however, wittily refers him to the master, in the same words with which Callicles himself had in <bibl n="Plat. Gorg. 447c"> 447 c</bibl> referred Socrates to Gorgias. <pb n="132"/>

Artistically also his words form the text for the discussion which follows.

 </p><p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">νεανιεύεσθαι</lemma>: &ldquo;to act like a wild young man.&rdquo; Callicles has in mind especially the insolent, bold, and reckless conduct of the rich and proud Athenian youth.

The verb applies especially to the training of the youth by the Sophists, which leads them to light and idle speeches and to a defense of the most conflicting principles without having regard unto the higher and earnest problems of life. <title>Cf.

Here Callicles probably wants to indicate the vulgarity of such illustrations and talks, as being fit only for the uncultured multitude. The rel. sentence <foreign lang="greek">ἃ φύσει κτἑ.</foreign> is connected epexegetically with <foreign lang="greek">τοιαῦτα</foreign>, and thereby the conclusion from the special case is made of general application.

In this <foreign lang="greek">νόμος ὁ πάντων βασιλεύς</foreign> Pindar may be thinking of the power of that <hi rend="italic">fate</hi> which is superior even to the gods themselves. &mdash;Geryones, son of Chrysaor (&ldquo;lightning&rdquo;) and the Oceanid Callirhoe (&ldquo;beautiful stream&rdquo;), was a giant with three bodies and three heads. He lived with his dog Orthros, or Orthos, on the fertile island Erytheia, and possessed great herds of cattle. These were stolen from him by Hercules in the expedition celebrated in the story. Cf.

<milestone n="41" unit="section"/></p>
<p>After this general presentation of his views of philosophy, Callicles now proceeds to make a special application to Socrates' case, with apparent personal good-will, it is true, but still with the condescending mien of the superior man of the world.

<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">2</lemma> f. </p><p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ὅπερ ὁ Ζῆθος πρὸς τὸν Ἀμφίονα</lemma>: the omission of <foreign lang="greek">πρὸς σέ</foreign> is hardly felt. Callicles cleverly illustrates his exposition of the opposition between the principles of practical life and this theoretical philosophizing by reference again to the already cited <title>Antiope</title> of Euripides. Antiope had borne to Zeus twin sons, Amphion and Zethus, but was afterwards taken by her uncle Lycus to Thebes, where she suffered for a long time the most cruel treatment at the hands of Ly<pb n="147"/>  cus' wife, Dirce. Meanwhile, her sons were being brought up by a herdsman in the forest. Amphion devoted himself entirely to music, while the active and restless Zethus spent his time in hunting and the care of his herds. Finally Antiope escapes from her prison, and hurries to her sons. Dirce pursues, overtakes her, and is just in the act of having her bound to a wild steer, when the sons, who had been informed of their parentage by the herdsman, appear on the scene, rescue their mother from the hands of Dirce, and bind her to the steer instead. Dirce was then changed into a fountain. Amphion and Zethus attain the sovereignty in Thebes, and fortify it with walls. In this work Zethus contributed his great bodily strength, while Amphion's lyre drew after him the stones. This difference in character as related in the myth (Apollod. iii. 5. 5 <foreign lang="greek">Ζῆθος μὲν οὖν ἐπεμελεῖτο βουφορβίων, Ἀμφίων δὲ κιθαρῳδίαν ἤσκει</foreign>) suggested to Euripides a dialogue between the brothers, wherein each praises his own calling to the disparagement of the other's. Callicles applies Euripides' words to the opposition between political and philosophical activity.
</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">5</lemma> f. The words of Euripides are  given by Nauck. <title>Eur. frag.</title>^{2} 185, as follows:&mdash;

. . . <foreign lang="greek">ἀμελεῖς, ὧν σε φροντίζειν ἐχρῆν· ψυχῆς ἔχων γὰρ ὧδε γενναίαν φύσιν γυναικομίμῳ διαπρέπεις μορφώματι· . . . κοὔτ’  ἂν ἀσπίδος κύτει ὀρθῶς ὁμιλήσειας οὔτ̓ ἄλλων ὕπερ νεανικὸν βούλευμα βουλεύσαιό τι</foreign>.

Yet these lines do not contain all that seems poetical in this passage. In place of <foreign lang="greek">γυναικομίμῳ</foreign> Callicles naturally, from his point of view, uses <foreign lang="greek">μειρακιώδει</foreign>, which is quite different from <foreign lang="greek">νεανικός</foreign> in its meaning (<hi rend="italic">boyish</hi>).

Callicles closes with a further citation from the <title>Antiope</title>, which Nauck, Fr. 188, gives thus:&mdash;

<foreign lang="greek">ἀλλ’  ἐμοὶ πιθοῦ</foreign>  <foreign lang="greek">παῦσαι μελῳδῶν, πολεμίων δ’  εὐμουσίαν ἄσκει· τοιαῦτ̓ ἄειδε καὶ δόξεις φρονεῖν, σκάπτων, ἀρῶν γῆν, ποιμνίοις ἐπιστατῶν, ἄλλοις τὰ κομψὰ ταῦτ̓ ἀφεὶς σοφίσματα, ἐξ ὧν κενοῖσιν ἐγκατοικήσεις δόμοις</foreign>.
</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ἐλέγχων</lemma>: is probably, like the corresponding word in the quotation, to be considered as a verb, since the contrast lies not in a single word, but in the whole following clause. Similarly Thrasymachus says, <title>Rep.</title> i. 336 c, <foreign lang="greek">μηδὲ φιλοτιμοῦ ἐλέγχων</foreign>. The verb, used absolutely, designates the kind of philosophical activity which Socrates has just practised against Polus. Cf. <bibl n="Plat. Gorg. 472b"> 472 b</bibl>.
</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">εὐμουσίαν</lemma>: was appropriate in Zethus' speech, as he wished to show his brother wherein the <foreign lang="greek">εὐμουσία</foreign>, which he sought in <foreign lang="greek">κιθαρῳδία</foreign>, was really to be found; less so in Callicles', who probably is thinking rather of <foreign lang="greek">εὐβουλία</foreign>. The contrast to <foreign lang="greek">φρονεῖν</foreign> would be <foreign lang="greek">ληρεῖν</foreign> or <foreign lang="greek">φλυαρεῖν</foreign>.

Now that Callicles has stated exactly the manner in which he looks at life, Socrates proceeds to contrast that view with his own, not directly <pb n="167"/> indeed, but by a series of comparisons and similes, which serve the double purpose of calming the feelings of the listeners and readers after the impassioned speech of Callicles and, by presenting these pictures to the fancy, of preparing their minds for the following dialectical argument.

For his present purpose two are sufficient,&mdash;the really spiritual, the reason, and that part which clings greedily to the body; for the question to be decided is: Shall life be directed according to the nature of the soul or of the body?

Hence Plato applies it also, in <title>Phaedo</title> 69 c and <title>Theaet.</title> 155 e, to those who have not been initiated into wisdom, or Philosophy, which causes&mdash;as the mysteries were also designed to do&mdash;an actual inner purification of the soul.

What is to be understood here by choruses is explained by the addition <foreign lang="greek">ἡ διθυράμβων ποίησις</foreign>. It is not all <hi rend="italic">choric</hi> lyric which is condemned, but only that part of it which from its connexion with the Dionysus cult had found entrance into Athens and had there been much fostered by the state, which entrusted both native and foreign musicians with the arrangement and production of the dithyramb at the Dionysiac festivals, where contests (<foreign lang="greek">ἀγῶνες</foreign>) took place in it. The  founder of dithyrambic melic was the just-named Arion of Methymne (B.C. 600), who resided at the court of Periander of Corinth. He was said to have introduced the <hi rend="italic">strophic</hi> arrangement, and the so-called <hi rend="italic">cyclic</hi> chorus (consisting of fifty members), which was thus named because the chorus was arranged in a circle around the altar. The second period of the dithyramb begins with the settling in Athens of Lasus of Hermione, a contemporary of the Pisistratidae and a teacher of Pindar. But it soon degenerated in Athens by excessive over-refinement and fantastic cultivation, until it received a new impulse towards the end of the Peloponnesian war by the more artistic cultivation of the dramatic and musical elements by Philoxenus of Cythera.

And he succeeded in a way, for he was ridiculed by the comic <pb n="195"/>  poets Strattis (who composed a comedy upon him), Plato Comicus, and also Aristophanes in the <title>Clouds</title> and the <title>Frogs</title>, as a sinner against art and taste,&mdash;one of those who are called in <title>Nub.</title> 333 <foreign lang="greek">κυκλίων χορῶν ᾀσματοκάμπται</foreign>.

<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">τὸ τοῦ Ἐπιχάρμου</lemma>: Epicharmus was a native of Cos, but early went to Sicily (Megara) and devoted himself there to the study of medicine and philosophy, especially the Pythagorean and Empedoclean. But his claim to fame rests on his comedies. He stands at the head of the Sicilian comic poets, being noted for the ethical nature of his poetry. It was full of sententious sayings, and thereby aroused Plato's interest to the highest degree. He flourished during the Persian war, under the government of Gelo. The verse here cited reads, according to Athenaeus:

<foreign lang="greek">τὰ πρὸ τοῦ δύ̓ ἄνδρες ἔλεγον</foreign>

<foreign lang="greek">εἷς ἐγὼν ἀποχρέω</foreign> (i.e. <foreign lang="greek">ἀποχράω</foreign>, <title>I am sufficient.</title>

Socrates means that he is himself assuming a burden which according to the nature of the matter requires two. The answer is in construction connected with the question of Callicles in order to disclose for the others' consideration the doubtful side, as it were, of such a demand. With this  the following <foreign lang="greek">ἀτάρ</foreign> (<hi rend="italic">however</hi>) agrees.

The article with <foreign lang="greek">ἀληθές</foreign> is due to its position. We should also have in like manner <foreign lang="greek">τὸ ψεῦδος</foreign>, did it precede <foreign lang="greek">τί ἐστιν</foreign>.

Thompson supposes, with some probability, that <foreign lang="greek">σώματα</foreign> refers to the other members of the passenger's family, who may be conceived as belonging to him. Perhaps &ldquo;goods and chattels&rdquo; may be as good a rendering as any.

<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">προσεσταλμένη</lemma>: &ldquo;retired,&rdquo; i.e. unpretending.

Since both leading clauses are hypothetical, we have a double employment of <foreign lang="greek">μέν</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">δέ</foreign>. The first member of the antithesis is given first only for the sake of the contrast; we should use a subordinate clause in English, and lay the most stress on the second member, and, too, on its conclusion. <title>Cf.

If the <foreign lang="greek">ἐστί</foreign> is to be construed rigidly with <foreign lang="greek">μή</foreign>, understanding again <foreign lang="greek">ὅρα</foreign>, then we must consider that Socrates rejected the subjv., which may refer either to the present or the future, for the indic., which leaves no ambiguity as to its time sphere.

At the time of Demosthenes the continuance of the <foreign lang="greek">θεωρικόν</foreign> was especially injurious, because the means for military purposes were thereby greatly curtailed. Plato's criticism of Pericles was always unfavorable, which, however, is not to be wondered at, since his youth fell during the years of Athenian depression, which the oligarchy ascribed to the mistakes of the great democratical leader.&mdash; </p><p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">μισθοφορίαν</lemma>: on the growth and effects of this policy at Athens and elsewhere, see Grote, Hist. xi. 281 (c. lxxxvii.).

Themistocles was banished in  B.C. 471, and went to Argos.

The distinction between <foreign lang="greek">λόγος</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">μῦθος</foreign>, which are often contrasted, is that <foreign lang="greek">λόγος</foreign> is said of the true and the actual; <foreign lang="greek">μῦθος</foreign>, of the fictitious. By this distinction Socrates wishes to call attention to the fact that a truth lies at the basis of the following myth, while the dress of it is a matter of indifference,&mdash;not that he actually believes the story as it stands. In this light we must also consider <pb n="258"/>  his statement <foreign lang="greek">ὡς ἀληθῆ κτἑ.</foreign>, looking to his explanation in <title>Phaedo</title> 114 d <foreign lang="greek">τὸ μὲν οὖν ταῦτα διισχυρίσασθαι οὕτως ἔχειν ὡς ἐγὼ διελήλυθα, οὐ πρέπει νοῦν ἔχοντι ἀνδρί, ὅτι μέντοι ἢ ταῦτ’  ἐστὶν ἢ τοιαῦτ̓ ἄττα περὶ τὰς ψυχὰς ἡμῶν καὶ τὰς οἰκήσεις, ἐπεί περ ἀθάνατόν γε ἡ ψυχὴ φαίνεται οὖσα, τοῦτο καὶ πρέπειν μοι δοκεῖ καὶ ἄξιον κινδυνεῦσαι οἰομένῳ οὕτως ἔχειν</foreign>.

<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">3</lemma> f. </p><p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ὥσπερ Ὅμηρος λέγει</lemma>: Socrates refers to O 187 ff., where Poseidon says:&mdash;

<foreign lang="greek">γαῖα δ’  ἔτι ξυνὴ πάντων καὶ μακρὸς Ὄλυμπος</foreign>.

Socrates commences with this passage so as to be able to assume therefrom an empire of the dead, or the existence of the soul after death, as an admitted fact which requires no proof.

The first mention of the <title>Islands</title> of the Blessed is found in Hesiod (<foreign lang="greek">ἔργα κ. ἡ.</foreign> 170), who makes them the place to which the men of the fourth race, the heroes and chieftains of the Trojan war are sent <hi rend="italic">after death</hi> as their reward.

The myth is then further developed, and the Isles of the Blessed become gradually in the common belief, largely through Pindar's influence, the abode of all the righteous after death. Cf.

Plato alone makes it the prison of <hi rend="italic">all</hi> wrong-doers. The term <foreign lang="greek">μακάρων νήσους</foreign> became stereotyped very early; hence we never find the prose word <foreign lang="greek">μακαρίων</foreign> used in it.

</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ζῶντες ἦσαν ζώντων</lemma>: this pres entation is quite in harmony with the mythical form which Socrates adopts. The object is to show the contrast between a judgment which is human, uncertain, and based on external appearances, and the true one, which is based on accurate inspection of the unveiled truth. For this purpose the human tribunal is supposed in the myth to have existed first; the second tribunal is then made by Plato to <hi rend="italic">arise</hi> as a substitute for the first, although naturally it must be conceived as existent ever since the creation of man. The first tribunal admits of the same criticism as the one in use among men deserves.
</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">οἱ ἐπιμεληταί</lemma>: who these are remains uncertain.

The soul is not susceptible of improvement, being perfect at the outset; but lack of care will, just as in the case of the body, subject the soul to the influence of outside forces.

<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ἅ</lemma>: refers to both the previously named conditions; see on <foreign lang="greek">ταῦτα</foreign> above, d. Socrates shows us the immoral condition of the soul under three aspects: 1. The vital principle of morality is <foreign lang="greek">δικαιοσύνη</foreign>, hence <foreign lang="greek">ἀδικία</foreign> is placed first. Beside this, as its worst form, stands perjury, the punishment of which after death was assumed even in the Homeric age; cf. <foreign lang="greek">Γ</foreign> 278, T 259 <foreign lang="greek">Ἐρινύες, αἵ θ’  ὑπὸ γαῖαν</foreign> &verbar; <foreign lang="greek">ἀνθρώπους τίνυνται ὅ τις κ’  ἐπίορκον ὀμόσσῃ. ἀδικία</foreign> accordingly <hi rend="italic">corrupts the very nature itself</hi> of the soul. 2. The natural <hi rend="italic">development</hi> of the soul depends upon its knowledge of the <hi rend="italic">truth.</hi> Lies restrict that development, and hence warp and twist the soul. This image at the same time corresponds to the  familiar view of the nature of truth. 3. Since the activity of the soul is from within outwards, there is need of fixed, definite <hi rend="italic">limits.</hi> If this quality &mdash;<foreign lang="greek">σωφροσύνη</foreign>&mdash;is lacking, or rather if it lapses into <foreign lang="greek">ἀκολασία</foreign>, which according to its surrounding conditions appears as <foreign lang="greek">ἐξουσία, τρυφή</foreign>, and <foreign lang="greek">ὕβρις</foreign> (<foreign lang="greek">ἀκρατία</foreign> is a general term, applicable to all forms), then the proper relation between the <hi rend="italic">separate parts</hi> of the soul is destroyed, and its <hi rend="italic">form</hi> as a whole becomes unsymmetrical and ugly. One naturally thinks of the extension which the <foreign lang="greek">ἐπιθυμίαι</foreign> strive for.
