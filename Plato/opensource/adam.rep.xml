            Euphorion and Panaetius. As Cicero was tolerably familiar with the writings of
            Panaetius, it is possible that he too has the same story in view in <title lang="la">de

          <p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">τῇ θεῷ</lemma>. What goddess? Bendis or Athena?
            The festival is the Bendideia (354 A) and it is perhaps safest to acquiesce in the usual
            view that Bendis is here meant. &ldquo;Alii Minervam intelligunt, quae vulgo

            commercial purposes in the Piraeus, which at all times contained a large admixture of
            foreign population. It was part of Athenian policy to encourage commercial settlers by
            allowing them to exercise their own cults (Foucart <title lang="fr">des assoc. relig.
              chez les Grecs</title> p. 131). Foucart holds that the worship of the Thracian goddess
            Bendis was brought to the Piraeus by Thracian merchants (p. 84). Others have supposed
            that <foreign lang="greek">οἱ Θρᾷκες</foreign> refers to envoys from Thrace, or
            Thracian mercenaries, the survivors of those who came to Athens in 414 B.C. (Thuc. VII
            27); but the other view is more probable.</p>

              <foreign lang="greek">λαμπάς</foreign> was used for &lsquo;torch&rsquo; even
            in classical Greek. Plato chooses <foreign lang="greek">λαμπάδιον</foreign> because he
            has just used <foreign lang="greek">λαμπάς</foreign> in a different sense.</p>
          <p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">διαδωσουσιν κτλ.</lemma> shews that&mdash;except
            for the novel substitution of mounted competitors for runners&mdash;the torch-race
            in question was of the kind alluded to in Hdt. VIII 98 and elsewhere as held in honour
            of Hephaestus. The competition was not between one individual and another, but between
            different lines of competitors, the torch being passed on from man to man. Victory fell
            to the chain whose torch, still burning, first reached the goal. The well-known figure
            in <title>Laws</title> 776 B <foreign lang="greek">καθάπερ λαμπάδα τὸν βίον
              παραδιδόντας ἄλλοις ἐξ ἄλλων</foreign> refers to the same form of race. Plato
            nowhere mentions the simpler form described by Pausanias (1 30. 2), in which individuals
            contended against each other: see Baumeister <hi rend="italic">Denkm&auml;ler d. kl.

          <p>328B - 328E The scene at the house of Polemarchus. Socrates begins to interrogate
            Cephalus on the subject of old age.</p>
          <p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">εἰς τοῦ Πολεμάρχου</lemma>. Polemarchus was older
            than Lysias (infra 331 D), and we are to infer that at this time Cephalus lived with
            him. There is no reason why we should (with Blass <title>Att. Ber.</title> p. 338)
            reject Plato's statement that Polemarchus had a house in the Piraeus: the words of
            Lysias (12. 16), which Blass relies upon as shewing that Polemarchus lived not in the
            Piraeus, but in Athens, refer to 404 B.C. and do not prove it even for that year. Lysias
            probably lived at this time in a house of his own in the Piraeus, as in 404 B.C. (<bibl n="Lys. 12.8">Lys. 12. 8</bibl>): it is to be noted that he is mentioned along with
            the visitors, in contrast with Cephalus (<foreign lang="greek">ἦν δ’ ἔνδον κτλ.
              τεθυκὼς γὰρ ἐτύγχανεν ἐν τῇ αὐλῇ</foreign> infra C). Cf. Boeckh

            raro <hi rend="italic">sane</hi> domum nostram frequentas&rdquo;; but his equation

            coheres closely with the emphatic <foreign lang="greek">σοῦ</foreign>. Others have

              <title>Od.</title> V 88 <foreign lang="greek">πάρος γε μὲν οὔ τι
            θαμίζεις</foreign>), <foreign lang="greek">οὐ δέ</foreign> (Nitzsch), or <foreign lang="greek">οὐ δή</foreign> (Hartman). <foreign lang="greek">οὔ τι</foreign> is
            very unlikely; for <foreign lang="greek">θαμίζω</foreign> is not exclusively a poetic
            word (cf. <title>Laws</title> 843 B), and we need not suppose that Plato is thinking of
            Homer. I agree with Hartman that <foreign lang="greek">οὐ δέ</foreign> is improbable:
              <foreign lang="greek">δέ</foreign> is not sufficiently explained by saying that it is
            &ldquo;adversative to the idea contained in <foreign lang="greek">ἠσπάζετο</foreign>&rdquo; (J. and C., with Schneider <title>Additamenta</title>

            deride a charge to which you at once plead guilty (<foreign lang="greek">γέγονα

If Socrates' question had been not <foreign lang="greek">πότεροντὰ πλείω παρέλαβες ἢ ἐπεκτήσω</foreign>, but <foreign lang="greek">ποῖα ἐπεκτήσω</foreign>, Cephalus would have said <foreign lang="greek">ὁποῖα ἐπεκτησάμην</foreign>: but this idiom is inadmissible, except
            where the same interrogative occurs in its direct form in the original question. In view
            of the answer (<foreign lang="greek">μέσος τις κτλ.</foreign>) which Cephalus gives,
              <foreign lang="greek">πόσα</foreign> for <foreign lang="greek">ποῖα</foreign> would
            be too precise. Of the various emendations which have been suggested, the only plausible

              <foreign lang="greek">ποῖ̓</foreign> or <foreign lang="greek">ποῖ</foreign>: this
            would assimilate the original and the repeated question, but is less well adapted to
            Cephalus' reply. Cephalus in point of fact uses an old man's privilege and accommodates
            his interrogator's question to his own reply. See also V 465 E note</p>

            over-much <foreign lang="greek">προθυμία</foreign> always struck the Greeks as
            laughable: cf. e.g. <bibl n="Eur. Ion 1172">Eur. <title>Ion</title> 1172</bibl> ff. The

              κληρονόμος</foreign> are also somewhat more appropriate if the title was self-chosen.
            Cephalus leaves the argument to be carried on by the assembled company (for <foreign lang="greek">ὑμῖν</foreign> does not mean Polemarchus and Socrates alone): whereupon
            Polemarchus, seizing hold on the word <foreign lang="greek">παραδίδωμι</foreign> in its

          <p>331E - 332B The second half of the definition of Justice which Socrates deduced from
            Cephalus' remarks is now taken up and discussed in the form in which it was expressed by
            Simonides&mdash; &lsquo;rendering to each man his due.&rsquo; In the present
            section Socrates confines himself to eliciting the meaning of &lsquo;due.&rsquo;
            As between friends, it is something good; as between enemies, something evil; in general
            terms it is that which is suitable or appropriate. Simonides in fact meant that Justice
            consists in doing good to friends and ill to foes.</p>
          <p>ff. By <foreign lang="greek">δικαιοσύνη</foreign>, it should be noted, is here meant
            man's whole duty to his fellows, as <foreign lang="greek">ὁσιότης</foreign> is right
            conduct in relation to the gods. In this wide sense the word was commonly understood by
            the Greeks (cf. Theog. 147 <foreign lang="greek">ἐν δὲ δικαιοσύνῃ συλλήβδην πᾶς’
              ἀρετὴ ἔνι</foreign>); and even in the scientific study of ethics, the word still
            retained the same wider connotation, side by side with its more specific meanings
            (Arist. <title>Eth. Nic.</title> v 3. 1129^{b} 11 ff.). The view that Justice consists
            in doing good to friends and harm to enemies, is a faithful reflection of prevalent
            Greek morality (Luthardt <title>Die Antike Ethik</title> p. 19). It is put into the
            mouth of Simonides as a representative of the poets, on whose writings the young were
            brought up: cf. <bibl n="Plat. Prot. 316D"><title>Prot.</title> 316 D</bibl>, 325 E, 338

            6. 35. These references, which might easily be multiplied, shew that Plato is not, as

            refuting Xenophon, but rather criticising an all but universal view. See

            is raised in protest, as by Pittacus (according to D. L. I 4. 78) in the memorable words

            Plato was the first Greek who systematically protested against the doctrine, and
            supported his protest with arguments drawn from a loftier view of man's nature and work.

            responsibility of the explanation on Polemarchus alone. Probably Simonides (if the
            saying is his) meant no more than that we should &lsquo;render unto Caesar the
            things which are Caesar's.&rsquo; Plato virtually confesses in 332 B that his

              those who seem to us good and bad, not those who are so. But as bad men often seem to
              us good and good men bad, Justice will often consist in benefiting bad men, and
              harming good, i.e. in wronging those who do no wrong; or conversely, if we refuse to
              accept this conclusion, and hold that it is just to benefit the just and hurt the
              unjust, it will often be just to hurt friends and benefit enemies, viz. when our

              unjust, and afterwards by means of similar analogical reasoning, that no one can be
              made more unjust by one who is just. Simonides' saying, if Polemarchus has explained

          <p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">φυλάξασθαι κτλ.</lemma> See cr. n. With the

Thus the predicate of each step in the argument
            corresponds to the subject of the step next following: for <foreign lang="greek">λαθεῖν

            Polemarchus' theory indeed points to a division of men into three classes: friends,
            enemies, and those who are neither (viz. those who seem good and are bad, and those who
            seem bad and are good). The somewhat ideal view that the <foreign lang="greek">ἀγαθός</foreign> is <foreign lang="greek">φίλος</foreign> and the <foreign lang="greek">πονηρὸς ἐχθρός</foreign> is genuinely Socratic (cf.
            <title>Mem.</title> II 6. 14 ff.): it is part of the wider view that all men desire the

            The late expression <foreign lang="greek">Φαίδων ἢ περὶ ψυχῆς</foreign> involves
            essentially the same use of <foreign lang="greek">ἤ</foreign>. .The clause <foreign lang="greek">ὡσκακῶς</foreign> is summed up in <foreign lang="greek">τούτῳ</foreign>, and the whole sentence means: &lsquo;do you wish us to make an

            and second that the good man cannot harm others: the Socratic conception of right
            conduct as an art is still predominant. It is important to observe that it was by means

            Teichm&uuml;ller (<title>Lit. Fehd.</title> I p. 22 note) finds in this an allusion
            to Xenophon, who puts into the mouth of Socrates (addressing Critobulus in
            <title>Mem.</title> II 6. 35) the words <foreign lang="greek">ἔγνωκας ἀνδρὸς
              ἀρετὴν εἶναι, νικᾶν τοὺς μὲν φίλους εὖ ποιοῦντα, τοὺς δὲ ἐχθροὺς

              <foreign lang="greek">νοεῖ</foreign> are used in a general way, because such a theory
            and such an interpretation of it might be held by any one at any time: in <foreign lang="greek">οὐκ ἦν σοφὸς ὁ ταῦτα εἰπών</foreign> the time is changed to the
            past to suggest <foreign lang="greek">οὐκ ἦν Σιμωνίδης ὁ ταῦτα εἰπών</foreign>
            (Simonides being <foreign lang="greek">σοφός</foreign> 331 E). But for <foreign lang="greek">ὁ ταῦτα εἰπών, ἦν</foreign> would be <foreign lang="greek">ἐστι</foreign>. It is a mistake to take <foreign lang="greek">ἦν</foreign> as
            &lsquo;is after all&rsquo;: <foreign lang="greek">ἦν</foreign> is hardly so
            used in Plato without <foreign lang="greek">ἄρα</foreign>, nor is <bibl n="Plat. Phaedrus 230A"><title>Phaedr.</title> 230 A</bibl> (cited by Goodwin

            not appear in the list of the seven wise men in <bibl n="Plat. Prot. 343A"><title>Prot.</title> 343 A</bibl>. The expedition of Xerxes against Greece is cited
            by Callicles in <bibl n="Plat. Gorg. 483D"><title>Gorg.</title> 483 D</bibl> in
            connexion with the doctrine that might is right. In <foreign lang="greek">Περδίκκου</foreign> the allusion is to Perdiccas II, father of Archelaus (<bibl n="Plat. Gorg. 471B"><title>Gorg.</title> 471 B</bibl>): he died late in 414 or early
            in 413, three years before the probable date of action of the <title>Republic</title>
              (<title>Introd.</title> &sect; 3), after proving himself a fickle friend and foe
            to the Athenians during the Peloponnesian war. Ismenias is mentioned again in <bibl n="Plat. Meno 90A"><title>Men.</title> 90 A</bibl> as having become rich <foreign lang="greek">δόντος τινός&lt;&gt; νῦν νεωστὶ εἰληφὼς τὰ
              Πολυκράτους χρήματα</foreign>. There can be no doubt that he is to be identified
            with the Ismenias who (see <bibl n="Xen. Hell. 3.5.1">Xen. <title>Hell.</title> III 5.
            1</bibl>) in 395 took money from Timocrates the Rhodian, envoy of the Persian King, in
            order to stir up war against Sparta, and who in 382, when the Spartans had seized the
            Cadmea, was condemned on this charge among others (<bibl n="Xen. Hell. 5.2.35">Xen.
                <title>Hell.</title> V 2. 35</bibl>; Plut. <title>Pelop.</title> 5. 2). Plato
            implies that Ismenias kept enough Persian gold to enrich himself. he was no true Greek
            if he did not. But what is meant by saying that he had received the money of
              <title>Polycrates</title>? This question has been much discussed. Possibly
            &lsquo;the money of Polycrates&rsquo; (with allusion, of course, to the riches
            of the Samian tyrant) was a sarcastic expression current in Athens for &lsquo;the
            money of Timocrates&rsquo;: this is perhaps the more likely as we are informed that
            the Athenians got no share of it themselves (<title>Hell.</title> III 5. 2). Plato would
            naturally avail himself of such a political gibe to express his dislike of a man who
            took gold from the natural enemy of Greece (<title>Rep.</title> V 470 C) to stir up not
            war, but sedition (ib. 470 B), and withdraw Agesilaus from fighting with the barbarian:
            for his political ideal in foreign policy was that of Cimon. See also on V 471 B. It is
            not however likely, I think, that the present passage was written after Ismenias' death,
            for Plato is not given to reviling his contemporaries after their death. That the other
            three persons cited by Plato were already dead would only make his reproof of the living
            more marked and scathing. The present passage&mdash;so far as it goes&mdash;is
            on the whole in favour of Teichm&uuml;ller's view (<title>Lit. Fehd.</title> I p.
            25) that the first book of the <title>Republic</title> was written soon after 395, when

            and become intransitive (e.g. VIII 563 A, <bibl n="Plat. Prot. 336A"><title>Prot.</title> 336 A</bibl>). Hartman's <foreign lang="greek">ᾖττεν</foreign> for <foreign lang="greek">ἧκεν</foreign> is not likely to find

            they rule: and in every state they pass laws in their own interest: and what is done in
            their own interest they call just.</p>
          <p>ff. The natural history definition of justice (<foreign lang="greek">ὁ φύσει ὅρος
              τοῦ δικαίου</foreign>
            <title>Laws</title> IV 714 C) is here for the first time mentioned in the
              <title>Republic.</title> It is to be noticed that the theory is presented by
            Thrasymachus not&mdash;in the first instance &mdash;as a rule of conduct for the
            individual, but as a political theory: his object is to describe the actual practice of
            Greek states (338 D ff.). We are thus for the first time introduced to the <hi rend="italic">political</hi> aspect of <foreign lang="greek">δικαιοσύνη</foreign>.
            The same view of the definition is taken in <title>Laws</title> 714 C ff., and it is the
            same theory which is afterwards (in II 358 E ff.) represented by Glauco as an hypothesis
            on which not Thrasymachus only but many others (<foreign lang="greek">Θρασυμάχου καὶ
              μυρίων ἄλλων</foreign> 358 C) explained the origin and constitution of existing
            states: cf. also <bibl n="Plat. Gorg. 483A"><title>Gorg.</title> 483 A</bibl> ff. We are
            therefore justified in supposing that the definition which Plato puts into the mouth of
            Thrasymachus represents a theory current in the politics of the day. The conduct of
            Athens towards her allies furnished many examples of the practical application of this
            rule of government; and, if we may trust Thucydides, similar principles were frankly
            laid down by Athenian statesmen in their speeches: see for example I 76. 2 <foreign lang="greek">ἀεὶ καθεστῶτος τὸν ἥσσω ὑπὸ τοῦ δυνατωτέρου
            κατείργεσθαι</foreign>, and cf. I 77. 4, V 89 and 105. 2 <foreign lang="greek">τὸ
              ἀνθρώπειον σαφῶς διὰ παντὸς ὑπὸ φύσεως ἀναγκαίας οὗ ἂν κρατῇ
            ἄρχειν</foreign>. It is indeed not too much to say that &lsquo;Might is
            Right&rsquo; was the only argument by which the existence of the Athenian empire
            could be defended before the tribunal of Greek public opinion, which regarded the
            independent <foreign lang="greek">πόλις</foreign> as the only legitimate form of civic
            life. Hence the dominion of Athens is often in Thucydides called a <foreign lang="greek">τυραννίς</foreign>, from which the Spartans claimed to be liberating their
            countrymen: see III 37. 2 <foreign lang="greek">τυραννίδα ἔχετε τὴν

              Lehre vom Staat</title> pp. 126&mdash;128. The most conspicuous assertion of the
            principle before Plato's time was found in Pindar's much-quoted fragment (Bergk 169 and

            view. It is in order to refute this theory, as expounded by Glauco and Adimantus,
            Thrasymachus' successors in the argument (see on <foreign lang="greek">παῖδες ἐκείνου
              τοῦ ἀνδρός</foreign> II 368 A) that Socrates finds it necessary to draw a picture
            of an Ideal State (ib. 368 D ff.), so that the <hi rend="italic">political</hi> theory
            of Plato's <title>Republic</title> may truly be said to commence here. For more on this

          <p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">σαρδάνιον</lemma>. Plato uses this expression as
            Homer does, of a sinister smile which bodes pain to others: <title>Od.</title> XX 301 f.
              <foreign lang="greek">μείδησε δὲ θυμῷ</foreign> &verbar; <foreign lang="greek">σαρδάνιον μάλα τοῖον</foreign> (of Odysseus among the suitors). Among later
            authors it more frequently denotes the forced smile which disguises the sufferer's own
            pain; and so apparently Simonides used the phrase (<bibl n="Plat. Fr. 202A"><title>Fr.</title> 202 A</bibl> Bergk). The explanations volunteered by the ancients
            apply only to the non-Homeric usage: the Scholiast, however, at the end of his note on
            this passage correctly remarks, <foreign lang="greek">μήποτε οὖν τὸ Ὁμηρικόν,

            etymology from the bitter Sardinian herb, <foreign lang="greek">ἧς οἱ γευσάμενοι
              δοκοῦσι μὲν γελῶντες, σπασμῷ δὲ ἀποθνῄσκουσιν</foreign> (Schol.). The
            Scholiast's suggested derivation from <foreign lang="greek">σαίρειν</foreign> (<hi rend="italic">ringi</hi>, as of an angry dog) suits the meaning which the phrase bears
            in Homer and Plato, and is probably right. Photius' <foreign lang="greek">σαρδάζων·

          <p>339B - 341A Now that the meaning of the definition has been explained, Socrates
            proceeds to attack it. Even if we assume that rulers seek their own advantage, yet they
            often err, and enact laws to their own disadvantage: therefore, as it is just for
            subjects to obey their rulers, Justice will sometimes consist in doing what is not the
            interest of the stronger. Socrates reiterates this objection and is supported by
            Polemarchus. It is urged by Clitophon that Thrasymachus meant by &lsquo;the interest
            of the stronger&rsquo; what was thought&mdash;whether rightly or
            wrongly&mdash; by the stronger to be to their interest. Thrasymachus declines to
            avail himself of this suggestion, and explains that, strictly speaking, rulers, qua
            rulers, cannot err. This statement he supports by arguing from the analogy of medical
            practitioners and others, pleading that his earlier concession was but a popular way of
            expressing the fact that rulers seem to err. Therefore the original definition was
            strictly correct. Justice is the interest of the stronger, since rulers make laws in
            their own interest, and, qua rulers, are infallible.</p>

          <p>341A - 342E Socrates now meets Thrasymachus on his own ground, and attacks his
            definition according to the &lsquo;strictest form&rsquo; of argument. He shews
            by analogy that every ruler qua ruler seeks the good of those whom he rules, since every
            art aims at the good of its own peculiar charge or object, and not at its own, for qua
            art there is nothing lacking to it.</p>
          <p>ff. It is to be noted that the discussion is now transferred from the region of facts
            into an atmosphere of idealism. For this, Thrasymachus is primarily responsible. The
            theory that the ruler <hi rend="italic">qua</hi> ruler makes no mistakes, is no doubt
            true ideally, but practically it is of little moment, since he will suffer <hi rend="italic">qua</hi> ruler for the errors which he commits in moments of aberration.
            The strength of Thrasymachus' theory lay in its correspondence with the facts (real or
            apparent) of experience; it is the temptation to defend his theory against the criticism
            of Socrates which leads him to abandon facts for ideas; and as soon as he is refuted on
            the idealistic plane, he descends to facts again (343 A ff.). The vein of idealism
            struck by Thrasymachus is worked to some purpose by Socrates. To assert that rulers <hi rend="italic">qua</hi> rulers always seek the good of their subjects is in reality to
            set before us a political ideal, and Plato's Ideal Commonwealth is intended to be its
            embodiment in a state. Plato was probably the first to develope and elaborate this
            principle of political science, but the legislations of Solon and other early lawgivers
            furnish examples of its application to practical politics (see especially Arist.
              <title>Rep. Ath.</title> ch. 12 and Solon's verses there cited), and it is formulated
            by the historical Socrates in Xen. <title>Mem.</title> III 2, with which compare

            retained this reading, in deference to the MSS, but it is open to grave objection. As
            the sentence stands, the meaning is that every art (as well as every object of an
            art&mdash;this is implied by <foreign lang="greek">καί</foreign>) has <hi rend="italic">one</hi>
            <foreign lang="greek">συμφέρον</foreign>, viz. to be as perfect as it can, but no
            other. In the sequel this is interpreted to mean that no art needs any additional
              <foreign lang="greek">ἀρετή</foreign>; since it is (<hi rend="italic">qua</hi> art)
            perfect already: <foreign lang="greek">οὔτε γὰρ πονηρία οὔτε ἁμαρτία οὐδεμία
              οὐδεμιᾷ τέχνῃ πάρεστιν κτλ.</foreign> (342 B). But the words of the sentence
              <foreign lang="greek">ἆρ’ οὖντελέαν εἶναι</foreign> have to be taken
            very loosely in order to admit of this interpretation. We must suppose them equivalent
            to &lsquo;No art has a <foreign lang="greek">συμφέρον</foreign> of its own, unless
            you are to call the fact that it is perfect its <foreign lang="greek">συμφέρον</foreign>.&rsquo; If Plato had written the passage as it stands in <hi rend="italic">q</hi> and in the margin of Flor. U (both MSS probably of the fifteenth
            century), it would be open to no objection: <foreign lang="greek">ἆρ’ οὖν καὶ

              εἶναι;</foreign> This reading was adopted by Bekker, and by Stallbaum in his first
            edition; and a careful study of the whole passage confirms the judgment of Schneider,
            &ldquo;Platonem non solum potuisse, sed etiam debuisse vel haec ipsa vel consimilia
            scribere.&rdquo; The same sense, expressed more briefly, may be obtained by the
            insertion of <foreign lang="greek">δεῖ</foreign> before <foreign lang="greek">εἶναι</foreign>: &lsquo;has every art also a <foreign lang="greek">ξυμφέρον</foreign> besides (i.e. besides the <foreign lang="greek">ξυμφέρον</foreign>
            of its object), or must it be as perfect as possible?&rsquo; <foreign lang="greek">&lt;&gt;κάστην</foreign> does not require to be repeated any more than in
            346 A below. The alteration is very slight; for <foreign lang="greek">δεῖ εἶναι,

          <p>343A - 344C Thrasymachus with much insolence of tone now abandons the idealistic point
            of view, and takes an example from experience. The shepherd does not, as a matter of
            fact, seek the good of his flock, but fattens them for his own or his master's
            advantage. In like manner it is their own advantage that is aimed at by rulers who
            deserve the name. Justice is &lsquo;other men's good&rsquo; (<foreign lang="greek">ἀλλότριον ἀγαθόν</foreign>), whereas Injustice is one's own: the just
            man comes off second best everywhere, alike in commercial and in political transactions.
            That it is far more to one's interest to be unjust than to be just, we may see from the
            case of tyrants, who represent Injustice in its most perfect form. All men envy them.
            Finally, Thrasymachus reiterates his original theory with the remark that Injustice on a
            sufficiently large scale is at once stronger, more worthy of a freeman, and more
            masterly and commanding than Justice.</p>
          <p>ff. It should be noted that Thrasymachus has in no way changed his theory, but only
            reverts to his original standpoint, that of experience. In the panegyric on Injustice in
            the present chapter, the new and important point is the appeal to the evidence of
            tyranny and the emotions which it roused in the mind of the Greeks. See on 344 B.</p>

          <p>344D - 347E The reply of Socrates falls into two parts. In the first (344 D&mdash;
            347 E), after emphatically expressing his dissent from Thrasymachus' views, and
            protesting against the Sophist's retractation (in the example of the shepherd and his
            sheep) of the doctrine that every ruler seeks the good of his subjects, Socrates reverts
            to the stricter form of reasoning to which Thrasymachus had formerly challenged him, and
            points out that no rulers, properly so called, rule willingly: they require wages. When
            any kind of rule, e.g. an art, is attended with advantage to the ruler, the advantage
            comes from the concomitant operation of the &lsquo;art of wage-earning,&rsquo;
            and not from the rule itself. Medicine produces health; the art of wages, wages; the
            doctor takes his fee, not qua doctor, but qua wage-earner. Thus it is not the ruler, qua
            ruler, but the subjects, as was already said, who reap the advantage. The wages which
            induce a man to rule, may be money, or honour, or the prospect of a penalty if he should
            refuse. The most efficacious penalty, in the case of the best natures, is the prospect
            of being ruled by worse men than themselves. In a city of good men, freedom from office
            would be as eagerly sought for as office itself is now. Herewith ends for the present
            the refutation of the theory that Justice is the interest of the stronger. Socrates
            promises to resume the subject on another occasion.</p>
          <p>ff. The ensuing discussion is not a new argument (see 345 C <foreign lang="greek">ἔτι
              γὰρ τὰ ἔμπροσθεν ἐπισκεψώμεθα</foreign>) in support of Socrates' view, but a
            restatement of his theory, with an addition necessitated by Thrasymachus' example of the
            shepherd. The shepherd (says Socrates) is no shepherd, when he fattens his sheep for his
            own gain, nor the ruler a ruler, when he enriches himself at the expense of his
            subjects. On such occasions both shepherd and ruler are in reality <foreign lang="greek">μισθωτικοί</foreign>&mdash;professors of <foreign lang="greek">μισθωτική</foreign>, an art which is distinct from that of ruling, though usually
            associated with it. This analysis is new and valuable in itself; it also enables
            Socrates (in 347 D) to make the first explicit allusion in the <title>Republic</title>
            to an ideal state, and to formulate what afterwards becomes a leading principle of the
            Platonic commonwealth&mdash;the reluctance of the ruling class to accept office.</p>

            It is surely much to the point to make Thrasymachus repudiate the imputation of
            trifling. His doctrine appears all the more dangerous when he confesses that it is no
              <pb n="42"/> sophistic paradox, but a rule of life. I can see nothing to justify

              ἀληθεστέρως δοκεῖ σοι λέγεσθαι;</foreign> is now generally adopted, but (apart
            from its considerable divergence from the MS reading) the juxtaposition of <foreign lang="greek">ποτέρως</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">ἀληθεστέρως</foreign> is
            unpleasing. The <foreign lang="greek">ποτέρως αἱρεῖ</foreign> of A is quite
            unobjectionable: cf. VII 528 A <foreign lang="greek">οὕτωσαἱροῦμαι</foreign>; and it is (I think) an objection to <foreign lang="greek">πότερον αἱρεῖ</foreign> that it would represent Socrates as asking
            Glauco not which <hi rend="italic">view</hi> he elected to take, but which <hi rend="italic">life</hi>&mdash;the just or the unjust&mdash;he chose for
            himself. Schneider (after Bekker) retains the reading of the best MSS in <foreign lang="greek">πότερον ὡς ἀληθεστέρως</foreign>, and explains the last two words as
            equivalent to <foreign lang="greek">ὥσπερ ὃ ἀληθεστέρως λέγεται</foreign>: but
              <foreign lang="greek">ὡς ἀληθεστέρως</foreign> could not (if written by Plato) be

            (Meier und Sch&ouml;mann <title>Attische Process</title> p. 924), so that Plato's

          <p>348B - 350C Thrasymachus now identifies Justice with Simplicity, Injustice with
            Discretion. Injustice he assigns to Virtue and Wisdom, Justice to their opposites. He
            further declares that Injustice is strong and beautiful, and is ready to predicate of it
            all that is usually predicated of Justice (348 B&mdash;349 B).</p>
          <p><hi rend="italic">Socrates then commences a very subtle refutation, addressing himself

              <hi rend="italic">The just man endeavours to overreach the unjust, but not the just:
              the unjust man to overreach both the just and the unjust. Therefore, generally, the

              and the unlike. Further, the unjust man, being wise and good, resembles the wise and
              good, while the just man, being foolish and evil, resembles the foolish and evil; in
              brief, each is as those whom he resembles.</hi> (2) <hi rend="italic">Again, from the
              analogy of the arts it is seen that the man who knows tries to overreach the unlike,
              while the ignorant man tries to overreach both the like and the unlike. But the man

          <p>ff. The second division of Socrates' reply begins here. Though professedly attacking
            the section of Thrasymachus' speech contained in 343 C&mdash; 344 C, and summed up
            in the theory that the life of the Unjust is better than that of the Just (347 E), it is
            not till 352 D that Socrates directly grapples with this theory. In the meantime,
            certain further deliver<pb n="49"/> ances of Thrasymachus on the nature of Injustice are
            refuted by means of arguments which have an indirect bearing on the question at issue
            (see 352 D <foreign lang="greek">φαίνονται μὲν οὖν καὶ νῦν, ὡς ἐμοὶ δοκεῖ, ἐξ
              ὧν εἰρήκαμεν· ὅμως δ’ ἔτι βέλτιον σκεπτέον</foreign>). This part of
            Socrates' reply may therefore be regarded as itself subdivided into two
            parts&mdash;the first being an indirect, the second a direct refutation of
            Thrasymachus. Cf. 352 D note</p>

            pervading fallacy in the discussion is akin to the <hi rend="italic">a dicto secundum

            &lsquo;unlike&rsquo; are used absolutely, and each of them is equated with
            itself. The wise man is held to be good, because one is good in that in which one is
            wise (this might however be justified on the &ldquo;stricter mode of
            reasoning&rdquo;). Finally, the just man is inferred to be wise and good, on the
            principle that one is what one resembles: but whether the resemblance be in essence or
            in accident, we are not told. The argument should be regarded as a dialectical <hi rend="italic">tour de force</hi>,&mdash;<foreign lang="greek">φιλόνικον μᾶλλον
              ἢ φιλάληθες</foreign>. The reasoning in the next section of the argument strikes a
            deeper note.</p>
          <p>350C - 352D Socrates now attacks the second assertion made by Thrasymachus in 349 A,
            viz. that Injustice is strong. Justice (he argues) is stronger than Injustice, both
            because it is (as we have seen) virtue and wisdom, and because in its effects it is the
            antithesis of Injustice, which infuses hatred and sedition, both into aggregates of
            individuals, and into the individual himself. Injustice weakens by preventing community
            of action; it makes men collectively and individually hateful to themselves and to the
            just, among whom are the gods. When Injustice seems to be strong, it is in virtue of
            some latent Justice which it still retains.</p>

            observed that the argument &ldquo;marks an era in philosophy. It is a first reading
            of the central facts of society, morality, and nature. In social analysis it founds the
            idea of organization and division of labour....In morality it gives the conception of a
            distinctively human life which is the content or positive end of the distinctively human
            will. And for natural knowledge it suggests the connection between function and
            definition, and consequently between purpose and reality, which is profoundly developed
            in the sixth and seventh books. These conceptions become corner-stones of Aristotle's
            Philosophy, and still, when seen in their connection, form the very core of the best

            it denotes that which is uniform, or single and simple, or true without any difference

          <p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ἐν ἑνὶ κτλ.</lemma> The results of Book IV are
            foreshadowed more clearly in what follows. The notion that justice present in the
            individual keeps the individual at peace with himself is more fully developed in 441 D,
            and implicitly assumes a psychological theory like that in Book IV, where soul is shewn
            to have &lsquo;parts&rsquo; (435 C ff.). Further, in Book IV, Plato first
            describes justice in the State, and afterwards justice in the individual, using the
            larger aggregate to assist him to find it in the smaller. The same method is observed
            here in the description of injustice, and afterwards in Books VIII and IX, where the
            varieties of <foreign lang="greek">ἀδικία</foreign> in states and individuals are
            described. The present passage (351 A &mdash;352 A), in fact, contains the
            undeveloped germ of the whole method and doctrine of the <title>Republic</title> (with
            the exception of Books V&mdash;VII). Cf. Hirmer <title>Entst. u. Kompos. d. Pl.

          <p>352D - 354C The argument here reverts to 347 E, and the rest of the book offers a
            direct refutation of the view that Injustice is more advantageous than Justice, in other
            words, that the life of the unjust man is better than that of the just. An indirect
            refutation, says Socrates, is afforded by the recent discussion (from 348 B to 352 D);
            the direct is as follows. Everything has its peculiar work or product (<foreign lang="greek">ἔργον</foreign>)&mdash;that, namely, which it alone produces, or
            which it produces better than aught else. Everything moreover has its own peculiar
            excellence, without which it will not do its work well. Now the work of soul is to
            deliberate, to rule, to live: its excellence is Justice. Therefore the just soul will
            live well, and to live well is to be blest and happy. And as this is more advantageous
            than to be miserable, Injustice can never be more advantageous than Justice. In
            conclusion, Socrates sums up regretfully: until we know what Justice is, we are not
            likely to discover whether it is a virtue or a vice, and whether its possessor is happy
            or unhappy.</p>
          <p>ff. The view that everything has its own peculiar function, which it can perform better
            than anything else, afterwards becomes one of the cardinal principles of the Ideal State
            (II 369 E ff.); and the statement that everything has an excellence or virtue of its own
            is reaffirmed <pb n="58"/> in Book X, where we are also told that everything has its own
            peculiar vice, that of soul being <foreign lang="greek">ἀδικία</foreign> (608 E ff.).</p>

            silence is the refutation of the statement that Injustice is strong (350 D&mdash;352
            C). The original question&mdash;the <hi rend="italic">quid sit</hi> of
            Justice&mdash;is abandoned at 347 E: the <hi rend="italic">quale sit</hi> occupies
            the rest of the dialogue, and Socrates enquires first whether Justice is vicious and
            ignorant, or wise and good (347 E&mdash; 350 C), next whether it is strong or weak
            (350 D&mdash;352 C), and lastly whether it is more or less advantageous than
            Injustice (352 D&mdash;354 A). To speculate on the <hi rend="italic">quale sit</hi>
            of a thing before determining its <hi rend="italic">quid sit</hi> is condemned by Plato

          <p>The question whether <foreign lang="greek">τῇ θεῷ</foreign> here and in 328 A is
            Bendis or Athena is not so simple as it appears.</p>
          <p>In favour of Athena it may be urged (1) that <foreign lang="greek">ἡ θεός</foreign>
            regularly means Athena in Attic literature (see for example <bibl n="Aristoph. Kn. 656">Ar.
                <title>Eq.</title> 656</bibl>, 903 al., and Plato <title>Laws</title> 806 B): (2)
            that in view of the relation between the <title>Republic</title> and the
            <title>Timaeus</title> it is difficult to separate <foreign lang="greek">τῇ
            θεῷ</foreign> here from <foreign lang="greek">τὴν θεόν</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">τῆς θεοῦ</foreign> in <bibl n="Plat. Tim. 21A"><title>Tim.</title> 21
            A</bibl> and 26 E, where the goddess is certainly Athena, (3) that it is dramatically
            appropriate for an Athenian to dedicate his ideal city to the patron goddess of Athens.
            Plato's perfect city would thus become in a certain sense a <foreign lang="greek">βασιλεία τῆς θεοῦ</foreign>.</p>
          <p>On the other hand, the goddess and the festival are mentioned so closely together that
            (if we have regard to the <title>Republic</title> by itself) we are scarcely justified
            in interpreting <foreign lang="greek">τῇ θεῷ</foreign> without reference to <foreign lang="greek">τὴν ἑορτήν</foreign>, and it is quite in harmony with Socrates'
            principles that he should be among the first to pay his vows at the shrine of the new
            goddess as soon as the <foreign lang="greek">νόμος πόλεως</foreign> received her. See
              <bibl n="Xen. Mem. 1.3.">Xen. <title>Mem.</title> I 3. </bibl>I, IV 3. 16. It is
            therefore safer to accept the usual view that Plato is thinking of Bendis. </p>

          <p>The reading <foreign lang="greek">φυλάξασθαι καὶ λαθεῖν, οὗτος δεινότατος καὶ
              ἐμποιῆσαι</foreign>, which has slight MS authority, is defended by Boeckh
              (<title>Kl. Schr.</title> IV pp. 326 ff.), with whom Zahlfleisch (<hi rend="italic">Zeitschr. f. &ouml;st. Gymn.</hi> Vol. XXVIII 1877, pp. 603 ff.) and others
            agree. Boeckh points out that <foreign lang="greek">καὶ λαθεῖν</foreign> (sc. <foreign lang="greek">νόσον</foreign>, according to his view) suggests (from its notion of
            clandestine cunning) the idea of stealing. This may be admitted, but the idea of
            stealing is much more forcibly suggested (as Stallbaum points out), if <foreign lang="greek">καὶ λαθεῖν</foreign> is construed with <foreign lang="greek">οὗτος
              δεινότατος κτλ.</foreign>, and this involves the necessity of changing (with
            Schneider) <foreign lang="greek">ἐμποιῆσαι</foreign> of the MSS to <foreign lang="greek">ἐμποιήσας</foreign>, for the construction <foreign lang="greek">λαθεῖν
              ἐμποιῆσαι</foreign>, though retained by Campbell, is destitute of authority. <pb n="63"/></p>
          <p>Even if Schneider's emendation be adopted, the argument is (as stated in the notes)
            fantastical and inconclusive. In order that the conclusion <foreign lang="greek">ὅτου
              τις ἄρα δεινὸς φύλαξ, τούτου καὶ φὼρ δεινός</foreign> should be valid,
              <foreign lang="greek">φυλάξασθαι</foreign> should be <foreign lang="greek">φυλάξαι</foreign>, and the objects of the two verbs in proposition (1) should be
            identical, as well as those in propositions (2) and (3). As it is, if we express
              <foreign lang="greek">φυλάξασθαι</foreign> in terms of <foreign lang="greek">φυλάξαι</foreign>, they are not identical: for in (1) it is the enemy whom you smite,
            but yourself whom you guard: in (2) it is yourself (or your patient) whom you guard, but
            the disease which you secretly implant: in (3) you guard your own army, but steal the
            enemy's plans, etc. Nevertheless Schneider's emendation is preferable to the traditional
            reading, which not only contains all the same fallacies as the other, but leaves the
            three stages of the argument in comparative isolation, attaches the first hint of
            &lsquo;stealing&rsquo; (<foreign lang="greek">λαθεῖν</foreign>) to the wrong
            member of the clause, and involves the use of the somewhat strained expression <foreign lang="greek">λαθεῖν νόσον</foreign>. It should be added that the change from
              <foreign lang="greek">ἐμποιῇσαι</foreign> to <foreign lang="greek">ἐμποιήσας</foreign> is not greater than the insertion of <foreign lang="greek">καί</foreign> before <foreign lang="greek">ἐμποιῆσαι</foreign>, and that <foreign lang="greek">ἐμποιήσας</foreign> was very likely to be corrupted under the influence
            of <foreign lang="greek">δεινὸς φυλάξασθαι</foreign> just before. The emphatic
            position of <foreign lang="greek">καὶ λαθεῖν</foreign> is necessary to call attention
            to the first suggestion of the idea contained in <foreign lang="greek">κλέψαι</foreign>; nor can I agree with J. and C. that in Schneider's emendation
            &ldquo;the emphasis falls on the wrong word.&rdquo; In <foreign lang="greek">λαθεῖν ἐμποιήσας</foreign>, which is virtually a single expression, <foreign lang="greek">λαθεῖν</foreign> is more important, in view of the conclusion <foreign lang="greek">καὶ κλέπτειν δεινός</foreign>, than <foreign lang="greek">ἐμποιήσας</foreign>.</p>
          <p>Hartman condemns the words <foreign lang="greek">καὶ λαθεῖν</foreign>, and thinks
              <foreign lang="greek">ὅστις</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">οὗτος</foreign>
            have changed places: &ldquo;cum enim ubique <foreign lang="greek">τὸ
            φυλάξασθαι</foreign> urgeatur (<foreign lang="greek">ὁ πατάξαι δεινότατος, οὗτος
              καὶ φυλάξασθαιὅσπερ κλέψαι..., ὁ αὐτὸς φύλαξ ἀγαθός</foreign>),
            requiritur <foreign lang="greek">οὗτος δεινὸς φυλάξασθαι, ὅστις δεινότατος
            κτλ.</foreign>; quibus tribus exemplis praemissis inversa ratione concludit <foreign lang="greek">ὅτου τις ἄρα δεινὸς φύλαξ, τούτου καὶ φὼρ
            δεινός</foreign>.&rdquo; Tucker revives the old conjecture <foreign lang="greek">καὶ ἀλθεῖν</foreign> (&lsquo;heal&rsquo;) instead of <foreign lang="greek">καὶ λαθεῖν</foreign>, and suggests (as an alternative) that <foreign lang="greek">λαθεῖν</foreign> should be <foreign lang="greek">μαθεῖν</foreign> (i.e. <foreign lang="greek">καὶ μαθεῖν οὗτος δεινότατος ἐμποιῆσαι</foreign> &lsquo;clever
            at learning how to implant&rsquo;). None of these conjectures appears to me so
            probable as that of Schneider. </p>

            adduced, and the idiom even if admissible is exceedingly harsh. Neither the suggestion
            of Stephanus (<foreign lang="greek">προσθεῖναι τῷ δικαίῳ ἄλλως ἢ</foreign>) nor
            that of Richards (to insert <foreign lang="greek">πλέον</foreign> after <foreign lang="greek">ἤ</foreign>) carries conviction. It should also be remarked that the
            words <foreign lang="greek">νῦν πρὸς τούτῳ ὧδε λέγειν</foreign> follow somewhat
            awkwardly as an explanation of <foreign lang="greek">προσθεῖναι τῷ δικαίῳ</foreign>
            if <foreign lang="greek">ἢ ὡς</foreign> is interpreted in Schneider's way.
            Stallbaum's <foreign lang="greek">ἢ ὡστὸν δὲ ἐχθρὸν κακῶς; νῦν πρὸς

            necessity of understanding <foreign lang="greek">λέγειν</foreign> after <foreign lang="greek">ἤ</foreign> (&lsquo;or to say, as we said at first&rsquo; etc.)

              <foreign lang="greek">νῦν πρὸς τούτῳ ὧδε λέγειν</foreign>. Faesius' proposal
            (in which he is followed by Ast, Madvig, and several editors) to eject <foreign lang="greek">ἤ</foreign> gives the required sense (&lsquo;do you bid us add to

            being explained by <foreign lang="greek">πρὸς τούτῳ ὧδε λέγειν</foreign>), but it
            fails to account for the presence of <foreign lang="greek">ἤ</foreign> in the MSS. It
            may seem an objection to the view which I take that <foreign lang="greek">ἤ</foreign>
            in a sentence of this kind would naturally introduce an alternative, whereas <foreign lang="greek">πρὸς τούτῳ ὧδε λέγειν</foreign> only explains <foreign lang="greek">προσθεῖναι</foreign>. This objection, such as it is, applies with still greater
            force to the view that <foreign lang="greek">ἤ</foreign> is
            &lsquo;than.&rsquo; Some will probably regard the whole clause from <foreign lang="greek">ἤλέγειν</foreign> as a marginal commentary on <foreign lang="greek">προσθεῖναι</foreign>; but this is much too drastic. Possibly <foreign lang="greek">ἤ</foreign> should be replaced by <foreign lang="greek">καί</foreign>&mdash;the corruption is said to be common (Bast <title>Comment.

          <p>Schneider's explanation of the words <foreign lang="greek">οἴου γε σύ</foreign> (sc.
              <foreign lang="greek">ἡμᾶς σπουδάζειν ὅ τι μάλιστα φανῆναι αὐτό</foreign>)
            would probably have met with wider acceptance if he had taken more pains to justify his
            view. The key to the meaning is to be found in the affirmative <foreign lang="greek">οἴεσθαί γε χρή</foreign> which sometimes follows <hi rend="italic">a
            fortiori</hi> reasoning of this kind in Plato. Two examples will suffice: <bibl n="Plat. Prot. 325B"><title>Prot.</title> 325 B</bibl>, C <foreign lang="greek">τὰ
              μὲν ἄλλα ἄρα τοὺς υἱεῖς διδάσκονται, ἐφ̓ οἷς οὐκ ἔστι θάνατος ἡ
              ζημία ἐὰν μὴ ἐπίστωνται, ἐφ̓ ᾧ δὲ ἥ τε ζημία θάνατος αὐτῶν τοῖς
              παισίταῦτα δ̓ ἄρα οὐ διδάσκονται οὐδ̓ ἐπιμελοῦνται πᾶσαν

            <foreign lang="greek">ἢ ἀνθρωπίνων μὲν παιδικῶνἀποθανόντων πολλοὶ

              αὐτόσε; οἴεσθαί γε χρή</foreign>. If in place of the imperative <foreign lang="greek">μὴ γὰρ δὴ οἴου</foreign>, Plato had used an interrogation (as he
            generally does in sentences of this kind), writing let us say <foreign lang="greek">ἢ
              οἴει</foreign> instead of <foreign lang="greek">μὴ γὰρ δὴ οἴου</foreign>, he
            would have added <foreign lang="greek">οἴεσθαί γε χρή</foreign>. The same way of
            writing, dictated of course by the desire to emphasize the <foreign lang="greek">δέ</foreign> clause, causes him to say <foreign lang="greek">οἴου γε</foreign> when
            the sentence is in the imperatival form. <foreign lang="greek">σύ</foreign> is of
            course necessary on account of <foreign lang="greek">ὦ φίλε</foreign>. For the
            affirmative sense of <foreign lang="greek">οἴου</foreign> cf. infra 346 E <foreign lang="greek">ἆῤ οὖν οὐδ̓ ὠφελεῖ τότε, ὅταν προῖκα ἐργάζηται; Οἶμαι
              ἔγωγε</foreign>, and X 608 D. Of the various suggestions made on this passage that
            of O. Apelt <foreign lang="greek">ἰού, ἰού, ὦ φίλε</foreign> &ldquo;aber
            wehe, o Freund, unsere Kraft, glaube ich, reicht nicht aus dazu&rdquo; (<title>Fl.
              Jahrb.</title> 1891, p. 557) deserves mention for its ingenuity; but except for the
            corruption of <foreign lang="greek">γε</foreign> to <foreign lang="greek">τε</foreign>
            (see cr. n.), the text is sound. There is certainly no occasion to follow <hi rend="italic">q</hi> and Stallbaum in writing <foreign lang="greek">μὴ οἴου

          <p>357A - 358E Socrates had thought the conversation at an end, but Glauco revives the
            theory of Thrasymachus. A threefold classification of goods is first agreed upon. Goods
            are desirable either (1) for their own sakes, or (2) both for their own sakes and for
            their consequences, or (3) for their consequences alone. Justice is placed by Socrates
            in the second and noblest of these three classes. Glauco on the other hand asserts that
            the Many place it in the third, and proposes to advocate the belief of the Many, not as
            holding it himself, but in order to compel Socrates to defend Justice and condemn
            Injustice solely on their merits. Thrasymachus, he thinks, has cried off too soon.</p>

            which are not necessarily devoid of all results, but only of pain. The same conception

              γέγονε δικαιοσύνη</foreign> (see cr. n.), especially as the confusion between
              <foreign lang="greek">οἷόν τε</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">οἴονται</foreign> occurs rather frequently in Platonic MSS (see Schneider on 1 329

            τε</foreign>, adopted by Stallbaum, as well as by Jowett and Campbell, on the authority
            of three MSS (Vind. F, Flor. RT), is unexceptionable in point of sense, but fails to
            account for the presence of <foreign lang="greek">τί</foreign> in the best MSS. I have
            ventured to read <foreign lang="greek">οἷόν τέ τι</foreign> (SC. <foreign lang="greek">ἐστί</foreign>), supposing that the confusion arose from the accidental
            omission of <foreign lang="greek">τι</foreign>, which was afterwards (as <foreign lang="greek">τί</foreign>) wrongly inserted before <foreign lang="greek">οἶόν</foreign> (where it remained in <foreign lang="greek">Π</foreign>), <foreign lang="greek">οἷον</foreign> itself being afterwards changed to <foreign lang="greek">ὄν</foreign> in order to provide a kind of construction (&lsquo;being what, and
            whence, it arises,&rsquo; J. and C.). This <foreign lang="greek">ὄν</foreign> was
            itself fortified by <foreign lang="greek">τυγχάνει</foreign> in Flor. B and the Aldine
            edition. Campbell's suggestion that &ldquo;<foreign lang="greek">τί ὄν

            ἐστί</foreign>&rdquo; is improbable: still less can Herwerden and Hartman induce
            us to reject the whole clause. Few will approve of Tucker's conjecture <foreign lang="greek">τί τῷ ὄντι καὶ ὅθεν κτλ.</foreign> Dr Jackson suggests <foreign lang="greek">ἄκουέ τι, οἷόν τε καὶ κτλ.</foreign>, and a reviewer of my

          <p>358E - 359B Glauco will first describe the origin and nature of Justice according to
            the theory which he has undertaken to maintain. According to nature, to commit injustice
            is a good, to suffer injustice an evil. But as there is more evil in suffering than good
            in committing injustice, experience causes men to enter into a compact neither to commit
            nor suffer wrong. The collective prescriptions of this compact are called Law and
            Justice. Justiceis accordingly a compromise between the best policy, i.e. doing wrong
            without incurring any penalty, and the worst, i.e. suffering wrong without being able to
            exact vengeance. No one will accept the compromise who is strong enough to do wrong
            successfully.</p>
          <p>ff. In thus resuscitating the theory of Thrasymachus, Glauco removes a serious
            stumbling-block by introducing the distinction between <foreign lang="greek">φύσις</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">νόμος</foreign>. Civilisation revolts
            against the anti-social doctrines of Thrasymachus in their application to itself, but
            receives them more favourably when its own existence is safeguarded by relegating them
            to an age anterior to society. The view maintained by Glauco is allied to that of
            Callicles in <bibl n="Plat. Gorg. 482E"><title>Gorg.</title> 482 E</bibl> ff.; and it
            has already been pointed out (on 1 337 A, 344 B) that similar views were tolerably

            endeavours to solve this difficulty by postulating a social contract. A kindred solution
            is ascribed by Aristotle to the Sophist Lycophron: <title>Pol.</title>

            possessed through his ring, and the just man will shew himself no better than the
            unjust. If, with this power to screen himself, the just man still refused to do wrong,
            no doubt men would praise him openly, but in secret they would judge him wholly

            suggested by the lines of Pindar cited in <bibl n="Plat. Gorg. 484B"><title>Gorg.</title> 484 B</bibl>
            <foreign lang="greek">νόμος ὁ πάντων βασιλεὺς θνατῶν τε καὶ ἀθανάτων

              <foreign lang="greek">παράγεται</foreign> adds the further notion that equality is
            not Nature's highway. For <foreign lang="greek">βίᾳ</foreign> i.q. <foreign lang="greek">βιαἴως</foreign> in conjunction with another dative Schneider cites
            VIII 552 E <foreign lang="greek">οὓς ἐπιμελείᾳ βίᾳ κατέχουσιν αἱ
            ἀρχαί</foreign>. In the next line it is better to regard <foreign lang="greek">τοιάδε</foreign> as explained by <foreign lang="greek">εἰγενέσθαι</foreign>, than as balancing <foreign lang="greek">οἴαν</foreign>, in which case <foreign lang="greek">εἰ αὐτοῖς γένοιτο</foreign>
            would be superfluous. The opportunity (<foreign lang="greek">ἐξουσία</foreign>) of
            working their will comes from the possession (<foreign lang="greek">εἰ αὐτοῖς
              γένοιτο</foreign>) of a certain active faculty (<foreign lang="greek">δύναμις</foreign>) like that of Gyges.</p>
          <p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">τῷ Γύγου κτλ.</lemma> Cf. X 612 B <foreign lang="greek">τὸν Γύγου δακτύλιον</foreign>. In Appendix I I have given reasons for
            believing that the Gyges of the proverbial &lsquo;Gyges' ring&rsquo; was not
            &ldquo;Gyges the Lydian&rdquo;&mdash;the hero of Herodotus' story (I 7), but
            a homonymous ancestor of his. If so, we must (on the hypothesis that the text is sound)
            suppose that Plato here omits the name of the original Gyges either because he wishes
            tacitly to contradict a prevalent misconception, or (more probably) because his readers
            might be presumed to know or to be capable of inferring that the ancestor of Gyges the
            Lydian was also called Gyges. The MS reading is supported by Proclus (<foreign lang="greek">τῷ κατὰ τὸν Γύγου πρόγονον διηγήματι</foreign> in Sch&ouml;ll
              <title>Procli Comm. in Remp. Pl. part. ined.</title> p. 60. 30). For other views of

            far better than that of the just. Let us suppose that each is the perfect embodiment of

            needful, and so apt at concealment that he enjoys the highest reputation for justice,
            while guilty of the worst acts of injustice; the other wishful not to be esteemed, but
            to be, good, and labouring until he dies under the imputation of the worst injustice,
            although he remains just. Only by means of this supposition can we make sure that the
            just man has not been attracted by the rewards of justice, but by justice itself. What
            will be the result? The just will be wholly miserable and unsuccessful, the unjust
            wholly prosperous and happy, doing good to their friends and evil to their foes; nay
            more, the unjust will be dearer to the gods than the just, because they have wherewith

          <p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">εἴη</lemma> is explained by Stallbaum as an
            optative of wish (though in a subordinate clause): &lsquo;it is not clear therefore
            whether he is fain to be just,&rsquo; etc. This gives a fair sense, but the idiom is
            obscure, and unsupported by other examples. J. and C. remark that &ldquo;the
            optative accords with the conditional nature of the case in an imagined
            future,&rdquo; taking <foreign lang="greek">ἄδηλον</foreign> as for <foreign lang="greek">ἄδηλον ἂν εἴη</foreign>. But an omitted <foreign lang="greek">ἂν
              εἴη</foreign> cannot be responsible for the mood of <foreign lang="greek">τοιοῦτος
              εἴη</foreign>, nor could <foreign lang="greek">ἂν εἴη</foreign> easily be
            omitted (see Schanz <title>Nov. Comm. Pl.</title> p. 33). Still less should we accept
            Hartman's <foreign lang="greek">ἄδηλον &lt;ἂν&gt; οὖν</foreign>, sc.
              <foreign lang="greek">εἴη</foreign>. Madvig ejects <foreign lang="greek">εἴη</foreign> altogether, understanding <foreign lang="greek">ἐστι</foreign> after
              <foreign lang="greek">τοιοῦτος</foreign>. This may be right, but its intrusion is not
            easy to explain. I think the word is genuine, and means &lsquo;was&rsquo;:
            &lsquo;it is not clear then, say they, whether he was just,&rsquo; etc. Glauco
            again disclaims responsibility: cf. 360 B note <foreign lang="greek">εἴη</foreign>
            would in direct speech be <foreign lang="greek">ἦν</foreign>: and the idiom is like
            that in III 406 E, where see note. For the sequence of moods and tenses cf. VI 490 A
            note Failing this interpretation, the word must (I think) be spurious. Herwerden's
              proposal&mdash;<foreign lang="greek">τοιούτῳ εἶναι, ἄδηλον ὄν</foreign>
            (retaining <foreign lang="greek">εἴη</foreign>)&mdash;does not surmount the
            difficulty and is also wrong in point of sense.</p>
          <p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ἀπ’ αὐτῆς</lemma>. See cr. n. The sense required

          <p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ἔστω</lemma>. See cr. n. I formerly read <foreign lang="greek">ἴτω</foreign> with A^{1} and the majority of editors, but I now agree
            with Schneider that <foreign lang="greek">ἔστω</foreign> is right. <foreign lang="greek">ἴτω</foreign> cannot be used by itself as a synonym for
            &lsquo;live,&rsquo; or as a copula: we should require <foreign lang="greek">ἴτω διὰ βίου</foreign>, instead of <foreign lang="greek">ἴτω μέχρι
            θανάτου</foreign> (to transpose the two phrases would of course be too violent a
            change). The sole authority for <foreign lang="greek">ἴτω</foreign> is the first hand
            in A: and this is certainly insufficient to outweigh the inherent superiority of
              <foreign lang="greek">ἔστω</foreign>. Most MSS have <foreign lang="greek">ἤτω</foreign>, a late form for <foreign lang="greek">ἔστω</foreign>.</p>

          <p>362C - 363E At this point Glauco gives way to Adimantus. Glauco had maintained the
            superiority of Injustice over Justice by directly praising Injustice: Adimantus will
            uphold the same thesis by describing the arguments usually advanced in favour of
            Justice. In the first place, when parents and friends exhort the young to follow
            Justice, they do not praise Justice herself, but the rewards which Justice earns from
            men and gods. Homer and Hesiod describe the benefits derived from Justice in this
            present life, while Musaeus and his son guarantee to her votaries sensual bliss
            hereafter, and others promise to the pious a long line of descendants, but relegate the
            wicked to punishment after death and unpopularity during life.</p>

            exhortations. Further, in order to make <foreign lang="greek">ἀπὸ τοῦ εὐδοκιμεῖν

            Injustice, men say, is in general the best policy: they admire the vicious rich, and
            despise the virtuous poor. Strangest of all, the gods themselves are said to be
            sometimes kind to the wicked, and unkind to the good; and seers profess to have power
            from the gods to atone for unjust dealing by pleasurable rites, and undertake to damage
            enemies for a trifling expenditure of money. In support of such teaching they quote the
            poets, Hesiod for example, and Homer. There are likewise books containing sacrificial

            are encouraged to practise Injustice, while outwardly pretending to be just. To escape
            detection by their fellow-men, they form political clubs, and employ persuasion and
            force. The gods they can afford to ignore; for either there are no gods, or they regard
            not man, or&mdash; according to those who are the sole authorities for their
            existence&mdash;they can be propitiated out of the proceeds of Injustice. There are
            special rites and gods who can deliver us from punishment after death: so the gods' own
            children say. So strong are the arguments in favour of Injustice that even those who can
            refute them make allowances, recognising that no one is voluntarily just except from
            innate goodness of disposition or scientific knowledge.</p>

              <foreign lang="greek">ταῦτα πάντα λεγόμενα κτλ.</foreign>; and it has
            not been said that it is useless to be just, unless one is also believed to be just
              (<foreign lang="greek">ἐὰν μὴ καὶ δοκῶ</foreign>). This would imply that it <hi rend="italic">is</hi> useful to be just, if one is also considered just; but what has
            been urged is that Justice is in itself never advantageous, although its <foreign lang="greek">εὐδοκιμήσεις</foreign> (363 A) are: see 358 C, E, 360 C (<foreign lang="greek">οὐδεὶς ἑκὼν δίκαιος, ἀλλ’ ἀναγκαζόμενος, ὡς οὐκ ἀγαθοῦ ἰδιᾳ

The proof is as follows. To <hi rend="italic">be</hi> just and <hi rend="italic">seem</hi> unjust is misery (see 361 E): to <hi rend="italic">be</hi> unjust, and <hi rend="italic">seem</hi> just is bliss (see 362

            preserved of at least two fables of his in which the fox appears (86&mdash;88 and 89

            one of the iambics in this or another Archilochean fable: it is at all events clear that
            they are from Archilochus. &lsquo;The crafty and subtle fox of
            Archilochus&rsquo; means simply &lsquo;the crafty and subtle fox of which

            playfully called his son. That this is the meaning appears from <bibl n="Plat. Phileb. 11A"><title>Phil.</title> 11 A</bibl>, B, 11 C <foreign lang="greek">δέχει δὴ τοῦτον τὸν νῦν διδόμενον, ὦ Πρώταρχε, λόγον; Ἀνάγκη δέχεσθαι·
              Φίληβος γὰρ ἡμῖν ὁ καλὸς ἀπείρηκεν</foreign>, 12 A, 16 B, 19 A: cf. also 15 C
            and 28 B. In precisely the same way Glauco and Adimantus are the &lsquo;children of
            Thrasymachus.&rsquo; They are <foreign lang="greek">διάδοχοι τοῦ λόγου</foreign>
            as appears from 357 A, 358 B (<foreign lang="greek">ἐπανανεώσομαι τὸν Θρασυμάχου
              λόγον</foreign>), 367 A and 367 C, as well as from the substance of their arguments.
            This image is in fact one of the links by means of which Plato binds the dialogue
            together: as Polemarchus is heir to Cephalus (331 E), so Glauco and Adimantus are heirs
            to Thrasymachus. In explaining <foreign lang="greek">ἐκείνου τοῦ ἀνδρός</foreign>
            of Thrasymachus, Stallbaum is therefore not &ldquo;ridiculous&rdquo; (as J. and
            C. assert) but right. See my article in <title>Cl. Rev.</title> X p. 237.</p>
          <p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ὁ Γλαύκωνος ἐραστής</lemma> may be Critias, as

          <p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">παῖδες -- ἀνδρός</lemma>. By <foreign lang="greek">Ἀρίστωνος</foreign>, the author of the line of course meant Aristo, father of

            halfironical, compliment to &lsquo;his excellency&rsquo; Thrasymachus, whose
              <foreign lang="greek">παῖδες</foreign> (so far as the argument is concerned) Glauco
            and his brother are: see on <foreign lang="greek">ὦ παῖδες</foreign> above. In <bibl n="Plat. Sym. 174B"><title>Symp.</title> 174 B</bibl>, when inviting Aristodemus to
            come as an uninvited guest to sup with Agathon, Socrates indulges in a similarly playful
            pun: <foreign lang="greek">ἕπου τοίνυν, ἔφη, ἵνα καὶ τὴν παροιμίαν

              <foreign lang="greek">αὐτόματοι δ’ ἀγαθοὶ δειλῶν ἐπὶ δαῖτας ἴασιν</foreign>,
            as the Scholiast remarks. Arnold Hug is ill-advised in adopting Lachmann's suggestion to

            sequel we find Justice only in the Ideal City: it is the degenerate Cities of VIII and
            IX that furnish the picture of Injustice. Plato does not expressly announce his change

            derived from an analysis of the industrial basis of society as it exists in civilised
            times: others (see 372 B&mdash;D), are semi-mythical and idyllic, recalling pictures

            Krohn: see <title>Pl. St.</title> pp. 59&mdash;62, where he collects the references
            to <foreign lang="greek">φύσις</foreign> throughout Books I&mdash;IV. The City of
            II&mdash;IV is a <foreign lang="greek">κατὰ φύσιν οἰκισθεῖσα πόλις</foreign>.
            What is meant by <foreign lang="greek">φύσις</foreign>? Not inorganic Nature, but the
            &lsquo;nature&rsquo; of a <foreign lang="greek">πόλις</foreign> or aggregate of
              <foreign lang="greek">πολῖται</foreign>, i.e. (as the unit in a city is the man)
            human nature, in other words, the nature of the human soul, which, according to Plato
            and Socrates, constitutes a man's true and proper individuality. It is not however human
            nature as it is, but as it ought to be, which is the foundation on which the Platonic
            State is built; so that, although the doctrine of transcendent Ideas is excluded from
            the first four books (see on III 402 C), Idealism at all events is present. See also
            Krohn <title>Plat. Frage</title> pp. 8&mdash;11, and (for the connotation of

          <p>It will be observed that the inhabitants of this &lsquo;First City&rsquo;
            subsist upon a vegetable diet. Cattle are used for ploughing and carrying, and supply
            wool and skins to make clothing and shoes (370 D, E), but animal food is unknown. It is
            improbable that Plato deliberately borrowed this trait from the current legends about
            the golden age (cf. <bibl n="Plat. Plt. 271D"><title>Pol.</title> 271 D</bibl> ff.): for
            he allows the slaughter of cattle for skins, whereas in the golden age animal life was
            held sacred (see Empedocles ap. Arist. <title>Rhet.</title> I 13. 1373^{b} 14 ff. and
            Robertson Smith <title>Religion of the Semites</title> pp. 282 ff.). But he no doubt
            regarded vegetarianism as characteristic of the primitive innocence of a pastoral
            community (<title>Laws</title> 782 A&mdash;D). In Plato's days, as now, the Greek
            peasant was almost a vegetarian. To argue from this and kindred passages (esp. <bibl n="Plat. Tim. 77A"><title>Tim.</title> 77 A</bibl>&mdash;C and 80 E) as
            Teichm&uuml;ller does (<title>Lit. Fehd.</title> II pp. 187&mdash;202), that
            Plato was himself a vegetarian, is somewhat hazardous. Whether Plato wished his farmers
            to be vegetarians or not, he permits the soldiers to eat flesh: cf. III 404 B ff. <pb n="99"/></p>

          <p>372D - 373C Glauco protests against the swinish character of such a life: more comfort,
            he thinks, should be allowed. While expressing his opinion that the healthy State is
            that which he has already described, Socrates is willing to describe the
            &lsquo;inflamed&rsquo; (<foreign lang="greek">φλεγμαίνουσα</foreign>) City, in
            case Justice and Injustice should be discovered in it (372 D&mdash;372 E).</p>

            <hi rend="italic">Some will not be satisfied with the provisions of our first city, but
              will demand a variety of physical comforts and delicacies, and artistic delights. A
              crowd of hunters and imitative artists of different kinds will accordingly spring up,
              and the race of middlemen will be largely increased. As a flesh diet will come into
              fashion, swineherds will be in demand, and cattle will multiply. The new style of
              living will bring doctors to the front.</hi>
          </p>
          <p>ff. The provisions of the <foreign lang="greek">πρώτη πόλις</foreign> are
            insufficient for the satisfaction of human needs: for there is <foreign lang="greek">θυμός</foreign> as well as <foreign lang="greek">ἐπιθυμία</foreign> in the soul of
            man. Hence we must advance a stage further. Plato's method is as follows. He begins by
            enumerating many of the features of ordinary Greek life, as he found it, without
            distinguishing the good from the bad. The resulting picture he calls a <foreign lang="greek">τρυφῶσα</foreign> or <foreign lang="greek">φλεγμαίνουσα
            πόλις</foreign>. The next step is to purge this <foreign lang="greek">τρυφῶσα
            πόλις</foreign> (cf. III 399 E <foreign lang="greek">λελήθαμέν γε διακαθαίροντες
              πάλιν ἣν ἄρτι τρυφᾶν ἔφαμεν πόλιν</foreign>) by excluding some of the
            features, and correcting and regulating others, both by prescriptive enactments and
            still more by the influence of education. It is this <foreign lang="greek">κεκαθαρμένη
              πόλις</foreign> which forms what we may call Plato's <foreign lang="greek">δευτέρα
              πόλις</foreign> (II 372 E&mdash;IV): his third and crowning effort, the City of
            the Rulers, is contained in Books V&mdash;VII. Cf. VIII 543 E note and Hirzel <hi rend="italic">der Dialog</hi> I pp. 235 ff.</p>
          <p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ὑῶν</lemma>. The city of Pigs is supposed by
            Zeller^{4} II 1 pp. 325, 893, and D&uuml;mmler <title>Antisthenica</title> pp. 5
            ff., <title>Proleg. zur Pl. Staat</title> p. 61, to be a contemptuous allusion to
            Antisthenes' ideal commonwealth (on which see Susemihl in <title>Fl. Jahrb.</title> 1887
            pp. 207&mdash;214). This conjecture requires us to interpret Plato's first sketch of
            a State as wholly ironical and intended &lsquo;to warn us against the false ideal of
            a Nature-City&rsquo; (Zeller l. c.). I agree with Henkel (<title>Stud. zur Gesch. d.
              Gr. Lehre vom Staat</title> pp. 8 f.) in thinking that there is no solid ground for
            Zeller's theory. The <foreign lang="greek">πρώτη πόλις</foreign> is not of course
            Plato's ideal republic, and his description of it is plentifully bestrewn with irony,
            but it is nevertheless the foundation on which his city is built, and, in point of fact,
            although some of its features are implicitly corrected or superseded in the sequel, it
            still remains on the whole, and as far as it goes, a not unpleasing picture of the life
            of the lowest stratum in Plato's city, and it is nowhere expressly cancelled or
            abolished. See also on 369 B and 372 E. The <foreign lang="greek">εὐχερὴς
            βίος</foreign> (<bibl n="Plat. Plt. 266C"><title>Pol.</title> 266 C</bibl>) of the
              <foreign lang="greek">πρώτη πόλις</foreign> is fitly compared to that of pigs, the
              <foreign lang="greek">εὐχερέστατον γένος τῶν ὄντων</foreign> (ib.); and it is
            appropriate that Glauco, who is nothing if not <foreign lang="greek">θυμοειδής</foreign> (<title>Introd.</title> &sect; 2), should thus express his
            contempt for a life which hardly if at all rises above the level of <foreign lang="greek">ἐπιθυμία</foreign>.</p>

            in the same way, for he assigns the words <foreign lang="greek">οὐδὲν

          <p>373D - 376C In consequence of the increase of population we shall require more land. We
            must accordingly appropriate some of our neighbours' territory, just as under similar
            conditions they will lay hands upon ours. Herein we have the genesis of War. The duties
            of War&mdash; according to our principle of the subdivision of labour&mdash;will
            involve us in a standing army of professional soldiers or
            &lsquo;Guardians.&rsquo; Now as War demands not only concentration and
            application, but also a certain natural aptitude, our Guardians must be qualified by
            Nature for their duties: that is to say, like generous dogs, they must be quick to
            perceive, swift to pursue, and strong in actual fight. They should also be brave and
            spirited, but gentle to their fellow-citizens and one another. The union of gentieness
            with spirit in the same nature is rare, but not unknown among men, any more than it is
            among dogs. Our Guardians must in fact be &lsquo;philosophic&rsquo; (<foreign lang="greek">φιλόσοφοι</foreign>), like the dog, who is a true philosopher when he
            defines friend and foe respectively by knowledge and by ignorance, hating the unknown,
            and welcoming the known. In brief, we shall require a guardian to be naturally
            philosophic, spirited, swift, and strong.</p>

            held&mdash;is the root of all evil. This explanation is due to Schleiermacher;
            others (Schneider, Stallbaum, J. and C. as an alternative) refer <foreign lang="greek">ἐξ ὧν</foreign> to war and the like=&lsquo;ex cuiusmodi rebus&rsquo;
            (Stallbaum). It is an objection to such a view that it makes Plato say that evils come

              (<foreign lang="greek">μηδέν γέ πω  ἐργάζεται</foreign>). Further, if

            a platitude and almost deserve to be expunged from the text, as it is by Herwerden. On
            the other hand <foreign lang="greek">ἐξ ὧνγίγνηται</foreign> is on
            Schleiermacher's view quite consistent with <foreign lang="greek">μηδέν γέ

            which harms a State, in itself it may (and does) actually do good. Good in other words

            ed. Brandis (Berlin 1836) 23^{b} 16 ff. <foreign lang="greek">τετάρτη δὲ</foreign>

            The Cynics were themselves very fond of pointing the moral from the lower animals to man
            (D&uuml;mmler <title>Proleg.</title> p. 58 note 2), and Plato here paints them not
            unkindly in colours of their own. It should be noted that throughout II&mdash;IV
            Plato uses <foreign lang="greek">φιλόσοφος</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">φιλοσοφία</foreign> with less of an intellectual than of a moral connotation. In the
            earlier books the word is for the most part connected with a gentle considerate
            disposition or character, whether naturally implanted or the result of culture (cf III
            410 E, 411 C, 411 E): in 407 C the sense is somewhat different. See Nettleship in
              <title>Hellenica</title> pp. 77&mdash;79, and Krohn <title>Pl. St.</title> p. 71.
            It is not until the latter part of Book V (473 B ff.) where Plato is proposing to enter
            on the third and final stage of his ideal city, viz. the <foreign lang="greek">κατάστασις τῶν ἀρχόντων</foreign>, that the intellectual aspect of the word
            begins to predominate over the moral. Cf. IV 439 D note <pb n="109"/></p>

              like the stories about Cronus and Uranus, Zeus and Cronus, are not only false in

            educational scheme contained in Books II and III contributes to the purgation of the
              <foreign lang="greek">τρυφῶσα πόλις</foreign>, and thereby helps to complete Plato's
            second picture of an ideal city: see on 372 D ff. For the correct understanding of these
            regulations it is well to bear in mind (1) that Plato's object in this preliminary
            discipline is to train the character rather than the intellect (cf. IV 430 C note), and
            (2) that all the guardians have to pass through this curriculum. The higher scheme of
            education (in Book VII), on the other hand, is confined to those guardians who are to be
            made Rulers in the State, and its express aim is to educate the intellect rather than
            the will. See especially VI 502 E, VII 521 D&mdash;522 A notes The best discussion
            on Plato's theory of education in its broader aspects is still, I think, Nettleship's

            different: see 382 B note &lsquo;Lies&rsquo; are necessary&mdash;so Plato

            passed over by Plato, because he could not state his view without anticipating the

            <title>Homer</title> p. 89. In Plato's day the Cynics were the chief exponents of this

            from Xen. <title>Symp.</title> 3. 6, and <title>Mem.</title> I 3. 7: so also does Plato,

            different recension from the Alexandrian. The use of <foreign lang="greek">κῆρες</foreign> unpersonihed was apparently not admitted by the Alexandrian critics.

          <p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">θεῶν ἔριν τε καὶ κρίσιν</lemma>. This is usually
            explained as referring to the Theomachy (<title>Il.</title> XX 1&mdash;74), which
            was caused by Zeus and Themis in the sense that Zeus sent Themis to summon the gods to
            the council at which it was <pb n="117"/> sanctioned (<hi rend="italic">v.</hi> 4). But
            (1) Themis' part in causing the Theomachy is very small, (2) the simplest and most
            natural meaning of <foreign lang="greek">κρίσις</foreign> is not
            &lsquo;contention,&rsquo; but &lsquo;judgment&rsquo; or
            &lsquo;decision,&rsquo; and (3) the Theomachy in Homer is not productive of evil
            to men, but only to the gods themselves: its citation here would therefore be quite
            irrelevant. W. R. Hardie (in <title>Cl. Rev.</title> IV p. 182) is, I believe, right in
            supposing that the strife of the goddesses three and Paris' judgment is meant. <foreign lang="greek">ἔρις</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">κρίσις</foreign> are
            regularly thus used: e.g. <bibl n="Eur. IA 1307">Eur. <title>I. A.</title> 1307</bibl>
            <foreign lang="greek">κρίσινστυγνὰν ἔριν τε καλλονᾶς</foreign>; cf. ib.

              <foreign lang="greek">Κρίσις</foreign> was the name of Sophocles' play on the
            judgment of Paris (<title>Fr.</title> 330). The poem referred to by Plato is the Cypria
            (so also Wilamowitz <title>Hom. Unters.</title> p. 367 note 46), which traced the war of
            Troy to the judgment of Paris, and that to Zeus' deliberations with Themis (<foreign lang="greek">Ζεὺς βουλεύεται μετὰ τῆς Θέμιδος περὶ τοῦ Τρωικοῦ
            πολέμου</foreign> Kinkel <title>Epic. Graec. Fr.</title> p. 17. <foreign lang="greek">Θέμιδος</foreign> is Heyne's emendation for <foreign lang="greek">Θέτιδος</foreign>: but it is scarcely open to doubt: for the marriage of Peleus and
            Thetis, at which the three goddesses quarrelled, was an episode of the poem, and Thetis
            could hardly therefore have been privy to the plot. See Kinkel l. c. pp. 20, 22 and
            Jebb's <title>Homer</title> p. 153). Themis was Zeus' <foreign lang="greek">ἀρχαία
              ἄλοχος</foreign> (Pind. <bibl n="Plat. Fr. 30B"><title>Fr.</title> 30 B</bibl>ergk),
            and still appears as one of the Olympians in <title>Il.</title> XV 87. The Cypria is
            quoted again by Plato in <bibl n="Plat. Euthyph. 12A"><title>Euthyph.</title> 12
            A</bibl>. We may fairly suppose that <foreign lang="greek">θεῶν ἔρις τε καὶ
            κρίσις</foreign> was the heading of one of the introductory episodes in the poem: to
            this also the omission of the article with <foreign lang="greek">ἔριν τε καὶ
            κρίσιν</foreign> seems to point. Mr Hardie thinks Plato may have attributed the poem to
            Homer; but <title>Euthyph.</title> l. c. (<foreign lang="greek">ὁ ποιητὴς ὁ

            its antecedent in sentences of this kind. If <foreign lang="greek">οἷς</foreign> is

            &lsquo;if any one puts into poetry topics in which these iambics occur&rsquo;

            <title>Choeph.</title> 309&mdash;314, 400 &mdash;404, 886, 927: in Sophocles and

              <foreign lang="greek">σωφρονίζειν, δικαιοῦν, εὐθύνειν</foreign>, for
            &lsquo;punish.&rsquo; In Plato punishment is remedial. Ignorance or vice is in
            the soul what disease is in the body (IV 444 C, cf. IX 591 A, B), and the judge is the
            soul's physician (III 409 E ff., <bibl n="Plat. Gorg. 478D"><title>Gorg.</title> 478
            D</bibl>): hence (<bibl n="Plat. Gorg. 480B"><title>Gorg.</title> 480 B</bibl> ff.) the
            sinner should go before the judge as a patient visits his doctor, and we should even
            prosecute our guilty friends and relations. See also <title>Laws</title> 854 D, 862 E,

            are themselves incurable, help to cure others by their deterrent example (X 616 A): so
            that in its deepest relations this doctrine reaches to the very roots of Plato's
            philosophy, with all due deference to Mr W. S. Lilly, who with much intemperance of

          <p>380D - 383C In the second place, God is changeless, and incapable of deceiving. He is
            changeless, since He is the best. That which is the best cannot be changed by others,
            and will not change itself, for it can only change to what is worse. Homer and the other
            poets err in attributing changefulness to the gods. Neither can God deceive, for while
            the true or veritable lie, that is to say, ignorance of truth within the soul, is
            hateful alike to gods and men, the spoken lie, which is but an image of the other, is
            admissible only when used against enemies, or on behalf of friends, or to invest the
            ancient and unknown with a semblance of reality. God has no need of lying for any of

            character which he desired to foster, Plato is acting strictly in accordance with the
            method of Greek theology, whose Olympus is an image of human society. The end of human

            not close enough to suggest that Plato was thinking of Parmenides when he wrote this
            chapter. Although the unchangeableness of God was taught by Xenophanes and the Eleatics,
            there are few if any traces of such a doctrine outside the philosophers before

            IX 589 C: it is further implied by the entire scheme of education in Books VI and VII.

            vice is in harmony with popular Greek psychology, in which the intellect was not clearly
            distinguished from the will; it can be traced in the moral connotation of words like
              <foreign lang="greek">ἀμαθής, ἀπαίδευτος, ἀγνώμων</foreign>. In close connexion
            with this conception of vice is Plato's view of punishment as remedial: see 380 B

            <foreign lang="greek">. τοῦ ἐν τῇ ψυχῇ παθήματος</foreign> must not be explained
            (with Bosanquet <title>Companion</title> p. 93) as the state of mind of him who <hi rend="italic">tells</hi> a lie: for that is knowledge, and the spoken lie certainly is
            not an imitation of knowledge. They refer to the &lsquo;true lie,&rsquo; which
            is a certain <foreign lang="greek">πάθημα</foreign> in the soul of the &lsquo;true
            liar,&rsquo; viz. ignorance, and of which the spoken lie is an imitation. It is a
            tolerably accurate definition of a lie to call it &lsquo;an imitation of ignorance
            in the soul&rsquo;: cf. IV 443 C note The spoken lie is &lsquo;not a wholly
            unmixed lie,&rsquo; because it implies that the speaker <hi rend="italic">knows</hi>
            the truth: in a certain sense therefore it is mixed with truth. It is <foreign lang="greek">ὕστερον γεγονός</foreign>, because the spoken lie cannot be uttered
            until the truth is known. Inasmuch as the spoken lie is mixed with truth, it is better
            than the &lsquo;veritable lie.&rsquo; We have here nothing but a special
            application of the old Socratic paradox <foreign lang="greek">ὁ ἑκὼν ἁμαρτάνων
              ἀμείνων</foreign> (see on I 334 A). I have placed a comma after <foreign lang="greek">γεγονός</foreign>, to mark the antithesis between <foreign lang="greek">εἴδωλον</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">ἄκρατον ψεῦδος</foreign>, and
            because <foreign lang="greek">εἴδωλον</foreign> is not so much to be taken with
              <foreign lang="greek">τοῦ ἐν τῇ ψυχῇ παθήματος</foreign>: rather it stands for
              <foreign lang="greek">εἴδωλον ψεύδους</foreign>, as <foreign lang="greek">οὐ πάνυ
              ἄκρατον ψεῦδος</foreign> shews. The distinction between veritable and spoken lies
            savours, no doubt, of idealism: but it enables Plato to call his ideal archons ideally
            truthful, even when practically they tell lies, and it is with this object in view that
            the distinction is introduced. See III 389 B.</p>

            in which Thetis was one of the characters (Schol. on <bibl n="Aristoph. Ach. 883">Ar.

              φόρμιγγα</foreign>) appears as present at the marriage of Thetis also in Homer
              (<title>Il.</title> XXIV 62, 63). Plato accommodates the beginning of the quotation to
            his own sentence: in Aeschylus perhaps it ran <foreign lang="greek">ὁ δ’ ἐνεδατεῖτο
              τὰς ἐμὰς εὐπαιδίας</foreign> (so Butler, quoted by Schneider). <foreign lang="greek">ἐνδατεῖσθαι</foreign>, &lsquo;to dwell upon or
            emphasize,&rsquo; is elsewhere always used in an ominous sense (see Jebb on <bibl n="Soph. OT 205">Soph. <title>O. T.</title> 205</bibl>): and here too, perhaps, it
            strikes a foreboding note. The words <foreign lang="greek">μακραίωνας βίους</foreign>
            were doubted by Stephanus, who suggested <foreign lang="greek">μακραίωνος
            βίου</foreign> (so Euseb. <title>Praep. Ev.</title> XIII 3. 35) or <foreign lang="greek">μακραίωνας βίου</foreign>: but Apollo's prophecies did not refer to
            Achilles only, so that the plural is justified. <foreign lang="greek">ἀπείρους</foreign> should be taken not with <foreign lang="greek">εὐπαιδίας</foreign>, but with <foreign lang="greek">βίους</foreign>, which is in
            apposition to <foreign lang="greek">εὐπαιδίας</foreign>. In the next line <foreign lang="greek">θεοφιλεῖς ἐμὰς τύχας</foreign> depends on the compound expression
              <foreign lang="greek">παιῶν’ ἐπηυφήμησεν</foreign>&mdash;a construction
            frequent in Aeschylus, especially with verbs which denote singing, celebrating, etc.
              (<title>Ag.</title> 174, 175 al.): after enumerating all the blessings in store for
            Thetis (<foreign lang="greek">ξύμπαντά τ’ εἰπών</foreign>) Apollo raised a paean

            προγόνῳ</foreign>) which have been suggested in order to bring the present passage
            into harmony with the allusion in Book X 612 B, assume that the Gyges of
            &lsquo;Gyges' ring&rsquo; is identical with the famous Gyges (who reigned about
            687&mdash;654 B.C.), founder of the third or Mermnad dynasty of Lydian kings (Hdt. I
            8&mdash;13). On this assumption <foreign lang="greek">τοῦ Λυδοῦ</foreign> cannot
            mean &lsquo;Lydus&rsquo; (the eponymous ruler of Lydia: see Hdt. I 7), but must
            mean &lsquo;the Lydian&rsquo; i.e. (according to the usual interpretation)
            Croesus, who was the <foreign lang="greek">πέμπτος ἀπόγονος Γύγεω</foreign> (Hdt. I
            13). There is however no proof to shew that <foreign lang="greek">ὁ Γυδός</foreign>
            could without further specification denote Croesus; and on this ground alone Wiegand's

              [<foreign lang="greek">Γύγου</foreign>] <foreign lang="greek">τοῦ Λυδοῦ
            προγόνῳ</foreign> breaks down: while Jowett and Campbell's alternative suggestions

            satisfactory in point of sense, fail to account for the disappearance of <foreign lang="greek">Κροίσου</foreign>.

          <p>There is however no solid reason for connecting the Gyges of the proverb with the
            historical Gyges. In narrating the adventures of the latter, Herodotus makes no mention
            of a magic ring; but if such a legend had been told of the founder of the Mermnadae,
            Herodotus is hardly likely to have ignored it. In Plato's narrative, on the other hand,
            everything hangs on the ring. Nor is the magic ring known to Nicolaus Damascenus, whose
            account of Gyges seems to follow a different tradition from that of Herodotus: see
            M&uuml;ller's <title>Frag. Hist. Graec.</title> III pp. 382&mdash;386. It is
            therefore possible that Plato's story refers not to Herodotus' Gyges, but to some
            homonymous ancestor of his, perhaps (as Stein suggests on Hdt. I 13) the mythical
            founder of the family, whose name may have survived in the <foreign lang="greek">λίμνη
              Γυγαίη</foreign> (Hdt. I 93). The Gyges of history was not the first member of his
            family to bear that name: his great-grandfather at least was also called Gyges (Nic.
            Dam. l.c.). The resemblance between the two stories&mdash;that of Herodotus and that
            of Plato&mdash;is confined to two incidents, viz. the joint murder of the reigning
            sovereign by the queen <pb n="127"/> and her paramour, and their succession to the
            throne. In these two features the history of the later Gyges may well have been
            embellished from the legends about his mythical namesake, or he may actually have copied
            his ancestor's example. It is noticeable that Cicero says nothing to shew that he
            identified the Gyges of Plato's story with the Gyges of history; and in a poem by
            Niz&aacute;m&iacute; (as Mr J. G. Frazer has pointed out to me), where Plato
            tells the story of the ring, the name of Gyges is not even mentioned. (See Prof.
            Cowell's article in the <title>Journal of the Asiatic Society of Bengal</title>, Vol. 30
            pp. 151&mdash;157. Prof. Cowell thinks Niz&aacute;m&iacute; became
            acquainted with the legend through Arabic translations of the <title>Republic.</title>)
            Thinking it probable, therefore, that the proverbial ring of Gyges belonged not to
            Herodotus' Gyges, but to one of his ancestors bearing the same name, I have retained the
            MS reading. I do not think that the suppression of the name is a difficulty, though it
            would be easy to write (as I formerly did) <foreign lang="greek">&lt;τῷ
              Γύγῃ&gt;, τῷ Γύγου τοῦ Λυδοῦ προγόνῳ</foreign>. See
            <title>Introd.</title> &sect; 5. Such a solution would bring the text into strict
            verbal harmony with X 612 B, with Cicero <title>De off.</title> III 38 (where the story
            is related, not of an ancestor of Gyges, but of Gyges himself&mdash;<hi rend="italic">hinc ille Gyges inducitur a Platone</hi>), with Lucian
            <title>Nav.</title> 41 and <title>Bis Acc.</title> 21, and with Philostratus <title>Vit.
              Apoll.</title> 101. In each of these places we hear of &lsquo;Gyges'
            ring,&rsquo; not of &lsquo;Gyges' ancestor's ring.&rsquo; But it is better
            to adhere to the almost unanimous testimony of the MSS, especially as in this particular
            passage they are reinforced by Proclus. Schneider can hardly be right in supposing that
            the older Gyges is an invention of Plato's, although in other respects his note is
            deserving of attention: &ldquo;Platoni vero licebat alterum Gygen fingere, ingenio
            et fortuna similem interfectori Candaulae, quem ideo genus ab illo ducentem facit,
            prioris nomen, quippe quod commune ei cum posteriori esset, reticens.&rdquo; </p>

          <p>Dr Jackson proposes to read <foreign lang="greek">τούτου</foreign> for <foreign lang="greek">τοῦτον</foreign>, and omit <foreign lang="greek">ἔχειν</foreign> and

            <title>App.</title> I). Philostratus is also silent on the subject
            (<title>Heroic.</title> 28). If the principle of this solution is correct, I should
            prefer to retain <foreign lang="greek">τοῦτον</foreign>: for there seems to be no

              probability&mdash;<foreign lang="greek">τοῦτον</foreign> might be
            &lsquo;regarded as a second accusative after <foreign lang="greek">ποιήσαντα</foreign> understood with <foreign lang="greek">ἄλλο μὲν

          <p>Dr Jackson's view of the passage, in which I formerly concurred, gives excellent sense,
            and may be right. But it is to be noticed (1) that our chief authority for <foreign lang="greek">ἔχειν</foreign> is Ven. <foreign lang="greek">Π</foreign>, a MS which
            is quite independent of Paris A and constantly enables us to restore lacunae in that MS,
            and (2) that there are other examples in Paris A of the omission of a single word
            without the excuse of homoioteleuton. See <title>Introd.</title> &sect; 5. <foreign lang="greek">Ξ</foreign> and Flor. B omit <foreign lang="greek">ἔχειν</foreign>,

          <p>Instead of <foreign lang="greek">βλάψειν</foreign>, the best MSS read <foreign lang="greek">βλάψει</foreign>. If <foreign lang="greek">βλάψει</foreign> is

            gives the right sense, but the change from the singular to the plural (in <foreign lang="greek">πείθοντες</foreign>) is very harsh. If we adopt the first alternative
            (to which J. and C. incline), we must regard the clause <foreign lang="greek">ἐάν τέ
              τινα βλάψει</foreign> as semi-parenthetical, and connect <foreign lang="greek">πείθοντες</foreign> with <foreign lang="greek">ἀγύρται δὲ καὶ
              μάντεις</foreign> at the beginning of the sentence. Such a solution is not less harsh
            than (2). <foreign lang="greek">βλάψει</foreign> must, I think, be pronounced corrupt.
            Muretus read <foreign lang="greek">βλάψαι</foreign>, depending, like <foreign lang="greek">ἀκεῖσθαι</foreign>, on <foreign lang="greek">δύναμις</foreign>; but
              <foreign lang="greek">βλάψαι</foreign> is not likely to have been corrupted into
              <foreign lang="greek">βλάψει</foreign>, nor is it clear why the aorist should take
            the place of the present (as in <foreign lang="greek">ἀκεῖσθαι</foreign>). Reading
              <foreign lang="greek">βλάψειν</foreign>, we might perhaps regard the construction as
            one of the rare cases in which <foreign lang="greek">δύναμις</foreign> and the like are
            followed by a future infinitive: see Jebb's Soph. <title>Phil.</title> p. 252,
            K&uuml;hner <title>Gr. Gr.</title> II p. 164, and cf. <bibl n="Plat. Phaedo 73A"><title>Phaed.</title> 73 A</bibl>
            <foreign lang="greek">οὐκ ἂν οἷοί τ’ ἦσαν τοῦτο ποιήσειν</foreign> (so the

          <p>I formerly (with Bekker and others) printed <foreign lang="greek">οὐδ’

            in itself. The same may be said of (3) and (4). I have now followed Stallbaum in
            supposing that <foreign lang="greek">τί</foreign> was accidentally omitted after the
              <foreign lang="greek">-ει</foreign> of <foreign lang="greek">μέλει</foreign>. Such a
            slip is easy enough, and would be most likely to be corrected by the introduction of a
            negative, as in (2) and (3). Moreover, as Stallbaum says, <foreign lang="greek">τί καὶ
              ἡμῖν</foreign> &ldquo;huius sermonis alacritati plane est
            accommodatum,&rdquo; and <foreign lang="greek">καί</foreign> is, I think,
            sufficiently justified by the obvious contrast between the gods and ourselves. Tucker
            objects that &lsquo;&ldquo;If the gods do <hi rend="italic">not</hi> care, why
            should we <hi rend="italic">also</hi> care?&rdquo; is as bad in Greek as in
            English&rsquo;: but <foreign lang="greek">καί</foreign> is hardly so much as
            &lsquo;also&rsquo;: it merely points the contrast. Cf. III 414 E note There is
            no difficulty in <foreign lang="greek">οὐκοῦν</foreign> followed by a question, so
            long as the question is merely rhetorical. Hermann proposes <foreign lang="greek">οὔκουνκαὶ ἡμῖν μελητέον</foreign>, but the negative would require to
            be reinforced before <foreign lang="greek">ἡμῖν</foreign>. I can see no probability in
            Tucker's conjecture, viz. <foreign lang="greek">οὐκοῦν&lt;οὐδὲν&gt; καὶ ἡμῖν μελητέον</foreign>. <pb n="130"/>

              of a good comrade, either for his comrade's sake or for his own. Homer offends against
              this canon when he represents Achilles and Priam as indulging in lamentations over
              their dead; and still more when he makes the gods, and even the greatest of the gods,

            scarcely separated the dead body from the surviving spirit: the latter still lived where
            the body lay &lsquo;within the ground.&rsquo; Hence &lsquo;those within the
            ground&rsquo; (opposed to the <foreign lang="greek">ἐπιχθόνιοι</foreign> or
            living) became an expression for the spirits of the departed, and the denizens of the
            lower world in general: see <title>Il.</title> XV 188, XX 61. The Scholiast's derivation
            is more probable than that of Brugmann, who (<title>Grundriss</title> II p. 180) derives
            the word from <foreign lang="greek">ἐν</foreign> and a nominal suffix <foreign lang="greek">-ερο</foreign>. Plato at any rate would have preferred the Scholiast. On

            nowhere else in Plato (except of course in combination with superlatives, e.g. III 412
            B, VI 484 C), though found in Aristotle (<title>Pol.</title> E 11. 1313^{a} 39, where

            supposes the words to be a gloss by some Christian reader, meaning &lsquo;as
            he&rsquo; (i.e Plato) &lsquo;imagines.&rsquo; The author of the gloss wished
            to indicate that he at least could hear such tales without shivering. After <foreign lang="greek">ὡς οἴεται</foreign> found its way into the text, it was probably
            altered to <foreign lang="greek">οἴονται</foreign> (to suit the plural <foreign lang="greek">ἀκούοντας</foreign>), from which <foreign lang="greek">οἷόν

            far as it associates heat with cowardice, the comparison breaks down, for heat meant
            courage to the Greeks. For this reason Stephanus conjectured <foreign lang="greek">ἀθερμότεροι</foreign> and Ast <foreign lang="greek">ἀθυμότεροι</foreign>, a

The rhetorical repetition of <foreign lang="greek">ἥκιστ’ ἄρα</foreign> proves that like <foreign lang="greek">στερηθῆναι</foreign> they should be under the government either of <foreign lang="greek">δεινόν</foreign> itself, or of some notion supplied out of <foreign lang="greek">δεινόν</foreign>. As the former alternative gives the wrong sense we
            must, if the text is sound, take refuge in the latter. Hartman by a <hi rend="italic">tour de force</hi> resolves <foreign lang="greek">ἥκιστα δεινόν</foreign> into
              <foreign lang="greek">ἥκιστα εἰκὸς αὐτὸν δεδιέναι</foreign>, and carries on the
              <foreign lang="greek">εἰκός</foreign>. It would be somewhat easier, I think, though
            still very harsh, to supply <foreign lang="greek">δεινός</foreign> out of <foreign lang="greek">δεινόν, δεινός</foreign> being used as in <foreign lang="greek">δεινὸς
              καταράσασθαι τῷ λίθῳ</foreign> (Theophr. <title>Char.</title> 15, cf. infra 395
            C): but it is difficult not to believe that the text is corrupt. In <hi rend="italic">q</hi>, <foreign lang="greek">καί</foreign> has been corrected to <foreign lang="greek">χρή</foreign>, and the insertion of <foreign lang="greek">δεῖ</foreign>
            before <foreign lang="greek">καί</foreign> is suggested by Hartman. The question
            however is not what the good man ought to do, but what he actually does, and for this
            reason Richards' <foreign lang="greek">ἔοικε</foreign> after <foreign lang="greek">ὀδύρεσθαι</foreign> is better, although otherwise unlikely. Stallbaum's alternative
            proposal to read <foreign lang="greek">ὀδύρεται, φέρει δέ</foreign> seems to me far
            the best both in point of sense, and because it might easily pass into <foreign lang="greek">ὀδύρεσθαι, φέρειν δέ</foreign> under the influence of <foreign lang="greek">στερηθῆναι</foreign>. For these reasons I have printed it in the text.

            Achilles sorrowing for Patroclus in <title>Iliad</title> XXIV 10&mdash;12. Plato
            accommodates the Homeric narrative to his own <foreign lang="greek">ποιεῖν</foreign>,
            and reads <foreign lang="greek">πλωΐζοντ’  ἀτρυγέτοιο</foreign> instead
            of <foreign lang="greek">δινεύεσκ’ ἀλύων παρὰ θῖν’ ἁλός</foreign>, which appears
            in our Homer. <foreign lang="greek">πλωίζω</foreign> elsewhere is always used of
              sail<pb n="135"/> ing in the literal sense (yet <foreign lang="greek">ἐκ τοῦ νοῦ
              ἐκπλώειν</foreign> in Hdt. VI 12), but it cannot bear such a meaning here. If the
            MSS are right, <foreign lang="greek">πλωΐζοντ̓</foreign> must be regarded (with
            Schneider) as a metaphor, the agitated movements of Achilles being compared to the
            unsteady motion of a ship upon the sea. Achilles is so to speak &lsquo;at
            sea&rsquo; and shews it in his gait; cf. the metaphorical sense of <foreign lang="greek">χειμάζομαι</foreign>. The picture savours of the burlesque, and Howes
            suggests that <foreign lang="greek">πλωίζων</foreign> may be a deliberate parody on
            Plato's part (<title>Harvard Studies</title> etc. VI p. 202). As no other example of
            such a use of <foreign lang="greek">πλωίζω</foreign> has been adduced, the word is
            perhaps corrupt. Heyne's <foreign lang="greek">πρωΐζοντ̓</foreign>
            &ldquo;matutinum se agentem&rdquo; (<foreign lang="greek">οὐδέ μιν
            ἠὼς</foreign> &verbar; <foreign lang="greek">φαινομένη λήθεσκεν ὑπεὶρ
            ἅλα</foreign>, says Homer) will never command a wide assent: still less <foreign lang="greek">πλώϊσοντ̓</foreign> (Benedictus), <foreign lang="greek">πρῲ
            ἴοντ̓</foreign> (Ast), whose quantity is not above suspicion, or <foreign lang="greek">πρῲ ἰύζοντ̓</foreign> (Liebhold <title>Fl. Jahrb.</title> 1888, p. 108). <foreign lang="greek">αἰάζοντ̓</foreign> (Herwerden and Naber) is better in point of sense,
            but the alteration is too great. I have thought of <foreign lang="greek">πόλλ’
              ᾤζοντ̓</foreign> (<foreign lang="greek">ᾤζεις</foreign> &lsquo;cry <foreign lang="greek">ὤ</foreign>&rsquo; and not <foreign lang="greek">ὤζεις</foreign>
            is the spelling of the Codex Mediceus in <bibl n="Aesch. Eum. 124">Aesch.
              <title>Eum.</title> 124</bibl>), or <foreign lang="greek">ἀφλοίζοντ̓</foreign> (cf.
              <foreign lang="greek">ἀφλοισμός</foreign> in <title>Il.</title> XV 607). Perhaps,
            however, <foreign lang="greek">πλωΐζοντ̓</foreign> conceals some word meaning
            &lsquo;to rush wildly from his tent,&rsquo; <foreign lang="greek">ἐπὶ
            θῖν̓</foreign> being probably for <foreign lang="greek">ἐπὶ θῖνα</foreign>, not for
              <foreign lang="greek">ἐπὶ θινί</foreign>. There is apparently a contrast between
            Achilles' anguish within his tent and without, and some word is needed to mark his exit.
            Nothing can be made of the variant <foreign lang="greek">πλάζοντ̓</foreign> (in a few

          <p>392C - 394D We have now finished our treatment of the subject-matter of poetry, and
            have next to discuss its form. All composition is in a certain sense narrative,
            narrating things past, present or future. Narration in this sense may be either (1)
            simple and unmixed, (2) imitative, (3) both simple and imitative. Homer furnishes <pb n="144"/> an example of the third kind: his poetry is purely narrative, when he is
            speaking in propria persona, it is imitative, when he puts his words into the mouth of
            any of his characters. Tragedy and Comedy exemplify the imitative style. The best
            example of the purely narrative is the Dithyramb, of the third or mixed variety, the
            Epic. Which of these forms shall we admit, and on what occasions?</p>
          <p>ff. That Poetry and Art are a species of <foreign lang="greek">μίμησις</foreign>, was
            an accepted canon in Greece even before the time of Plato: see Butcher <hi rend="italic">Aristotle's Theory of Poetry and Fine Art</hi>^{2} p. 121. Starting from this
            principle, Plato gradually deepens and intensifies the connotation of <foreign lang="greek">μίμησις</foreign> as the dialogue advances. At first, the word denotes a
            specific variety of style&mdash; the dramatic as opposed to the narrative (392
            D&mdash;394 D). But as according to Plato style is at once the expression of, and
            also exercises a reflex influence on, the soul (400 D note), <foreign lang="greek">μίμησις</foreign> begins to assume an ethical import and is used to express
            imitation or assimilation in matters appertaining to or bearing upon character and
            conduct (394 E, 395 C notes: cf. also 401 B&mdash;404 C). Finally, in Book X, after
            the psychological point of view has been superseded by the metaphysical, the word
            acquires an ontological or metaphysical significance: see on X 595 C. On the subject
            generally, reference may be made to the dissertation of Abeken <hi rend="italic">de</hi>

            aright, as we may see from the special instances of poetical composition and acting. The
            sole duty of our guardians is to make and keep the city free; if they practise imitation

            say, men of brave and virtuous character, for imitation means assimilation. Dramatic
            poetry continually offends against this canon. In general, the good man will not make
            use of imitation except when he is narrating the sayings or deeds of the virtuous, or
            some lapse of the vicious into virtue, or sometimes in mere play. His style of speech
            will combine plain narrative and imitation, but he will use the latter sparingly;
            whereas the bad man will imitate more often than narrate, and no kind of imitation will
            come amiss to him. In respect of mode and time, the language of Virtue will be nearly

            theoretically, therefore, and ideally, the tragedian is also capable of writing a

            The reading <foreign lang="greek">μιμήματά τε</foreign> represents the correction

            distance from its noun (e.g. <foreign lang="greek">ὁ δέ γε, οἶμαι, ἦν δ’ ἐγώ,
              καταληφθεὶς θανάτῳ δίδοται</foreign> VIII 566 C), I still prefer the former view.
            Some may be inclined to regard <foreign lang="greek">μέτριος ἀνήρ</foreign> as a
            gloss. I have sometimes been tempted to make <foreign lang="greek">μοι δοκεῖ</foreign>
            parenthetical (exactly=&lsquo;methinks&rsquo;), in which case <foreign lang="greek">ὁ μέν</foreign> can easily be connected with <foreign lang="greek">μέτριος</foreign>. The idiom occurs in <bibl n="Plat. Phaedo 108D"><title>Phaed.</title> 108 D</bibl>

            Homer's in partaking of all three varieties. This is a cumbrous and unnecessary

              <foreign lang="greek">θεῖος ἀνήρ</foreign>, is now elaborated with ironical
            politeness. The images of the gods were anointed, and crowned with garlands, not only on
            great occasions (cf. Cic. <title>Verr.</title> IV 77), but also at other times,
            according to Proclus, who remarks on this passage <foreign lang="greek">μύρον
            αὐτῆς</foreign> (sc. <foreign lang="greek">τῆς ποιητικῆς</foreign>) <foreign lang="greek">καταχέας, ὡς τῶν ἐν τοῖς ἁγιωτάτοις ἱεροῖς ἀγαλμάτων θέμις,

              (<hi rend="italic">in remp.</hi> p. 42 ed. Kroll). Schneider aptly compares Paus. X
            24. 6 <foreign lang="greek">τούτου</foreign> (a sacred stone) <foreign lang="greek">καὶ ἔλαιον ὁσημέραι καταχέουσι καὶ κατὰ ἑορτὴν ἑκάστην ἔρια
              ἐπιτιθέασι τὰ ἀργά</foreign>. For other illustrations see Frazer on Paus. l.c.,
            and Munro on Lucr. v 1199. Apropos of the present passage, Dio Chrysostom and other
            ancient writers cited by Ast refer to the anointing of swallows by Greek women: <foreign lang="greek">καὶ κελεύει μάλα εἰρωνικῶς</foreign> (so Ast: MSS <foreign lang="greek">εἰρηνικῶς</foreign>) <foreign lang="greek">στέψαντας αὐτὸν ἐρίῳ
              καὶ μύρῳ καταχέαντας ἀφιέναι παρ’ ἄλλους· τοῦτο δὲ αἱ γυναῖκες ἐπὶ τῶν
              χελιδόν ων ποιοῦσι</foreign> (Dio Chr. <title>Or.</title> 53 p. 276 ed. Reiske). To
            this custom Ast supposes that Plato is alluding, the poets being as it were faithless
            and garrulous swallows (cf. <foreign lang="greek">χελιδόνων μουσεῖα</foreign>), as
            well as to the Pythagorean precept &lsquo;not to admit swallows into the
            house&rsquo; (Plut. <title>Symp.</title> VIII 727 B ff.), on which see Frazer in
              <title>Cl. Rev.</title> V pp. 1&mdash;3. This explanation lends an additional
            point to <foreign lang="greek">ἀποπέμποιμεν</foreign>: and <foreign lang="greek">προσκυνοῖμεν</foreign> might fairly be interpreted of the joyful salutations with
            which the Greeks hailed the advent of the swallow in the spring (see e.g. Baumeister
              <title>Denk. d. Kl. Alterth.</title> p. 1985). G. B. Hussey <pb n="155"/>
              (<title>Proceedings of the American Philol. Association</title> Vol. XXII pp. xliii
            ff.) thinks that Plato has in his mind the wellknown <foreign lang="greek">χελιδονισμός</foreign> of which we read in Athenaeus (VIII 360 B ff.), remarking that
            in the swallow song &lsquo;the custom seems to have been to carry some sort of
            symbolic swallow from house to house.&rsquo; It is perhaps more probable (as Mr J.
            G. Frazer suggests to me) that &ldquo;the ceremony of anointing the swallows and
            crowning them with wool was performed on the children who went from door to door in
            spring, singing the swallow song and apparently personating the swallow.&rdquo; But
            the tone of the whole passage, with its air of studiously exaggerated politeness and
            compliment, as well as the particular expressions <foreign lang="greek">προσκυνοῖμεν,
              ἱερόν</foreign>, and <foreign lang="greek">θαυμαστόν</foreign>, are strongly in
            favour of Proclus' interpretation, although Plato's thoughts may have dwelt for a moment
            on the practices connected with the <foreign lang="greek">χελιδονισμός</foreign> when
            he wrote the words <foreign lang="greek">ἀποπέμποιμεν

          <p>398C - 399E We have now to treat of lyric poetry. Song involves three factors, viz.
            words, a certain musical mode, and a certain movement or time. Our regulations about
            words when unaccompanied by music apply equally to words when sung, and the musical mode
            and time must conform to the words. Now we proscribed all lamentation in our city, so
            that we must exclude the lugubrious modes; and those which are relaxing in their effects
            must be rejected on similar grounds. In short, we shall retain two modes and no more,
            one to imitate the brave man's utterances in times of stress and strain, the other to
            imitate his accents in seasons of peace and calm. We shall deal similarly with
            instruments of music, forbidding all those which lend themselves to a variety of modes.

            poetry also on its formal side. Now the chief formal characteristic of lyric poetry is
            its invariable association with music. It is therefore necessary to lay down canons for
            musical composition. This is the justification for the sections on
            &lsquo;harmony&rsquo; and rhythm, which are wrongly pronounced to be irrelevant

            remains of Greek Music. The account of <title>Die Musik der Griechen</title> by
            Gleditsch in Iwan M&uuml;ller's <title>Handbuch</title> will be found a useful and

            Kralik's recent monograph <title>Altgriechische Musik</title> (Stuttgart und Wien) is
            interesting, but too slight to be of much service. Taken by itself, the language of
            Plato in this chapter seems to me to point to the existence of four leading or simple
            modes, viz. Dorian, Phrygian, Lydian and Ionian (the last two having each two varieties,
            a <foreign lang="greek">σύντονος</foreign> and a <foreign lang="greek">χαλαρά</foreign>), and one composite mode, the Mixolydian. See App. II.</p>
          <p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">τρόπου</lemma>. Hartman suggests <foreign lang="greek">τρόπον</foreign>, in view of <foreign lang="greek">τὸ περὶ

            Greek music, lyric poetry was written only for music, and music only for poetry, the
            separation of the two being condemned as illegitimate: see Monro l.c. pp. 119, 120. The
            elements of music are <foreign lang="greek">ῥυθμός</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">ἀρμονία</foreign>. The former &lsquo;reconciles&rsquo; <foreign lang="greek">ταχύ</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">βραδύ</foreign> by arranging a
            proper sequence of short and long notes and syllables, the latter <foreign lang="greek">ὀξύ</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">βαρύ</foreign> by a proper arrangement of
            notes of higher and lower pitch (<bibl n="Plat. Sym. 187A"><title>Symp.</title> 187
            A</bibl>&mdash;C). In the wider sense, therefore, any <foreign lang="greek">ὁμολογία</foreign> of <foreign lang="greek">ὀξύ</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">βαρὐ</foreign> is a <foreign lang="greek">ἁρμονία</foreign>, but in
            practice the word was used specifically of certain scales or modes, and it is in this
            sense (according to Westphal) that Plato uses it here and in 398 E, where see note.</p>

            Rev.</title> X pp. 378 f. We learn from Aristotle that certain musical critics censured
            Plato for rejecting <foreign lang="greek">τὰς ἀνειμένας ἁρμονίας</foreign> and for

            <foreign lang="greek">Θ</foreign> 7. 1342^{b} 3). Plato, however, rejects the flute,
            not because it is orgiastic, but because it is <foreign lang="greek">πολυαρμόνιον</foreign> (399 D). In Plato's opinion the Phrygian mode expressed
            sobriety and resignation: Aristotle thought it ecstatic and purgative (l.c. 1341^{a}
            23). The difference of view is interesting and important as shewing that the ethical

            <foreign lang="greek">. ἐπέχοντα</foreign>&mdash;see cr. n.&mdash; cannot, I
            think, be right. <foreign lang="greek">ἐπέχειν τὴν διάνοιαν</foreign>
            (<title>Laws</title> 926 B) certainly does not justify <foreign lang="greek">ἐπέχειν
              ἑαυτόν</foreign>, and even if it did, &lsquo;submitting to&rsquo; and not
            merely &lsquo;attending to&rsquo; is the sense required. With <foreign lang="greek">ὑπέχοντα</foreign> cf. <bibl n="Plat. Gorg. 497B"><title>Gorg.</title>
              497 B</bibl>
            <foreign lang="greek">ὑπόσχες Σωκράτει ἐξελέγξαι ὅπως ἄν βούληται</foreign>,
            where the reflexive pronoun is omitted, as often with <foreign lang="greek">παρέχειν</foreign>. Here it is better to take <foreign lang="greek">ἑαυτόν</foreign>
            with <foreign lang="greek">ὑπέχοντα</foreign> than with <foreign lang="greek">μεταπείθοντι</foreign>. By changing the construction and writing accusatives instead
            of genitives, Plato makes the man himself rather than his <foreign lang="greek">φθόγγοι</foreign> appear the object of imitation (cf. 397 D note). This is natural
            enough, because the situations described in <foreign lang="greek">ἢ
              τοὐναντίονἀγαπῶντα</foreign> give less scope for <foreign lang="greek">φθόγγοι</foreign>. Stephanus wished to read the genitive throughout (<foreign lang="greek">ὑπέχοντος, πράξαντος</foreign> etc.: so also <hi rend="italic">v</hi>
            and two Florentine MSS), but there is also inscriptional evidence for a genitive or

          <p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ταύτας -- λεῖπε</lemma>. The style is intentionally
            weighty and formal, as befits a solemn pronouncement: cf. X 617 D, E. After <foreign lang="greek">ταύτας</foreign> there is a slight pause: &lsquo;Just these, two
            modes and none other.&rsquo; The insertion of <foreign lang="greek">τάς</foreign>
            would impair the effect. besides suggesting that Socrates had in view two of the current
            modes, which, not being himself <foreign lang="greek">μουσικός</foreign>, he
            professedly had not. It is Glauco's business to fit the cap (398 E, 399 A); Socrates
            only makes it. The indefinite <foreign lang="greek">αἵτινες</foreign> (before <foreign lang="greek">φθόγγους</foreign>) is therefore strictly appropriate in the mouth of
            Socrates, although it would not be in Glauco's. <foreign lang="greek">ἁρμονίας</foreign> is rejected by Herwerden in both places (see cr. n.), but it is
            almost as indispensable here as it is wrong after <foreign lang="greek">ἀνδρείων</foreign>, although Stallbaum rejects the word here and retains it there.
            The genitives <foreign lang="greek">δυστυχούντων</foreign> etc. must depend on <foreign lang="greek">φθόγγους</foreign>. For <foreign lang="greek">βίαιον,
            ἑκούσιον</foreign> (&lsquo;one involuntary, one voluntary&rsquo;), Ast
            suggests <foreign lang="greek">βιαίου, ἑκουσίου</foreign>, Hartman <foreign lang="greek">βιαίων ἑκουσίων</foreign>. A human being cannot however be called
              <foreign lang="greek">βίαιος</foreign> because he is engaged <foreign lang="greek">ἐν βιαίῳ πράξει</foreign>, although the mode which imitates his accents may be so
            described with propriety and even elegance: cf. (with Schneider) such expressions as
              <foreign lang="greek">φόνος ξυγγενής</foreign> for the slaughter of kindred. The
            words <foreign lang="greek">δυστυχούντωνκάλλιστα</foreign> simply define
            the meaning of <foreign lang="greek">βίαιον</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">ἑκούσιον</foreign> (&lsquo;whatever musical modes they be that shall best
            imitate the accents of&rsquo; etc.): the relative is postponed in order to keep the
            essential marks of the <foreign lang="greek">ἁρμονίαι</foreign> together, but the
            careful reader will note that Plato begins a chiasmus with <foreign lang="greek">δυστυχούντων</foreign>, as if to separate the genitives from what precedes and
            prepare us to <pb n="159"/> find their construction in the sequel. Had he written
              <foreign lang="greek">εὐτυχούντων, δυστυχούντων, ἀνδρείων, σωφρόνων</foreign>
            the double chiasmus would have compelled us to connect the genitives with <foreign lang="greek">δύο ἁρμονίας</foreign>.</p>
          <p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">οὐκ ἄλλας -- ἔλεγον</lemma>. The Dorian to
            express <foreign lang="greek">ἀνδρεία</foreign>, the Phrygian <foreign lang="greek">σωφροσύνη</foreign>. These are the two contrasting virtues which Plato's <foreign lang="greek">μουσική</foreign> endeavours to combine (410 E).</p>
          <p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">παναρμονίου</lemma>. In Plato the noun <foreign lang="greek">παναρμόνιον</foreign> occurs only here and in 404 D <foreign lang="greek">ᾠδῇ τῇ ἐν τῷ παναρμονίῳ καὶ ἐν πᾶσι ῥυθμοῖς
            πεποιημένη</foreign>. In the latter passage it certainly does not denote a musical
            instrument of any kind. Here the word is sometimes understood of a particular and
            definite musical instrument, but a careful study of the context shews that it does not
            bear this meaning even here. Plato has decided to admit only two modes, the Dorian and
            the Phrygian. &lsquo;Consequently,&rsquo; he continues, &lsquo;we shall have
            no need in our songs and melodies of <foreign lang="greek">πολυχορδία</foreign> or
              <foreign lang="greek">παναρμόνιον</foreign>, and <hi rend="italic">therefore</hi>
              (<foreign lang="greek">ἄρα</foreign>) we shall dispense with <foreign lang="greek">τρίγωνοι, πηκτίδες</foreign> etc., with all instruments, in short, which are
              <foreign lang="greek">πολύχορδα</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">πολυαρμόνια</foreign>.&rsquo; The prohibition of certain musical instruments is an
            inference from the general principle that <foreign lang="greek">πολυχορδία</foreign>
            and <foreign lang="greek">παναρμόνιον</foreign> are unnecessary, so that <foreign lang="greek">παναρμόνιον</foreign> cannot itself be a particular musical instrument.
            Probably, as Mr Archer-Hind has suggested to me, the <foreign lang="greek">παναρμόνιον</foreign> was &ldquo;not a mode or modes, but a style of composition,
            in which the &lsquo;Tondichter&rsquo; passed freely from <foreign lang="greek">δωριστί</foreign> to <foreign lang="greek">φρυγιστί</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">λυδιστί</foreign> and as many others as he chose. The name may even have
            been given to well-known compositions in this style&mdash;cf. <foreign lang="greek">νόμος πολυκέφαλος</foreign>&mdash;the fantasia with many subjects. The effect,
            I should think, may have been analogous to a series of bold and sudden modulations in
            modern music.&rdquo; See also on <foreign lang="greek">αὐτὰ τὰ

            in question, and there is the usual crop of emendations, intended to obliterate the

              <title>Greek Melic Poets</title> p. 326. Here the metaphor is intended to arrest
            attention by its boldness and prepare us for the theory of the origin of <foreign lang="greek">παναρμόνια</foreign> in the next clause; but <foreign lang="greek">πολυχορδότατον</foreign> in itself, like <foreign lang="greek">πάμφωνος</foreign>
            in Pindar (<title>Pyth.</title> 12. 19 al.), refers only to the number of different
            notes which the flute, thanks to various contrivances, such as plugs, wax, etc., was

            of strings and notes as admitting and even inviting change and fusion of modes. We are
            told by Paus. IX 12. 5 (cited by Monro l.c. p. 38: cf. Ath. XIV 631 E) that it was one

              <foreign lang="greek">τρίγωνοι</foreign>. Plato means those instruments on which
            panharmonic melodies could be played (cf. Proclus <hi rend="italic">in remp.</hi> p. 63
            ed. Kroll): but we must beware of translating (with D. and V.) &lsquo;the
            panharmonium itself,&rsquo; for no single specific instrument is here intended, as
            some later lexicographers appear to have supposed. The gloss in Hesychius <foreign lang="greek">παναρμόνιον· εἶδος ὀργάνου, ἐξ ὅλου τεταγμένον</foreign> is not
            quite clear, and may conceivably refer to a whole class of instruments, but Photius
            apparently thought that there was a special instrument called <foreign lang="greek">παναρμόνιον</foreign>. His note (p. 388, 26 ed. Porson) is as follows: <foreign lang="greek">παναρμόνιον· ὄργανον μουσικόν· Ἄλεξις, ἐν ᾧ τὸ παναρμόνιον
              τὸ καινὸν ἔντεινον τεχνῶν</foreign> (<foreign lang="greek">Τέχνων</foreign>
            Meineke). Photius may of course be right in his interpretation of Alexis' line: but
              <foreign lang="greek">παναρμόνιον</foreign> in Plato never, I believe, refers to one
            particular instrument: and even Alexis may mean no more than &lsquo;perform the new
            panharmonic melody,&rsquo; <foreign lang="greek">ἐντείνω</foreign> being used as

        <div type="section" n="399E">
          <p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">οὐδέν γε -- ὀργάνων</lemma>. Plato puts himself
            in the position of the Muses, who preferred Apollo's performance on the <foreign lang="greek">κιθάρα</foreign> to that of Marsyas on the flute (Apollod. I 4. 2). This
            is the force of <foreign lang="greek">οὐδέν γε καινὸν ποιοῦμεν</foreign>. The words
              <foreign lang="greek">τὰ τοῦ Ἀπόλλωνος ὄργανα</foreign> must not be pressed;
            for although Apollo invented the cithara, the lyre was ascribed to Hermes (Paus. V 14.
            8: cf. the Homeric <title>Hymn to Hermes</title>), and the syrinx to Pan. The discovery
            of the flute was also ascribed to Athena, especially by the Boeotians. A third account
            represents Marsyas as picking up the instrument after Athena had discovered and
            discarded it. This legend may be an attempt to reconcile the two conflicting stories,
            and probably dates from the decline of the flute as an instrument of education in Athens
            during the fourth century (Arist. <title>Pol.</title>

          <p>399E - 401A Let us now continue the purgation of our city by laying down rules for
            rhythm and time. Our rhythm must not be varied or manifold; for time as well as tune
            should conform to words, and not conversely. It is agreed that there are certain rhythms
            expressive of sobriety and courage. These and these only will be admitted into our city.
            For particulars, we shall apply to Damon; but we can enunciate the general principle
            ourselves. Rhythm and Mode reflect style, and style expresses character. It is to
            promote the growth of character that we shall require the young to pursue the beautiful
            throughout the realms alike of Art and Nature.</p>
          <p>The section on Rhythms is hardly less difficult than that on Modes. Westphal translates
            it with a short commentary in his <title>Gr. Rhythmik</title> pp. 237&mdash;239, but
            without shedding any light upon the darkest places. Schneider and Stallbaum give little
            help. I have found Gleditsch's summary account of <hi rend="italic">die Metrik der
              Griechen</hi> (in Iwan M&uuml;ller's <title>Handbuch</title>) a most useful guide
            in dealing with the subject.</p>
          <p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">βάσεις</lemma>. The word <foreign lang="greek">βάσις</foreign> in the technical writers on Rhythm generally means a dipody or
            combination of two feet under one main ictus: cf. Schol. in Heph. I 3. 1 p. 124 ed.
            Westphal <foreign lang="greek">βάσις δέ ἐστι τὸ ἐκ δύο ποδῶν συνεστηκός, τοῦ
              μὲν ἄρσει, τοῦ δὲ θέσει παραλαμβανομένου</foreign>. Such a technical use of the
            word would be out of place here, especially in the mouth of Socrates; and the word is
            employed throughout as equivalent simply to &lsquo;step&rsquo; or
            &lsquo;foot.&rsquo; Even technical writers sometimes so use it: cf. the
            Scholiast already cited <foreign lang="greek">δέξεται δὲ</foreign> (sc. the Iambic
            metre) <foreign lang="greek">ἐν μὲν τῇ πρώτῃ βάσει ἴαμβον καὶ
            σπονδεῖον</foreign> II 5. p. 151 and Gleditsch l.c. p. 702.</p>
          <p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">κοσμίου τε καὶ ἀνδρείου</lemma> recalls 399 C
              <foreign lang="greek">σωφρόνων ἀνδρείων</foreign>, and would seem to point to the
            necessity of two kinds of rhythm, one to go with the Phrygian mode and express sobriety
            and self-control, the other to join the Dorian mode in expressing courage. On the
            ethical qualities of Greek rhythm in general, consult Westphal <title>Gr.
            Rhythmik</title> pp. 226&mdash;239 and Arist. <title>Rhet.</title> III 8, with

            given: 1. the intervals of the fourth, fifth, octave, and <pb n="162"/> double octave
            (Ast): 2. the four notes of the tetrachord, which was probably the historical and at all
            events the &lsquo;theoretical unit of the scale&rsquo; (Stallbaum, Jowett and
            Campbell): 3. &ldquo;the four ratios which give the primary musical
            intervals&mdash;viz. the ratios 2:1, 3:2, 4:3 and 9:8, which give the octave, fifth,
            fourth, and tone&rdquo; (Monro l.c. p. 106 note; cf. also <title>Dict. Ant.</title>
            II p. 193): 4. the four <foreign lang="greek">ἁρμονίαι Φρυγιστί, Λυδιστί,
              Δωριστί, Λοκριστί</foreign> (Westphal <title>Rhythmik</title> p. 238). Ast's view
            cannot be right, unless we suppose that <foreign lang="greek">ἁρμονίαι</foreign> here
            includes scales of double compass, which is most unlikely. Westphal's explanation is
            improbable, for Plato has said nothing of <foreign lang="greek">Λοκριστί</foreign>,
            and (though perhaps no great stress should be laid on this) it is awkward to derive the
              <foreign lang="greek">ἁρμονίαι</foreign> (<foreign lang="greek">ὅθεν αἱ πᾶσαι
              ἁρμονίαι</foreign>) from themselves. If the principle of Westphal's interpretation
            is right, I should be inclined to substitute <foreign lang="greek">Ἰαστί</foreign>
            for <foreign lang="greek">Λοκριστί</foreign>, having regard to 398 E, where see note
            Cf. <title>Cl. Rev.</title> X p. 379. (I have since found that Prantl also took this
            view: see note 116 in his translation.) I do not think that Stallbaum has hit the truth,
            for Plato's language is not suggestive of any allusion to the origin of the octave from
            the combination of two tetrachords, and a single tetrachord cannot produce a <foreign lang="greek">ἁρμονία</foreign> (<foreign lang="greek">ὅθεν αἱ πᾶσαι
            ἁρμονίαι</foreign>). Possibly the <foreign lang="greek">τέτταρα εἴδη ἐν τοῖς
              φθόγγοις</foreign> denote simply the keynote, its octave, and the intervals of a tone
            and a semitone: for these are as it were the threads out of which all modes
            &lsquo;are woven&rsquo; (<foreign lang="greek">πλέκονται</foreign> should be
            repeated with <foreign lang="greek">ἁρμονίαι</foreign>), the difference between the
            modes depending on the difference in position of the tones and semitones. But Euclid
            lays the greatest stress upon the ratios 3:2 and 4:3 as the component elements of the
            octave: see for example <title>Sect. Can.</title> 6 <foreign lang="greek">τὸ διπλάσιον

          <p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">οἶμαι δέ με κτλ.</lemma> Schneider's <foreign lang="greek">δέ γε</foreign> (found in some inferior MSS) is not appropriate here.
            The superfluous pronoun after <foreign lang="greek">οἶμαι</foreign> is a
            well-established colloquialism: cf. <bibl n="Plat. Charm. 173A"><title>Charm.</title>
              173 A</bibl>, <bibl n="Plat. Sym. 175E"><title>Symp.</title> 175 E</bibl>. <foreign lang="greek">οἶμαι, ἀκηκοέναι</foreign>, and <foreign lang="greek">οὐ σαφῶς
              ὀνομάζοντος</foreign> are just the words one might employ in giving one's
            recollections of an abstruse and half-understood lecture, and this is just what Plato is
            either doing or, more probably, affecting to do. A few technical terms and a vague idea
              (<foreign lang="greek">οὐκ οἶδ’ ὅπως</foreign>) of some of the processes are all
            that he remembers.</p>
          <p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ἐνόπλιον -- ήρῷόν γε</lemma>
            <foreign lang="greek">. ἐνόπλιος ξύνθετος, δάκτυλος, ἡρῷος</foreign> are
            expressions from the lecture: in English they would be in inverted commas. The <foreign lang="greek">ἐνόπλιος</foreign> is not <foreign lang="greek"/>
            (Proclus <hi rend="italic">in remp.</hi> p. 61, if, as appears probable, by <foreign lang="greek">παριαμβίς</foreign> he means the <foreign lang="greek">παρίαμβος</foreign> or pyrrich), nor the cretic (J. and C.), nor, strictly speaking,
            the anapaestic foot (Hartman), but <foreign lang="greek">&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;</foreign>,
            a common processional <pb n="163"/> (<foreign lang="greek">προσοδιακός</foreign>) or
            marching rhythm, consisting of an <foreign lang="greek">ἰωνικὸς ἀπὸ
            μείζονος</foreign> and a choriambus (Hephaestion c. 15), or (as the Scholiast on <bibl n="Aristoph. Cl. 651">Ar. <title>Clouds</title> 651</bibl> measures it) a spondee,
            pyrrich, trochee and iambus. For examples we may cite Sappho's <foreign lang="greek">αὔτα δὲ σὺ Καλλιόπη</foreign> (<title>Fr.</title> 82) and Tyrtaeus' <foreign lang="greek">ἄγετ’ ὦ Σπάρτας ἔνοπλοι</foreign> (<title>Fr.</title> 16). See
            Gleditsch l.c. pp. 717, 722, and Bacchius <title>Isag.</title> 101 ed. von Jan, whose
            example is <foreign lang="greek">ὁ τὸν πίτυος στέφανον. ξύνθετος</foreign> probably
            refers to the composite character of the rhythm. as described, for example, by the
            Scholiast on the <title>Clouds.</title> The later technical expression for this
            peculiarity was <foreign lang="greek">ἐπισύνθετος</foreign> (Gleditsch p. 746).
              <foreign lang="greek">δάκτυλον</foreign> must be understood as a foot, not as a
            rhythm, although the <foreign lang="greek">ἐνόπλιος ξύνθετος</foreign> certainly, and
            probably also the <foreign lang="greek">ἡρῷος</foreign>, are rhythms. There is no
            difficulty about this, provided we remember that Plato is quoting (or pretending to
            quote) isolated technical expressions from Damon's lecture. The ingenious, though
            hazardous, proposal of Blaydes, to read <foreign lang="greek">καὶ &lt;κατὰ&gt;
              δάκτυλον</foreign> (cf. <title>Clouds</title> 651), would confine the instances to
            rhythms until we reach <foreign lang="greek">ἴαμβον</foreign>. Dr Jackson suggests
              <foreign lang="greek">δακτυλικόν</foreign> in place of <foreign lang="greek">δάκτυλον</foreign>. It is tempting (with J. and C.) to take <foreign lang="greek">ἡρῷος</foreign> as &lsquo;spondee,&rsquo; but there seems to be no
            authority for such a use of the word. The <foreign lang="greek">ἡρῷος πούς</foreign>
            is apparently a dactyl; although the <foreign lang="greek">ἡρῷος ῥυθμός</foreign>
            admits of the spondee. Unless, therefore, we take <foreign lang="greek">ἡρῷος</foreign> as a rhythm, the spondee seems to be altogether excluded. It is
            unnecessary to do more than allude to Hartman's excision of <foreign lang="greek">ξύνθετον καὶ δάκτυλον</foreign>.</p>

            remark that Plato uses <foreign lang="greek">τ ὸ ἄνω</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">τὸ κάτω</foreign> is misleading (<title>Rhythmik</title> p. 104). The
            words must be taken as adverbs, and can only be explained by supposing that when Damon
            was demonstrating the equality of arsis and thesis he
              &lsquo;placed&rsquo;&mdash;<foreign lang="greek">τιθέντος</foreign> is

            shews&mdash;the former in a diagram above the latter, in some such way as <foreign lang="greek">&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;</foreign>. The position of the ictus
              &mdash;<foreign lang="greek">ἄνω καὶ κάτω</foreign>, not <foreign lang="greek">κάτω καὶ ἄνω</foreign>&mdash;shews that Plato is speaking of the dactyl and
            spondee which replace the anapaest in the anapaestic rhythm: for in the dactylic rhythm
            proper the ictus falls on the first syllable (see Gleditsch p. 693). Now the <foreign lang="greek">ἐνόπλιος</foreign> is also anapaestic, so that it looks as if Damon had

              ἄγαν ὀρσολοπεῖται</foreign>, and analysed it into an <foreign lang="greek">ἐνόπλιος ξύνθἐτος</foreign>, a dactyl, and a spondee (included, as stated above,

          <p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">εἰς βραχύ -- γιγνόμενον</lemma>. These words can
            only mean &lsquo;passing into a short and a long,&rsquo; &ldquo;mit kurzem

            als auch in eine lange Silbe auslief&rdquo; (Prantl): see on II 380 D. The slight
            inaccuracy involved in saying <foreign lang="greek">γιγνόμενον</foreign>, where
              <foreign lang="greek">τελευτῶντα</foreign> (cf. VI 511 C) would have been more
            precise, is perhaps in keeping with the airy nonchalance of Socrates' description. The
            construction is missed by Westphal (<title>Rhythmik</title> p. 237) and the English
            translators and editors. <foreign lang="greek">γιγνόμενον</foreign> agrees with
              <foreign lang="greek">ἡρῷον</foreign>: the <foreign lang="greek">ἡρῷος ῥυθμὸς
              γίγνεται εἰς βραχύ</foreign> when it uses a dactyl, <foreign lang="greek">εἰς
              μακρόν</foreign> when it uses a spondee (or anapaest), the two alternatives being
            denoted by <foreign lang="greek">τε καί</foreign>. I have sometimes felt disposed to
            take the words as referring to the iambus, and place them just before <foreign lang="greek">ὡς ἐγὼ οἶμαι</foreign>, translating &lsquo;and when
            it&rsquo; (the rhythm) &lsquo;changed to a short and a long, I think he called
            it an iambus&rsquo;: but although this interpretation gives a somewhat better sense
            to <foreign lang="greek">γιγνόμενον</foreign>, I am not convinced that the MSS are
            wrong. Hartman also suggests the transposition of <foreign lang="greek">καί</foreign>,
            but he might have spared his &ldquo;minime audax coniectura&rdquo; <foreign lang="greek">ἐκ βραχέων τε καὶ μακρῶν γιγνόμενον</foreign>. See also the next
            note.</p>
          <p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">μήκη -- προσῆπτε</lemma>. Hartman takes these words
            as explaining the trochee only, laying emphasis on the precedence given to <foreign lang="greek">μήκη</foreign>; but the use of the plural shews that the iambus is also
            included. <pb n="164"/> The meaning is simply &lsquo;and he assigned them longs and
            shorts,&rsquo; i.e. to each one long, and one short. This clause is in favour of
            keeping <foreign lang="greek">εἰς βραχύγιγνόμενον</foreign> in its place;
            if we transpose (as suggested in the last note), the short and long of the iambus will
            be alluded to twice.</p>

            not always preserved by writers on metre (e.g. Bacchius <title>Isag.</title> 100 ff. ed.

          <p>401A - 403C To these canons not only poets but all other artists must conform. We shall
            admit no artists save only those who are able to track out the nature of the beautiful,
            and beguile our children even in their earliest years into unconscious harmony with the
            beauty of reason. The value of a musical training lies in its peculiar power of
            imparting grace and beauty to the soul. It enables the learner to discriminate between
            the fair and the foul in other spheres, admitting only that which is beautiful and fair,
            at first instinctively, but afterwards, when reason comes, with fullest consciousness,
            and joyful recognition of the beauty to which he is himself akin. No one is truly imbued
            with musical culture until he can recognise the originals of virtue wherever they are
            found, as well as their copies everywhere. Such an one will love supremely the union of
            a beautiful soul with physical beauty, but will let inner beauty atone in part for
            outward defect, and his passion will be pure from sensual taint. Our account of Music is
            now ended: for the end of Music is the love of Beauty.</p>

          <p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">τὴν τοῦ ἀγαθοῦ κτλ.</lemma> This famous section
            describes in glowing language, like that of the <title>Symposium</title>, Plato's ideal
            of art. He does not desire to banish art, as is sometimes asserted, but rather idealises
            it by effecting&mdash;as he believed&mdash;its reconciliation with beauty and
            truth. Art aspired to be <foreign lang="greek">καλόν</foreign> in his day: Plato wished
            it to be so in the fullest sense of the word: and his idea of beauty is sufficiently
            comprehensive to include moral and spiritual beauty as well as physical. Plato was
            doubtless unfair in the application of his principle to some of the Greek artists and
            poets, but in itself his ideal&mdash;the love of spiritual beauty &mdash;is one
            to which the best and most enduring art&mdash;which alone can find a place in an
            ideal city&mdash;consciously or unconsciously ever seeks to conform. See Nettleship

            painters and sculptors, and confined his assaults to the musicians and still more to the
            poets.&rdquo; This is true, although the present passage shews that his canons were
            intended to regulate painting, sculpture, architecture, and the minor arts as well as
            music and poetry. Among other reasons, Nettleship plausibly suggests that Plato
            &ldquo;did not see in the sculptors and architects of his time the signs of
            degeneracy which drew his attention to the poets and musicians.&rdquo; Cf. 401

            Epaminondas&mdash;himself a man of Platonic sympathies, if not a
            Platonist&mdash; hinted to his countrymen that their city could not be truly great

            believe that Plato wrote <foreign lang="greek">τις</foreign> and not <foreign lang="greek">τι</foreign> (see cr. n.). &lsquo;Whenever <hi rend="italic">anything</hi> strikes on their eyes or ears from fair works of art&rsquo; sounds
            material and gross in a passage so full of poetic feeling; and in the second place

            note), and many other critics, understand the word; nor can it be denied that the
            language of Plato, <hi rend="italic">if interpreted in the light of Book VII</hi>, can
            bear this meaning. Nevertheless we are bound in the first instance to interpret this
            passage by itself, and not by Book VII, the more so as the doctrine of transcendent or
            separate (<foreign lang="greek">χωρισταί</foreign>) Ideas appears nowhere else in
            I&mdash;IV, and seems to be expressly reserved by Plato for his philosophical, as
            distinct from his musical education (see IV 435 D and VI 504 B note). What is meant by
            the words <foreign lang="greek">εἰκόνας αὐτῶν</foreign>? The context shews
            conclusively that <foreign lang="greek">εἰκόνες</foreign> refers to copies (sc. of the
            virtues <foreign lang="greek">σωφροσύνη</foreign> etc.) represented in poetry and the
            fine arts (so also Krohn <title>Pl. Frage</title> p. 47). On any other interpretation
            the introduction of these <foreign lang="greek">εἰκόνες</foreign> is irrelevant in a
            discussion on the rules which imitative art must obey. This being so, if <foreign lang="greek">εἴδη</foreign> means the Ideas, Poetry will be a direct imitation of
            the Ideas, which is inconsistent with X 595 C &mdash;598 D. Or does Plato mean to
            suggest that Poetry and Art in his ideal city are really to imitate the Ideas directly?
            This is a bold and attractive solution, and there are several hints elsewhere to the
            same or nearly the same effect, but Plato expressly speaks of the <foreign lang="greek">εἴδη</foreign> here only as immanent, and not transcendent (<foreign lang="greek">ἐνόντα ἐν οἷς ἔνεστιν</foreign>), and we must therefore suppose that the
            artist copies from the life (cf. <foreign lang="greek">ἐν τῇ ψυχῇ καλὰ ἤθη
              ἐνόντα</foreign> D). The word <foreign lang="greek">εἴδη</foreign> is repeatedly
            used by Plato without reference to transcendent Ideas, as has been amply proved by Krohn
              (<title>Pl. St.</title> pp. 65, 66), Pfleiderer (<hi rend="italic">Zur
            L&ouml;sung</hi> etc. p. 17), and Campbell (II pp. 296 ff.). Here it does not mean
            &lsquo;varieties&rsquo; (as if there were more than one variety of <foreign lang="greek">σωφροσύνη</foreign>), but simply &lsquo;forms&rsquo; or
            &lsquo;kinds,&rsquo; in the sense in which the immanent reality which every
            general notion attempts to express is a &lsquo;form&rsquo; or
            &lsquo;kind&rsquo;&mdash;a genus or species&mdash;of the totality of
            things. Cf. IV 435 B note The genitives are genitives of definition. The use of <foreign lang="greek">εἴδη</foreign> in the sense of &ldquo;immanente
            Seinsformen&rdquo; (Krohn) is interesting as a harbinger of the Ideal theory of VI
            and VII&mdash;a sort of half-way house between the Socratic <foreign lang="greek">λόγοι</foreign> and Plato's ideas. It recurs in IV 434 D, 435 B, 437 D. See further
            Krohn <title>Pl. Frage</title> pp. 54&mdash;58, and cf. VI 504 D note But although
            the separatists have (as I think) made out their claim that transcendent Ideas do not
            appear in Books I&mdash;IV, I agree with Hirmer (<title>Entst. u. Komp. d. Pl.
            Pol.</title> p. 645) in thinking their deductions from this fact unwarrantable.</p>

            and more expressive, because it represents the object of affection almost as the lover's
            very son. It should be noted that in Plato's <foreign lang="greek">ἔρως</foreign> it
            is the elder who loves, and the younger who is loved; and that the aim and purpose of
            Platonic love is <foreign lang="greek">τόκος ἐν καλῷ</foreign> (<bibl n="Plat. Sym. 206B"><title>Symp.</title> 206 B</bibl>)&mdash;the bringing to

            or misapprehension: hence <foreign lang="greek">δόξει</foreign> (&lsquo;be supposed

            and not yet the transcendent Idea of the Beautiful, the contemplation of which demands a
            still higher flight (ib. 210 D&mdash;212 A). But Plato leaves his <foreign lang="greek">μουσικός</foreign> already knocking at the gates &lsquo;of the blest

          <p>403C - 405A Let us now discuss the subject of physical training. We may safely entrust

            ourselves with tracing outlines. Every kind of excess or self-indulgence in eating,
            drinking, and the other appetites, must be forbidden. Gymnastic must be
            &lsquo;simple&rsquo; like her sister Music. Complexity in the one case breeds
            disease, in the other vice; so that doctors and judges rise in public estimation, and

            Remains</title> II pp. <pb n="171"/> 123&mdash;126. Plato deals here chiefly with
            the hygienic aspect of gymnastic&mdash;a subject which was much discussed in his
            day: see <title>Dict. Ant.</title> I p. 929, where we are reminded that gymnasia were
            dedicated to Apollo, father of Asclepius, and himself a god of healing. In his

              Verh&auml;ltnisse zu den Hippokratischen Schriften</hi> (Landshut 1882)
            Poschenrieder has shewn that Plato was strongly influenced throughout this passage by

            the name <foreign lang="greek">Ἑλλήσποντος</foreign> in this idiomatic sense than a
            later copyist; and for this reason I have no doubt that the expression is genuine,

            the less reputable word, meaning by it the arts by which men try to lead the true
              <foreign lang="greek">δικαστής</foreign> (cf. <bibl n="Plat. Apol. 40A"><title>Ap.</title> 40 A</bibl>) astray: see infra B, C. In his own city there is no
              <foreign lang="greek">δικανική</foreign>, but only <foreign lang="greek">δικαστική</foreign> (409 E, 410 A). It appears from <title>Laws</title> IV 720 C ff.
            that a doctor's assistants were usually slaves, and that slaves for the most part
            treated slaves, and freemen freemen, but the rule was not universal (see
            Bl&uuml;mner l. c. p. 359 note 1). Plato holds that the increase of citizen doctors
            points to the spread of self-indulgence among the free-born population.</p>
          <p>405A - 410A It is a sign of bad education when we require first-rate physicians and
            judges; still more shameful is it to pride oneself on escaping the <pb n="174"/>
            punishment of wrong-doing by the aid of legal subterfuges. We should also be ashamed to
            enlarge the terminology of medicine by our self-indulgence. It was otherwise with
            medical science in the time of Homer, although Herodicus has now invented a new sort of
            treatment, whose only result is to prolong the process of dying. Asclepius knew better;
            for he saw that work was more than life. We recognise this fact in the case of artisans
            and mechanics; but Asclepius knew that rich men also have a work to do, and in the
            interests both of his patients and their country, declined to treat incurable diseases.
            Legends to the contrary effect are false. Yet we cannot dispense with doctors and
            judges: only they must be good doctors and good judges. The most skilled physicians are
            those who, besides having learnt their art, have had the largest experience of disease
            in their own persons; but no one can be a good judge whose soul is not unstained. Our
            judges must be old, and gain their knowledge of crime by science, not by personal
            experience. The vicious judge cannot recognise innocence when he sees it. Vice will
            never know Virtue, but Virtue may be taught to know Vice as well as herself. Our doctors
            will permit the physically incurable to die; the morally incurable our judges will put
            to death.</p>

            gave the wounded Eurypylus an inflammatory potion, or with Patroclus, who was curing
            him, for directing or permitting her to do so. In our Homer, however, the potion is
            given, not to Eurypylus but to the wounded Machaon, by <pb n="176"/> Hecamede, Nestor's
            slave (<title>Il.</title> XI 624); and this is correctly related in <title>Ion</title>
            538 B. The inconsistency led Ast to suspect the genuineness both of <foreign lang="greek">Εὐρυπύλῳ</foreign>&mdash;see however 408 A&mdash;and of
              <foreign lang="greek">οὐδὲ Πατρόκλῳ τῷ ἰωμένῳ</foreign>; but there can be
            little doubt that the text is sound. We must suppose either that Plato is confused, or
            else that in his text of Homer such a potion was administered, not only to the wounded
            Machaon (as in the <title>Ion</title> l.c.), but also to the wounded Eurupylus, with
            Patroclus' sanction. The first alternative is possible, and approved by Howes
              (<title>Harvard Studies</title> etc. VI p. 198): but as it is clear from the
              <title>Ion</title>&mdash; if the <title>Ion</title> is genuine&mdash;that
            Plato was familiar with the story of Machaon's treatment, I think it more likely that
            Plato's Homer related a similar incident in connexion with the treatment of Eurypylus

            to bodily weakness. This truth was not ignored by Plato (see infra 408 E and VI 496 B),
            although here, perhaps, he forgets that conspicuous examples of fortitude and

              <foreign lang="greek">σχεδόν γέ τι περὶ τοῦ σώματος</foreign> is
            assigned to Socrates. We may give either (1) the whole speech <foreign lang="greek">ναὶ

              δὴπερὶ τοῦ σώματος</foreign> to Socrates (Baiter and others, including
            Schneider 1842). The first view fails to account for the appearance of <foreign lang="greek">εἰκός γε ἔφη</foreign> in A, but is right, I think, in assigning the
            whole speech to Glauco. Neither <pb n="179"/> at <foreign lang="greek">καὶ γὰρ πρὸς
              οἰκονομίας</foreign> nor at <foreign lang="greek">τὸ δὲ δὴ μέγιστον</foreign> is
            it easy and natural to change the speakers. The simple expedient of writing <foreign lang="greek">ἔφην</foreign> for <foreign lang="greek">ἔφη</foreign> appears to me
            to set matters straight. For the corruption see <title>Introd.</title> &sect; 5.

The
            presence of <foreign lang="greek">νοσοτροφία</foreign> makes it impossible for virtue
            to be practised or tested, as when, for example, to take a pedant's illustration, a boy
            evades both lectures and examinations by cherishing a nervous headache. Recent English
            editors have followed Baiter, and read <foreign lang="greek">ὅπῃ ταύτῃ ἀρετὴ
              ἀσκεῖται καὶ δοκιμάζεται</foreign>, taking <foreign lang="greek">ταύτῃ</foreign>
            as <foreign lang="greek">ἐν φιλοσοφίᾳ</foreign>, but this gives a much less
            satisfactory meaning. After <foreign lang="greek">αὕτη</foreign> had been changed to
              <foreign lang="greek">ταύτῃ</foreign>, the rest of the corruption was easy; but a
            trace of the original reading may survive in the <foreign lang="greek">ἀρετῇ</foreign> (not <foreign lang="greek">ἀρετή</foreign>) of A.</p>

            difficulty has been raised. The word is in no sense technical, and <foreign lang="greek">ἀποκρίνω</foreign> in the sense of &lsquo;separate&rsquo; is common enough.

            the invention of medicine, and the &lsquo;healing&rsquo; reappears in a
            different form in <foreign lang="greek">φαρμάκοις τεδίαιταν</foreign>. The

            comparatively rare in Plato (Hoefer, <hi rend="italic">de part. Plat.</hi> p. 7). Partly
            on this ground, and partly because the union of the aorist <pb n="180"/>
            <foreign lang="greek">καταδεῖξαι</foreign> with <foreign lang="greek">προστάττειν</foreign> is a little awkward, I prefer the second alternative. The

            felt and led to the insertion of <foreign lang="greek">δεικνύοιεν ἄν</foreign> in

            now dispute that <foreign lang="greek">δεικνύοιεν ἄν</foreign> is a gloss. Besides
            Schneider's suggestion, which I adopt, two other proposals merit consideration: (1)
              <foreign lang="greek">δῆλοι, ἦν δ’ ἐγώ, καὶ οἱ παῖδες αὐτοῦ ὅτι τοιοῦτος
              ἦν</foreign> (Sauppe, comparing <title>Crito</title> 44 D), (2) <foreign lang="greek">δῆλον, ἦν δ’ ἐγώ, καὶ οἱ παῖδες αὐτοῦ ὅτι τοιοῦτοι. ἢ οὐχ
              ὁρᾷς κτλ.</foreign> (Madvig). The first, though regarded as possible by Schneider
              (<title>Addit.</title> p. 25), involves what is, to say the least, a very exceptional
            use of <foreign lang="greek">δῆλος</foreign>, with which &ldquo;subiectum
            sententiae verbo <foreign lang="greek">ὅτι</foreign> incipientis idem esse solet quod
            sententiae primariae&rdquo; (Hartman). Sauppe's parallel from the
            <title>Crito</title> is a doubtful exception to Hartman's rule. Moreover <foreign lang="greek">οὐχ ὁρᾷς κτλ.</foreign> is too lively: we should expect <foreign lang="greek">ἢ</foreign> (so <foreign lang="greek">Π</foreign>^{2} <foreign lang="greek">Ξ</foreign>^{2} and other MSS) <foreign lang="greek">οὐχ ὁρᾷς
            κτλ.</foreign> Madvig's correction already involves two changes (<foreign lang="greek">τοιοῦτοι</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">ἤ</foreign>), but would be improved
            by making a third, viz. <foreign lang="greek">δῆλοι</foreign> for <foreign lang="greek">δῆλον</foreign>. The minimum of dislocation which yields a satisfactory sense is the
            reading which suggested itself to Schneider, although he did not himself adopt it. Some
            may be inclined to pronounce <foreign lang="greek">ὅτι τοιοῦτος ἦν</foreign> a

            makes men in the one case hard and fierce, in the other, effeminate and mild. The

            another. Music and Gymnastic are intended to effect this harmony: and excess or
            deficiency in either of these educative instruments reflects itself in morbid and
            degenerate phases of character. He who can best blend Music with Gymnastic is the true

            strength&mdash;sensibility and courage&mdash;intellectual activity and moral
            stedfastness. It is an ideal in which the distinctive virtues of Athens and
            Sparta&mdash;of Greece and Rome&mdash;are united and transfigured. See II 375 C
            and the passages referred to there. The ideal of Pericles (<foreign lang="greek">φιλοσοφεῖν ἄνευ μαλακίας</foreign>) in many ways resembles Plato's (Thuc. II 40).

            difficulties now begin. We should expect Plato to continue: <foreign lang="greek">τὸ

            and <foreign lang="greek">τὸ φιλόσοφον</foreign>&mdash;not <foreign lang="greek">τὸ ἥμερον</foreign>&mdash;when relaxed becomes too soft, when rightly educated

            The <foreign lang="greek">θυμοειδές</foreign> is slackened (<foreign lang="greek">ἀνίεται</foreign>) by <foreign lang="greek">μουσική</foreign>, tightened or braced
              (<foreign lang="greek">ἐπιτείνεται</foreign>) by <foreign lang="greek">γυμναστική</foreign> (410 D, 411 A&mdash;E); conversely, we must suppose that the
              <foreign lang="greek">φιλόσοφον</foreign> is slackened by <foreign lang="greek">γυμναστική</foreign>, and tightened by <foreign lang="greek">μουσική</foreign>.
            Music and Gymnastic are therefore both of them necessary for each of the two strings
            (cf. IV 441 E note), although the slackening of the <foreign lang="greek">θυμοειδές</foreign> of itself also tightens the <foreign lang="greek">φιλόσοφον</foreign>, which is likewise slackened when the tension of the other is
            increased. Cf. <bibl n="Plat. Tim. 88B"><title>Tim.</title> 88 B</bibl>, C. The effect

          <p>412B - 414B So much for Education. It remains to ask &lsquo;Which of the guardians
            are to be our rulers?&rsquo; The elder shall rule the younger, and the better the
            worse. Now the best guardians are those who care most for their country and her
            interests. We shall make our selection on this principle; and we must further try those
            whom we select and see whether their patriotism is proof against all seductive
            influences. Every true opinion or belief &mdash;and the belief on which patriotism
            rests is true,&mdash;like everything else which we call good, is unwillingly
            discarded, but may be forcibly expelled by persuasion or forgetfulness, by pain,
            pleasure and the like. We shall apply these tests to prove our guardians. Those who
            emerge unscathed will become our rulers. They are the true Guardians; the others should
            be called Auxiliaries.</p>
          <p>ff. This is the first appearance of the Rulers in Plato's State, if we except the
            passing allusion in 389 C. Their presence is necessary to take the place of the original
              <foreign lang="greek">νομοθέτης</foreign> when the State has once been founded (VI
            497 D); they represent in fact the Royal or Kingly art, whose business it is to
            prescribe to others their specific good or end. See on 410 A and Nohle <hi rend="italic">die Statslehre Platos</hi> pp. 47 f., 85 ff., 113 ff. Such is their duty according to
            the later books; but here it is not so described, and the whole subject is treated in an
            exoteric way. The full and esoteric discussion of this subject is reserved for VI and
            VII. To this later treatment reference is made in 414 A and 416 B. The advocates of the
            original unity of the <title>Republic</title> justly lay stress upon the tentative and
            provisional nature of the regulations here laid down (e.g. Susemihl <title>Gen.
            Entw.</title> p. 143, Zeller^{4} II 1. p. 560 note); whereas the separatists hold that
            Plato's wider conception of the Ruling class is chronologically later than the account
            now given (Krohn <title>Pl. St.</title> pp. 28&mdash;31). An excellent defence of
            the conservative view will be found in Hirmer <title>Entst. u. Komp. d. pl. Pol.</title>

            ποιεῖν</foreign> is, to say the least, superfluous. Gaisford (with whom Cobet agrees)
            wished to expunge the entire clause as a gloss on <foreign lang="greek">δόγματος</foreign>. This solution, though drastic, may be right: for an explanation of
              <foreign lang="greek">δόγματος</foreign> is hardly needed after 412 D, E, and
              <foreign lang="greek">τοῦτο</foreign> looks like the commencement of an explanatory
            note &lsquo;this, viz. that&rsquo; etc. A simpler alternative, adopted by most
            editors, is to cancel <foreign lang="greek">αὑτοῖς ποιεῖν</foreign>, but it is
            difficult to see why a scribe should have introduced the words. The sentence, if
            genuine, seems to want the finishing touch. Cf. 407 D note</p>
          <p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">προθεμένοις ἔργα</lemma>. It is clear that Plato
            is referring to specific tests, and not (as Bosanquet seems to think) to the duties of
            war and the public service generally. So also Susemihl (<title>Gen. Entw.</title> II p.
            143), and Steinhart (<title>Einleitung</title> p. 173), the latter of whom compares, not
            very aptly, the tests of the Pythagorean brotherhood and the appalling spectacles
            displayed in the mysteries. Three kinds of tests are required: (1) <foreign lang="greek">κλοπή</foreign>, (2) <foreign lang="greek">βία</foreign>, (3) <foreign lang="greek">γοητεία</foreign>. Examples of the second kind are furnished by the severer
            discipline of gymnastic, the chase etc.: cf. <pb n="192"/>
            <title>Laws</title> 633 B ff., where the probationary value of these and similar
            exercises is appropriately insisted on by the Spartan stranger. It was fully recognised
            in the Spartan <foreign lang="greek">ἀγωγή</foreign> (Plut. <title>Lyc.</title> 17. 4
            ff.). The third order of tests may be illustrated from <title>Laws</title> 634 A, B, 635
            C, 647 D ff., 649 A, 673 E ff. <foreign lang="greek">ἡ ἐν οἴνῳ βάσανος</foreign>
            (649 D) consists in giving wine to test men's selfcontrol (<foreign lang="greek">τοῦ
              σωφρονεῖν ἕνεκα μελέτης</foreign> 673 E). Plato gives no account of the first
            variety; but a good illustration of one species of it (cf. <foreign lang="greek">τοὺς
              μεταπεισθέντας</foreign> 413 B) is provided by the speeches of self-seeking statesmen
            and unpatriotic sophists and poets. It is a curious fact that Plato's <foreign lang="greek">κλοπή</foreign> still leaves a loophole by which vicious poetry may
            creep in again. On the general question, Plato does well to insist on the educational
            value of temptation; the theory and practice of modern times recognises it in connexion
            with <foreign lang="greek">βία</foreign>, but experience too often shews that <foreign lang="greek">κλοπή</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">γοητεία</foreign> mean
            playing with fire. Cf. Grote <title>Plato</title> III p. 328.</p>

          <p>414B - 415D In order to establish all these regulations in the city, we must have
            recourse to a heroic falsehood. We shall tell the citizens that they were only dreaming
            when they believed themselves to be trained by us. In reality, they were being moulded
            and fashioned in the womb of Earth, they and all their equipments; so that it is their
            duty to defend their country like a mother, and regard their fellow-citizens as brothers
            born of Earth. We shall add that in creating some to be rulers, God mingled in their
            substance gold; silver he put in the auxiliaries; iron and copper in the farmers and
            artisans. The citizens will for the most part produce children like themselves; but
            silver offspring will sometimes come from gold, or gold from silver and the like. It is
            the first and foremost duty of the Rulers to lift and degrade children into their proper
            classes, alleging an oracle that the city shall perish when iron or copper becomes its
            guardian. It may be impossible to convince the first generation of our citizens that the
            lie is true; but their posterity may credit it.</p>
          <p>ff. After discrediting the current mythological and religious views, Plato now proceeds
            to replace them by something more in harmony with his own principles. Throughout this
            episode he is making legend in accordance with II 382 D <foreign lang="greek">διὰ τὸ
              μὴ εἰδέναι ὅπῃ τἀληθὲς ἔχει περὶ τῶν παλαιῶν, ἀφομοιοῦντες τῷ
              ἀληθεῖ τὸ ψεῦδος ὅ τι μάλιστα οὕτω χρήσιμον ποιοῦμεν</foreign>. His
            particular object is to give a religious and quasi-historical sanction to the sentiment
            of patriotism and the institution of caste. With this aim in view he frames a <foreign lang="greek">μῦθος</foreign> in which the belief of many Greek communities
            (especially the Athenians: cf. Isocr. <title>Paneg.</title> 24 f., <bibl n="Eur. Fr. 362">Eur. <title>Fr.</title> 362</bibl>) in an autochthonous ancestry is
            skilfully combined with the popular association of different metals with different
            degrees of merit, as in the Hesiodic ages of man. Cf. Hirzel <title>Der Dialog</title>
            pp. 263 f. The episode should not be understood as ironical: without it, the present
            sketch of a State would be incomplete. We require some guarantee for the permanence of
            the city and its institutions; and nothing could be more in keeping with the
            prevailingly moral and religious spirit of Plato's &lsquo;musical&rsquo;
            education than that he should find that guarantee in faith rather than in reason. The
            case is different when the Platonic city attains its full maturity, and it is equally
            appropriate that Reason, embodied in the Rulers, should then become the final guarantee.</p>

            foreign and non-Hellenic: but the words cannot be thus interpreted. The Egyptian system
            of caste (see Hdt. II 164 ff.) differed from Plato's in essential points, and there is
            no real evidence to shew that he was influenced by it in any way: nor is
            &lsquo;Phoenician&rsquo; (&lsquo;Sidonian&rsquo; in <title>Laws</title>

            copper and iron), but the older legend probably recognised four only: see Rohde
              <title>Psyche</title>^{2} I p. 87. Plato makes the golden and the other classes
            coexist&mdash;a truer and profounder view than Hesiod's. In other respects, the myth
            (as Jackson has pointed out in Susemihl and Hicks <title>Politics of Aristotle</title>
            p. 244) is not to be pressed: for &ldquo;it does not recognise the promotion of
              <foreign lang="greek">ἐπίκουροι</foreign>&rdquo; to be <foreign lang="greek">ἄρχοντες</foreign>. We should expect the <foreign lang="greek">φύλακες</foreign>
            to contain admixtures, both of gold and silver, such as are to be Rulers receiving more
            gold than silver, and conversely; but the Greek does not favour this idea. Iron again
            seems to be exclusively (though less emphatically) reserved for the farmers, and copper
            for the artisans: cf. infra B, C, VIII 547 A, B, and Arist. <title>Pol.</title> B 5.

            corner-stone of Plato's State, and as soon as it gives way, the edifice is doomed (VIII
            546 E&mdash;547 A). It is only by the elevation of the worthy and the degradation of
            the unfit that class-distinctions can be made to coincide with those of Nature (cf. IV
            423 D); and unless they do, the foundation of the city, which is <foreign lang="greek">τὸ ἑαυτοῦ πράττειν</foreign>, is sapped. Hence the emphasis with which Plato
            introduces this subject. His theory, it should be noted, conforms at least as much to
            the interest of the individual as to that of the State; for it provides congenial work
            for all according to their natural capacities, and uncongenial labour, whether above or
            below one's powers, is a fertile source of misery and crime. Aristotle
            (<title>Pol.</title> B 4. 1262^{b} 27) seems to doubt if Plato's scheme was feasible.
            Granted rulers who are <foreign lang="greek">φρόνιμοι εἰς τοῦτο, δυνατοί</foreign>,
            and <foreign lang="greek">κηδεμόνες τῆς πόλεως</foreign> (412 C), in a small

            much difficulty. See also IV 423 E ff. We are not of course to suppose that the child
            was once for all assigned to his class at birth; he would be watched and tested again
            and again, before being finally disposed of, so that the likelihood of mistakes on the

            universally believed. It would require but little effort for a Greek city like Plato's
            (V 470 E) to entertain in course of time a view which has so many points of contact with
            Greek tradition. Here Plato seems to hint that even his Rulers (for <foreign lang="greek">οἱ τούτων ὑεῖς</foreign> must include these also) will in time
            believe; the Rulers of VI&mdash;VII might teach the legend as an <foreign lang="greek">ἐν δέοντι ψεῦδος</foreign>, but would themselves refuse their assent.</p>

          <p>ff. The communism of the <title>Republic</title> is, next to its educational
            curriculum, the principal guarantee which Plato provides against the abuse of political
            power on the part of his Guardians (Nohle <hi rend="italic">die Statslehre Platos</hi>
            pp. 129 ff.). At the present stage Socrates gives only a brief and exoteric account of
            the system, reserving the full and final exposition for Book V. Plato may have been
            thinking of certain Spartan and Pythagorean institutions when he framed some of the
            regulations in this section: but his communism is much more thorough-going than anything
            of the kind before his day. See Steinhart <title>Einleitung</title> pp.

            and acute, although he ignores some essential points, and is unable throughout to rise

            reply to Aristotle, Plato might have pointed to his regulations about the interchange of
            classes (415 B ff.), which would have the effect of binding them together more securely.
            Moreover, where each individual has the work to do for which he is best qualified, one
            fruitful cause of discontent and sedition is removed. The wives and families of the
            lower class would also tend to keep them quiet. Nor does Aristotle's objection allow

            Throughout the whole of this division of the <title>Republic</title> (377
            A&mdash;392 A) Plato is laying down precepts to which the <foreign lang="greek">μῦθοι</foreign> of poets are to conform (cf. 377 B and 392 A), and in each case it
            is pointed out how the precept in question has been violated by Homer and other poets.
            Here, however, nothing is said to shew that we are prescribing for the poets, and no
            illustrations, either of our precept or of its violation, are cited from them.
            Schneider, indeed, attempts to extort this meaning from the section; but his theory,
            strictly understood, would require us to suppose that <foreign lang="greek">ἰατροῖς
              δοτέον, ἰδιώταις οὐχ ἁπτέον, προσήκει ψεύδεσθαι, οὐχ ἁπτέον τοῦ
            τοιούτου</foreign> in B, <foreign lang="greek">ψεύσασθαι, ψευδόμενον</foreign> in C,
            and <foreign lang="greek">κολάσει</foreign> in D refer not to Plato's own city, but to
            poetical representations; that <foreign lang="greek">τῆς πόλεως</foreign> in B is not
            Plato's city, but any city figuring in poetry; and that <foreign lang="greek">τοὺς
              τοιούτους ἄρχοντας</foreign> in C are not Plato's rulers, but others. Such a
            supposition is hardly possible, if <foreign lang="greek">τοιούτους</foreign> in C is
            genuine (see note ad loc.), and in any case it is neither natural nor obvious. It may
            with safety be asserted that if the section had occurred in any other context no one
            would have supposed it to contain rules for poetical fables: in itself it merely lays
            down the duty of the lower classes to speak the truth, with the conditions under which
            the rulers may lie. Cf. Rettig <title>Proleg.</title> pp. 62, 63 and notes on 389 D.
            Rettig, following up a hint of Schleiermacher's, thinks the section was introduced to
            prepare the way for the rulers' &lsquo;lie&rsquo; about the origin of the State;
            while Susemihl (<title>Genet. Entw.</title> II p. 120) in some mysterious way appears to
            connect it with the theory of Ideas &ldquo;as the true and higher Measure of the
            correct representation of Gods, Daemons, Heroes and the lower world.&rdquo; The
            latter view is altogether fanciful; and neither of these explanations justifies Plato
            for having inserted the passage in this particular connexion, where he is discussing
            poetical legend, however much Rettig may extol the &ldquo;art&rdquo; with which
            he has concealed his art. The following seems to me a more probable explanation. We are
            professedly dealing with poetical representations of the gods and heroes, and we should
            expect Plato to require the poets to represent them as truthful and to enforce his
            remarks by poetical illustrations. He does not do so, because it has <pb n="202"/>
            already been done in II 382&mdash;383. Instead of this, he reverts to 382 C
              (<foreign lang="greek">τότε ἀποτροπῆς ἕνεκα ὡς φάρμακον χρήσιμον
            γίγνεται</foreign> SC. <foreign lang="greek">τὸ ἐν τοῖς λόγοις ψεῦδος</foreign>),
            and emphasizes, more than he has hitherto done, the reason why truthfulness must be
            ascribed to the gods, viz. in order to encourage the virtue among men. That Plato laid
            the greatest stress upon the virtue of Truth appears from the fine passage in
              <title>Laws</title> 730 B, C, beginning <foreign lang="greek">Ἀλήθεια δὴ πάντων
              μὲν ἀγαθῶν θεοῖς ἡγεῖται, πάντων δὲ ἀνθρώποις</foreign>: thus it is not
            unnatural that he should recur to the subject here. The section should be taken as a
            kind of afterthought to 382&mdash;383, which it is intended partly to explain and
            partly to supplement. The whole section on Truth is for this and other reasons possibly
            later than the context in which it appears: see also on <foreign lang="greek">τοὺς
              τοιούτους ἄρχοντας</foreign>, 389 C.</p>
          <p>A further question has been raised as to what Plato intended by the virtue of <foreign lang="greek">ἀλήθεια</foreign>. Rettig (l.c. pp. 61 and 65 ff.) and Stallbaum,
            anxious to find in all this a preliminary sketch of the cardinal virtues, interpret it
            as a sort of wisdom; but in that case, why did not Plato call it by its name? He is
            content to use the names of two other cardinal virtues, <foreign lang="greek">ἀνδρεία</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">σωφροσύνη</foreign>, although they have
            not yet been defined. Nor does this account of <foreign lang="greek">ἀλήθεια</foreign>
            contain any of the distinctive features of Wisdom, either in its popular sense or in the
            sense which it bears in Book IV. There is no reason to suppose that Plato means anything
            but what he says, and he himself describes the virtue as &lsquo;speaking the
            truth.&rsquo; The whole attempt to see in this division of the dialogue a
            foreshadowing of the psychological theory of the virtues is, I believe, a mistake: only
            two of the virtues are named at all, <foreign lang="greek">ἀνδρεία</foreign> and
              <foreign lang="greek">σωφροσύνη</foreign>, and these quite without any ulterior
            meaning or motive. Plato is simply describing in a somewhat desultory way (<foreign lang="greek">ὅπῃ ἂν ὁ λόγος ὥσπερ πνεῦμα φέρῃ</foreign>)&mdash;since a
            rigid plan is not necessary here&mdash;the kind of character which Poetry should
            endeavour to foster: a character which shall honour gods and parents, set value on
            reciprocal friendship (386 A), be courageous, truthful, and distinguished for
            self-control. To force this description into the strait-jacket of the cardinal virtues
            would be pedantic. As it is, no essential feature of the <foreign lang="greek">καλὸς
              κἀγαθός</foreign> is omitted. </p>

          <head>On Plato's <foreign lang="greek">ἁρμονίαι</foreign>.</head>
          <p>III 398 E&mdash;399 B. Plato enumerates in all six scales in three groups. The
            first group is <foreign lang="greek">θρηνῶδες</foreign>, and includes Mixo-Lydian,
            Syntono-Lydian, and such like; the second is <foreign lang="greek">μαλακόν</foreign>,
            and embraces Chalaro-Ionian and Chalaro-Lydian; to the third, which occupies a middle
            position between the other two, belong Dorian and Phrygian. Chalaro-Ionian seems further
            to imply the existence of Syntono-Ionian, and we read of both in Pratinas <bibl n="Plat. Fr. 5B"><title>Fr.</title> 5 B</bibl>ergk, <foreign lang="greek">μήτε
              σύντονον δίωκε μήτε τὰν ἀνειμέναν Ἰαστὶ μοῦσαν</foreign>, &verbar;
              <foreign lang="greek">ἀλλὰ τὰν μέσαν...νεῶν ἄρουραν αἰόλιζε τῷ
            μέλει</foreign>, if Westphal's <pb n="203"/> interpretation is (as I believe) right
              (<title>Harmonik</title> p. 186. See also Monro <title>Modes of Greek Music</title>
            pp. 5, 6). It has been supposed that Plato's <foreign lang="greek">μιξολυδιστί</foreign> is only <foreign lang="greek">συντονοιαστί</foreign> under
            another name; but the name Mixo-Lydian seems rather to point to a compromise between two
            distinct modes, one of which was the Lydian. Possibly the <foreign lang="greek">συντονοιαστί</foreign> is included under <foreign lang="greek">τοιαῦταί
            τινες</foreign>, as von Jan holds <title>Fl. Jahrb.</title> 1867 p. 823.</p>
          <p>According to Westphal (l.c. pp. 215 ff.), whose theory is partly based upon what must,
            I fear, be regarded as a speculative deduction from Aristides Quintil. I pp. 21, 22 ed.
            Meibom, Plato's <foreign lang="greek">ἁρμονίαι</foreign> were as follows:&mdash;</p>
          <p>(1) Mixo-Lydian <figure/></p>
          <p>(2) Syntono-Lydian <figure/></p>
          <p>(3) Chalaro-Ionian <figure/></p>
          <p>(4) Chalaro-Lydian <figure/></p>
          <p>(5) Dorian <figure/></p>
          <p>(6) Phrygian <figure/></p>
          <p>It will be observed that Westphal's scales are all of them <foreign lang="greek">ἁρμονίαι</foreign> in the strict sense of the term, i.e. they differ in the order
            of their intervals; and that the Syntono-Lydian begins a major third higher than the
            Chalaro-Lydian.</p>
          <p>An entirely different theory has been propounded by von Jan (<title>Fl. Jahrb.</title>
            1867 pp. 815 ff.), who gives the following series of scales:&mdash;</p>
          <p>(1) Mixo-Lydian <figure/></p>
          <p>(2) Syntono-Lydian <figure/></p>
          <p>(3) Chalaro-Ionian <figure/></p>
          <p>(4) Chalaro-Lydian <figure/></p>
          <p>(5) Dorian <figure/></p>
          <p>(6) Phrygian <figure/></p>
          <p>According to this view, the Syntono-Lydian and the Chalaro-Lydian are in reality the
            same mode, differing from one another only in pitch. Plato's language appears to me to
            point to such a conclusion (see on 398 C, E), but it is not altogether easy for us to
            believe that the difference of a semitone in pitch could have converted <foreign lang="greek">τὸ θρηνῶδες</foreign> into <foreign lang="greek">τὸ
            συμποτικόν</foreign>. It will further be remarked that if we take the Dorian as the
            original and fundamental <foreign lang="greek">ἁρμονία</foreign> (<bibl n="Plat. Lach. 188D"><title>Lach.</title> 188 D</bibl>), the <foreign lang="greek">θρηνώδεις ἁρμονίαι</foreign>, according to von Jan's theory, can be made from it
            by tuning different strings a semitone higher, and the <foreign lang="greek">χαλαραί</foreign> by tuning different strings a semitone lower. <pb n="204"/></p>
          <p>Von Jan's hypothesis is severely censured by Westphal (l.c. pp. 209&mdash; 215),
            and strong arguments can be urged against it from the standpoint of modern music. I have
            quoted it in this Appendix because of its symmetry, and also because, so far as it goes,
            it seems to me to be more in harmony with the scanty indications furnished by Plato's
            language than the theory of Westphal. It is true, as Westphal urges, that Plato applies
            the term <foreign lang="greek">ἁρμονία</foreign> to Syntono-Lydian and Chalaro-Lydian
            as well as to Dorian, Phrygian etc.; but I do not think it follows that SyntonoLydian
            and Chalaro-Lydian differed in the arrangement of intervals: for <foreign lang="greek">σύντονος</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">χαλαρά</foreign> ought to refer to
            pitch alone: and <foreign lang="greek">συντονολυδιστί</foreign> or <foreign lang="greek">χαλαραλυδιστί</foreign> may have been called a <foreign lang="greek">ἁρμονία</foreign> not <hi rend="italic">qua</hi>
            <foreign lang="greek">σύντονος</foreign> or <foreign lang="greek">χαλαρά</foreign>,
            but <hi rend="italic">qua</hi>
            <foreign lang="greek">λυδιστί</foreign>. The references to Plato's <foreign lang="greek">ἁρμονίαι</foreign> in Arist. <title>Pol.</title>
            <foreign lang="greek">Θ</foreign> 5. 1340^{a} 40 ff. may be explained in the same way.
            Wherever Aristotle speaks of <foreign lang="greek">ἀνειμέναι</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">σύντονοι ἁρμονίαι</foreign>, he is referring, as the editors hold, to
            Chalaro-Lydian, Chalaro-Ionian, and Syntono-Lydian, Syntono-Ionian; and these are
            properly called <foreign lang="greek">ἁρμονίαι</foreign> as being varieties of
              <foreign lang="greek">λυδιστί</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">ἰαστί</foreign>.

            pitch of the scales&mdash;to point to a solution with which neither Westphal nor von

          <p>419A - 423B Adimantus now interposes with the objection that the Guardians will be far
            from happy. Although they are in reality masters of the city, they have nothing which
            they can call their own&mdash; none of the contributing factors of individual or
            personal gratification. In reply, it is not admitted that the Guardians will be unhappy,
            but even supposing that they are, our purpose was, not to make happy Guardians, but to
            found a happy City, in order to discover Justice within its borders. Our Guardians must
            not be made happy at the cost of efficiency in their peculiar duty. Wealth is hardly
            less unpropitious to the exercise of arts and professions than Poverty. When our city is
            at war with two communities, she will not lack resources; for she will make alliance
            with one of the two by promising to it the other's wealth. Nor will she be in danger
            from her ally afterwards. Other States are each of them not one but manifold, and our

            should rule for his own profit: cf. I 343 A, 344 B notes Socrates declines to discuss
            the question now, because it is irrelevant. In the further account of the communism of
            the ruling class, the difficulty solves itself. A higher happiness&mdash;so we are
            told&mdash; comes from self-victory than from indulgence (V 465 D ff.: cf. IX 583 C

            is an old controversy, the echoes of which have hardly yet died away. Schubart
              (<title>Fl. Jahr.</title> 1874, pp. 20 ff.) and others prefer to take <foreign lang="greek">ἀνδριάντας</foreign> merely as &lsquo;likenesses of men,&rsquo;
            but the word was regularly, if not indeed always, used of statues. That the surface of
            archaic statues was regularly painted is now no longer doubtful: see Gardner
              <title>Handbook of Greek Sculpture</title> pp. 28 ff. During the best period, in the
            case of marble or other polished surfaces, the painting was regularly confined to the
            eyes, eyelids, eyebrows, hair and the like. See on the whole subject Sittl's
              <title>Arch. der Kunst</title> (in Iwan M&uuml;ller's <title>Handbuch</title>) pp.
            413, 414. <foreign lang="greek">μέλανι</foreign> does not necessarily mean jet black,
            but only some dark and quiet colour. In point of fact, the eyes of the early marble
            statues on the Acropolis &ldquo;are painted with a dark pigment, almost
            black&rdquo; (Gardner l.c. p. 30). The use&mdash;regular in Greek&mdash;of
              <foreign lang="greek">γράφειν</foreign> for painting is an interesting survival of

            processions. The authorities are cited in M&uuml;ller <hi rend="italic">Gr.

          <p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ἐπὶ δεξιά</lemma>. Whether we read <foreign lang="greek">ἐπιδέξια</foreign> or <foreign lang="greek">ἐπὶ δεξιά</foreign> the
            word should be understood as &lsquo;from left to right.&rsquo; At a Greek
            banquet, the guests were always placed <foreign lang="greek">ἐπὶ δεξιά</foreign>,
            i.e. so that the guest on your right hand occupied a lower place <pb n="208"/> (<foreign lang="greek">ὑποκατακεκλιμένος</foreign>) than you, and the wine circulated from
            left to right of the banqueters. See Bl&uuml;mner <title>Privatalt.</title> p. 237
            note 7 and Darbishire <title>Relliq. Philol.</title> p. 78. The word suggests a banquet
            with all the formalities, and heightens the incongruity of the situation, like the
            purple robes and golden crowns of the farmers. Schneider's exhaustive discussion seems
            to me conclusive in favour of writing <foreign lang="greek">ἐπὶ δεξιά</foreign> as
            two words. Casaubon has been followed by most of the editors (except Schneider) in
            taking <foreign lang="greek">ἐπιδέξια</foreign> as an
            adverb=&lsquo;commode&rsquo; (Ast), &lsquo;commode et eleganter&rsquo;
            (Stallbaum etc.), or &lsquo;dexterously,&rsquo; &lsquo;cleverly&rsquo;
            (J. and C.); but it may well be doubted if the word could mean
            &lsquo;commode,&rsquo; and &lsquo;dexterously&rsquo; is inappropriate.
            Cf. Darbishire l.c. p. 78 note I. <foreign lang="greek">ἐπὶ δεξιά</foreign> goes with
              <foreign lang="greek">κατακλίναντες</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">πρὸς τὸ

            passage has suffered severely at the hands of critics, but the text is probably nearly,

            cannot, like ourselves, be speaking of a <foreign lang="greek">πόλις</foreign>, but of
            something else. This is logical and gives an excellent sense: cf. 422 E <foreign lang="greek">εὐδαίμων εἶ ὅτι οἴει ἄξιον εἶναι ἄλλην τινὰ

              <hi rend="italic">we</hi> are making guardians in the true sense of the term, such as
            are least likely to harm the city; whereas the author of the other proposals is making
            (not guardians, but since he gives them <foreign lang="greek">ἀγροί</foreign> 419 A) a
            sort of farmers (cf. III 417 B <foreign lang="greek">οἰκονόμοι μὲν καὶ γεωργοὶ

            think we should read <foreign lang="greek">λεωργούς</foreign> to contrast with <foreign lang="greek">ἥκιστα κακουργούς</foreign>. The word occurs in the

            observes that &ldquo;once or twice <foreign lang="greek">ἐδιδαξάμην</foreign> is

            467 E. The active <foreign lang="greek">διδάσκῃ</foreign> is appropriately used of
            teaching others (<foreign lang="greek">ά̓λλους κτλ.</foreign>); in <foreign lang="greek">διδάξεται</foreign> the personal interest reappears, for it is the sons
            who are the prominent pupils (whence <foreign lang="greek">ἢ ἄλλους</foreign> and

            result of the action rather than the action itself is partly true, but it is not the

            they say in the proverb&rsquo; or &lsquo;proverbial saying&rsquo;: see IX
            573 C, <title>Laws</title> 780 C, and cf. ib. 723 D. Now it is probable from the
            position of <foreign lang="greek">τὸ τῶν παιζόντων</foreign> that <foreign lang="greek">ἀλλ’ οὐ πόλις</foreign> forms part of the proverb: so that the whole
            saying may have run <foreign lang="greek">πόλεις μέν εἰσι παμπόλεις, ἀλλ’ οὐ
              πόλις</foreign>. (Herwerden, <hi rend="italic">more suo</hi>, cancels <foreign lang="greek">ἀλλ’ οὐ πόλις</foreign>, but we have of course no right to take this
            step.) The form <foreign lang="greek">παμπόλεις</foreign> for <foreign lang="greek">πάμπολλαι</foreign> may be allowed in a pun on <foreign lang="greek">πόλεις</foreign>, especially as the Epic plural of <foreign lang="greek">πολύς</foreign> is sometimes found with feminine nouns. It should be remarked also
            that the first hand in Paris A wrote <foreign lang="greek">πάμπολαι</foreign> (see cr.
            n.), though this may be merely accidental. What the ordinary application of the proverb
            was, we cannot say: presumably it was generally employed, as here by Plato, in speaking
            of a city divided against itself. The origin of the saying is to be sought in the
            variety of <foreign lang="greek">πεττεία</foreign> known as <foreign lang="greek">πόλεις παίζειν</foreign>, an expression which, according to the Scholiast on this
            passage of Plato, as well as Suidas s.v. <foreign lang="greek">πόλις</foreign>, and
            Hesychius s.v. <foreign lang="greek">πόλεις παίζειν</foreign>, had itself also a
            proverbial signification. In this game the abacus was divided into 60 spaces, each of
            which was called <foreign lang="greek">πόλις</foreign> in ancient times (Photius s.v.
              <foreign lang="greek">πόλεις παίζειν</foreign> ed. Porson. Porson's alteration of
              <foreign lang="greek">ξ́</foreign> i.e. 60 into <foreign lang="greek">ζ́</foreign> is
            a gratuitous change, as Schneider hints. See also Eustathius on <title>Od.</title> I p.
            29. 13 ff., ed. Lips., quoted by Schneider). The name <foreign lang="greek">πόλις</foreign> was moreover sometimes applied to the game itself (Cratinus <foreign lang="greek">Δραπετίδες</foreign>
            <title>Fr.</title> 3 ed. Meineke <foreign lang="greek">καὶ κύνα καὶ πόλιν ἣν
              παίζουσιν</foreign>), as well as to the <foreign lang="greek">πλινθίον</foreign> or
              <hi rend="italic">abacus</hi> on which it was played (Pollux IX 98). There is also, I
            think, some reason <pb n="212"/> for believing that each of the players' sides was
            called collectively his <foreign lang="greek">πόλις</foreign>. In Susemihl and Hicks
              <title>Politics of Aristotle</title> p. 148 note, Dr Jackson remarks that the words
              <foreign lang="greek">πάμπολλαι πόλεις, ἀλλ’ οὐ πόλις</foreign> make it likely
            &ldquo;that a compact body of pieces was called <foreign lang="greek">πόλις</foreign>.&rdquo; If we may go further, and suppose that the <hi rend="italic">whole</hi> of a player's side was called his <foreign lang="greek">πόλις</foreign>, the words of Plato <foreign lang="greek">δύο
              μὲνπολεμία ἀλλἡλαις, ἡ μὲν πενήτων, ἡ δὲ πλουσίων· τούτων δ’ ἐν
              ἑκατέρᾳ πάνυ πολλαί</foreign> receive additional point by becoming an exact
            counterpart of the game. A defeated player, gazing ruefully at his depopulated squares,
            each of which, as well as the whole of his side, is a &lsquo;city,&rsquo; might
            therefore well exclaim, &lsquo;Cities upon cities, but no city!&rsquo; for there
            can be no city without men (<foreign lang="greek">ἔρημος ἀνδρῶν μὴ ξυνοικούντων
              ἔσω</foreign>
            <bibl n="Soph. OT 57">Soph. <title>O. T.</title> 57</bibl>). I have thought of other
            possibilities, but this hypothesis as to the origin of the proverb suits the words of
            Plato better than any other which I can devise. For a different view see Hoffmann in
              <title>Fl. Jahrb.</title> 1863 pp. 240 ff. Cf. also Meineke <title>Fr. Com.
            Gr.</title> II pp. 44 f. It should be mentioned that Stewart (<title>Cl. Rev.</title>
            VII p. 359) thinks there need be no allusion to the game of <foreign lang="greek">πόλεις</foreign> in this passage, but only a jest about making one into many (cf.

          <p>423B - 424C Our city must not be increased beyond the limits essential to its unity. It
            will be the duty of the Guardians to see to this, as well as to assign the children to
            their proper classes in the State. These and similar duties will be easy, if our
            educational curriculum is stedfastly upheld; and it will readily appear that the
            principle of community should also be applied to matrimony and procreation. Our citizens
            will thus improve as one generation succeeds another. We must forbid all innovations in
            music and gymnastic because they are productive of political change.</p>
          <p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">μέχρι -- πέρα δὲ μή</lemma>. The extent to which

            (and the necessary farmers etc.) is therefore left to the judgment of the guardians.
            Like every natural organism, it should grow to the limits prescribed for it by nature
            (cf. 424 A note); but Plato probably conceived of it even in its maturity as relatively
            small. The regulations about marriage and the interchange between the different classes
            would be easier to work if the State was not too large. See also on <foreign lang="greek">χιλίων</foreign> in 423 A, and on the general subject Newman's

            services and functions&rsquo; between the three classes is the very foundation of
            Plato's city, which is far from being an undifferentiated unity. It is rather a <foreign lang="greek">ἓν ἐκ πολλῶν</foreign>, the <foreign lang="greek">πολλά</foreign>

          <p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">εὖ παιδευόμενοι</lemma>. Does this refer to the
            scheme of education already given, or is it a promise of the philosopher's training in
            Books VI and VII? Krohn takes the former view (<title>Pl. St.</title> p. 127), and (if
            we have regard only to the preceding discussion) it must be allowed that this is the
            natural interpretation of Plato's words. At the same time, it is not easy to see how the
            musical education of II and III would enable the guardians to grasp such a conception as
            the community of wives and children. And in the later books Plato expressly declares
            that the training necessary for the Rulers was inadequately discussed before: see VI 497
            C ff., 502 D. For these reasons we must, I think, suppose that Plato when he wrote these
            words was thinking of the education still to be provided. Cf. also III 414 A.</p>
          <p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">τήν τε τῶν γυναικῶν κτλ.</lemma> is the first
            mention of communism in wives and children. According to an ingenious chorizontic
            theory, it was this sentence which inspired the <title>Ecclesiazusae</title> of
            Aristophanes, to whose caricature Plato replies in Book V (Stein <hi rend="italic">de
              Ar. Eccles. arg.</hi> etc. and Brandt <title>Zur Entwick. d. Pl. Lehre v. d.
              Seelentheilen</title>, p. 6). See on the whole subject App. I to Book V. In <foreign lang="greek">γάμων</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">παιδοποιίας</foreign> there
            is a kind of zeugma: for <foreign lang="greek">κτῆσιν</foreign> suits only <foreign lang="greek">γυναικῶν</foreign>. Plato marks the difference by placing <foreign lang="greek">τε</foreign> after <foreign lang="greek">τήν</foreign> and not after
              <foreign lang="greek">τῶν. γάμους</foreign> (conjectured by Richards) would depend
            on <foreign lang="greek">διόψονται</foreign>; but <foreign lang="greek">διόψονται
              γάμους καὶ παιδοποιίας</foreign> is surely an impossible expression.</p>

              παροιμίαν κοινὰ τὰ φίλων εἶναι</foreign>&rdquo; (Schneider). Hartman's
            proposal to omit <foreign lang="greek">τὰ φίλων</foreign> has much in its favour. It
            is more elegant to suggest than quote so familiar a proverb; and the note <foreign lang="greek">τὰ φίλων</foreign> might well have been added by a scribe upon the
            margin. In V 449 C on the other hand the addition of <foreign lang="greek">τὰ
            φίλων</foreign> is appropriate and right.</p>
          <p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ὀρθότατα κτλ.</lemma> Adimantus accepts the
            principle, both here and in V 449 C. The doubts which he expresses later concern not the
            principle, but the <foreign lang="greek">τρόπος τῆς κοινωνίας</foreign> (ib.). It is
            obvious that the principle <foreign lang="greek">κοινὰ τὰ φίλων</foreign> might be
            applied to marriage etc. in a sentimental kind of way, without involving such a kind of
            community as is afterwards described. As Rettig points out (<title>Proleg.</title> p. 95
            note), Adimantus takes <foreign lang="greek">ὅ τι μάλιστα</foreign> as &ldquo;in
            quantum fieri posset maxime.&rdquo;</p>
          <p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ἔρχεται κτλ.</lemma>: &lsquo;goes on growing
            like a circle.&rsquo; So Schneider, rightly. Others take <foreign lang="greek">κύκλος</foreign> (1) as a hoop or wheel&mdash;&ldquo;goes on with
            accumulating force like a wheel&rdquo; (J. and C.), or (2) as an ever-widening
            circle in ruffled water (Krohn, Herwerden etc.). As to (2), <foreign lang="greek">κύκλος</foreign> cannot mean a circle in water, unless we insert <foreign lang="greek">ἐν ὕδατι</foreign>, which Herwerden has the audacity to do. If we
            adopt the first solution, we make <pb n="215"/>
            <foreign lang="greek">κύκλος</foreign> a specific kind of circle: but nothing in the
            context warrants this. It is also very doubtful if <foreign lang="greek">αὐξανομένη</foreign> can= &lsquo;with accumulating force&rsquo;: certainly
              <foreign lang="greek">κύκλος αὐξάνεται</foreign> could not bear this meaning; and
            to exclude <foreign lang="greek">αὐξανομένη</foreign> from the comparison (as J. and
            C. also suggest) renders <foreign lang="greek">ὥσπερ κύκλος</foreign> practically
            otiose. The fact is that the growth of a natural (<foreign lang="greek">κατὰ
            φύσιν</foreign>) city is just like the drawing of a circle in Plato's way of thinking.
            Like a circle it grows and expands, like a circle too, when its zenith is passed, it
            narrows to the inevitable end. Here it is only the growth which is dwelt upon; but
              <foreign lang="greek">ὥσπερ κύκλος</foreign> seems to warn us of impending decay
            and foreshadow Books VIII&mdash;IX. For more on this point see my <title>Number of
              Plato</title> pp. 58&mdash;62. <foreign lang="greek">αὐξανομένη</foreign> is
            &lsquo;growing&rsquo; in the widest sense i.e. reaching its full maturity of
            size and strength and beauty; but in what follows Plato characteristically confines
            himself to what he conceived to be a city's truest growth, the improvement of the
            citizens.</p>
          <p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">τροφὴ γὰρ κτλ.</lemma> Plato seems therefore to
            hold that acquired characters can be transmitted to posterity. The general sentiment may
            be illustrated by the quaint catches sung by choirs of old men, men in their prime, and
            boys at Sparta: (1) <foreign lang="greek">Ἁμὲς πόκ· ἦμες ἄλκιμοι

            varieties of musical composition&mdash;<foreign lang="greek">νομικός,
              διθυραμβικός, τραγικός</foreign>. They were called <foreign lang="greek">τρόποι</foreign> (according to Aristid. Quint. p. 30 Meib.) because they expressed
            different psychical characters (<foreign lang="greek">διὰ τὸ συνεμφαίνειν πως τὸ
              ἦθος κατὰ τὰ μέλη τῆς διανοίας</foreign>), because, in short, they were
              <foreign lang="greek">μιμήματα τρόπων</foreign>. Plato's <foreign lang="greek">μουσικῆς τρόποι</foreign> need not however be confined to Aristides' three
            varieties. On the connexion between musical and political changes see
            <title>Laws</title> 700 A&mdash;701 D. The connexion was recognised universally
            throughout Greece, and particularly at Sparta, where&mdash;as Pausanias (III 12. 10)
            tells us&mdash;Timotheus had his lyre confiscated for adding to it four new strings:
            cf. also Cic. <hi rend="italic">de Leg.</hi> II 39. Wherever in the ancient Greek
              <foreign lang="greek">πόλις</foreign> the conception of the individual is hardly
            separated from that of the citizen, moral and political changes are believed to go hand
            in hand; and the effect of music on morality is explained in III 400 D&mdash;401 A:
            cf. <title>Laws</title> 673 A <foreign lang="greek">τὰ μὲν τοίνυν τῆς φωνῆς μέχρι
              τῆς ψυχῆς πρὸς ἀρετῆς παιδείαν οὐκ οἶδ’ ὅντινα τρόπον ὠνομάσαμεν
              μουσικήν</foreign>. Bosanquet raises the question whether musical innovations are the
            cause or only the symptoms of political. Plato, I think, regarded them primarily as the
            cause (<title>Laws</title> ll.cc.). We can better understand their effect if we remember
            that they were accompanied by changes not only in rhythm, but also in the quality,
            ethical and otherwise, of the words sung; and if we also bear in mind the enormous
            influence of the theatre in Greek life. The latter point is emphasized in this connexion
            by Plato (ll.cc.) and Aristoxenus (ap. Ath. XIV 31). See on the whole subject Newman's

          <p>424D - 427A Our Guardians must above all things guard against changes in musical
            education. Musical innovations even if sanctioned only in play soon make themselves felt
            in every quarter of the State. The spirit of law and virtue must be infused into
            children even through their pastimes. For this reason, we should not neglect details of
            dress and manners, although they call for no special enactments, but will readily
            conform to the spirit of our rules about education. Many other individual points may
            safely be left to our guardians, if only God vouchsafes to them the preservation of our
            laws; otherwise it is in vain for them to pass law upon law, acting like those who hope
            to cure their diseases by continually changing their medicines. As nothing but a
            complete change in their habits will benefit such men, so only a revolution will cure a
            state which is similarly situated. Such cities honour and make proud the men who

          <p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ὑπορρεῖ κτλ.</lemma>: as a gentle river may become
            a destructive torrent before its course is ended. The sentence eloquently describes the
            decay of Athenian music, character, and politics from the simplicity of earlier times,
            as appears from <title>Laws</title> 700 A&mdash;701 D. See also on <foreign lang="greek">οἱ πρότερον</foreign> 425 A. For <foreign lang="greek">πολιτείας</foreign> Hartman would read the singular; but the plural is more forcible.
            Laws and constitutions are overthrown by the devouring flood. <foreign lang="greek">σύν</foreign> in Plato (as in good Attic generally) is rare; one of its recognised
            uses is in modal phrases of this kind, especially where (as here and in VI 492 B, VIII

            is to come from the guardians he has educated. One reason is that laws on matters of
            this kind can never be final: cf. <title>Laws</title> 769 D. If the guardians are true
            to the spirit of Plato's commonwealth, they will easily frame such minor regulations,
            and re-adjust them&mdash;should it prove necessary&mdash;from time to time. The
            effort to obtain finality (<foreign lang="greek">οἰόμενοι ἐπιλήψεσθαι τοῦ
              βελτίστου</foreign>) in such matters is foredoomed to failure (cf. 426 E), and no one
            makes it, until he has forgotten the real foundation of a nation's greatness, and lost
            his sense of the proportion of things. This is Plato's meaning. <pb n="220"/></p>

            duties. According to Sch&ouml;ll (in <title>Hermes</title> VI pp. 36 ff.) the

            barbarians as well as Greeks. See Middleton <title>Journ. of Hell. Studies</title> IX p.

            according to the legend, met there, having been despatched simultaneously by Zeus from
            the extreme East and West of the world (Strabo IX 3. 6). The <foreign lang="greek">ὀμφαλός</foreign> is frequently represented as the seat of Apollo (<foreign lang="greek">ἐπὶ τοῦ ὀμφαλοῦ καθήμενος</foreign>), &ldquo;especially upon

              <foreign lang="greek">ὀμφαλός</foreign>, &lsquo;navel,&rsquo; is an

            <title>Nem.</title> III 74 are to be interpreted as the cardinal virtues: see Bury ad
            loc. The nearest approach to the doctrine before Plato is in <bibl n="Xen. Mem. 3.9.1">Xen. <title>Mem.</title> III 9. 1</bibl>&mdash;5 (as Krohn has pointed out
              <title>Pl. St.</title> p. 372), with which compare IV 6. 1&mdash;12, where
            Justice, Wisdom, and Courage are named, as well as other virtues, including <foreign lang="greek">εὐσέβεια</foreign>. Cf. also <bibl n="Aesch. Seven 610">Aesch.

            passages in Plato, none of which are so precise and technical as this, it would seem
            that <foreign lang="greek">ὁσιότης</foreign> made a good fight for a fifth place:
              <bibl n="Plat. Prot. 329C"><title>Prot.</title> 329 C</bibl>, <bibl n="Plat. Lach. 199D"><title>Lach.</title> 199 D</bibl>, <bibl n="Plat. Meno 78D"><title>Men.</title> 78 D</bibl>, <bibl n="Plat. Gorg. 507B"><title>Gorg.</title>

            ἀνδρεία</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">φρόνησις</foreign> (not <foreign lang="greek">σοφία</foreign>) are named together, without <foreign lang="greek">ὁσιότης</foreign>, which in the <title>Euthyphro</title> (12 D ff.) is a
            subdivision of <foreign lang="greek">δικαιοσύνη</foreign>. From Adimantus' ready assent
            (cf. V 476 A note), we may reasonably infer that the doctrine of four cardinal virtues
            was already a familiar tenet of the Platonic school. Schleiermacher thinks it may have
            been taken over &ldquo;aus dem allgemeinen Gebrauch&rdquo;
            (<title>Einleitung</title> p. 26). There is however no evidence to shew that these four
            virtues <hi rend="italic">and no others</hi> were regarded as the essential elements of
            a perfect character before Plato. If the theory was originated by Plato himself, it is
            possible enough that in restricting the number to four, Plato was not uninfluenced by
            the sacred character of the number four in Pythagoreanism, just as Aristotle has been
            supposed to have limited his categories to ten on similar grounds. An interesting
            conjecture is <pb n="225"/> suggested by the remarks of Schleiermacher (l.c. p. 21). Our
            city is <hi rend="italic">ex hypothesi</hi> perfectly virtuous. Its constituent elements
            are Rulers, Auxiliaries, Farmers and Artisans. Now the virtues which are exhibited in
            the lives and mutual relationship of these classes are, as Plato holds, Wisdom, Courage,
            Temperance, and Justice. Consequently these virtues are the component factors of moral
            perfection; in other words they are the cardinal virtues. We may admit that there is no
              <hi rend="italic">petitio principii</hi> in such a method of investigation, which is,
            in fact, akin to the perfectly legitimate method described in <bibl n="Plat. Meno 86E"><title>Men.</title> 86 E</bibl>: cf. also V 458 A. If this suggestion is correct,
            the doctrine of four cardinal virtues will be directly descended from the arrangements
            of Plato's ideal city. But it is clear from what Plato himself says, both here and in
            429 A, 430 D, 432 B, 433 B f., that the doctrine is already an accepted part of his
            ethical system, and not merely a provisional hypothesis which is intended to be
            confirmed by what follows. For the relative value and importance of the four cardinal
            virtues in Plato's way of thinking see <title>Laws</title> 630 D ff.</p>
          <p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">οὐκοῦν -- ηὑρημένον</lemma>. Essentially the same
            method is used by Aristotle to reach his conclusion that virtue is a <foreign lang="greek">ἕξις</foreign> (<title>Eth. Nic.</title> II 4). Cf. also (with J. and
            C.) <bibl n="Plat. Lysis 216D"><title>Lys.</title> 216 D</bibl>, E. Jowett observes that
            the true function of &ldquo;this half-logical, halfmathematical method of
            residues&rdquo; is in dealing with &ldquo;abstract quantity&rdquo; and
            &ldquo;the laws of Nature.&rdquo; It is undeniable that this method is much more
            likely to lead us astray in ethics than in mathematics or the natural sciences, owing to
            the nature of the subject; but it is valid if our analysis of the phenomena is
            exhaustive and exact. A similar method was frequently employed in the Eleatic school:
            see II 380 D note Plato not unfrequently extends the methods of mathematical reasoning
            beyond what we should consider their proper sphere: the whole of the preliminary
            studies, for example, in Book VII are to be pursued according to the methods of pure
            mathematics. See on VII 528 E ff. and the Appendix to Book VII &ldquo;On the

            been written before. Secondly, if we read <foreign lang="greek">βουλευομένη</foreign>,
            we must write (with Hermann etc. and a few inferior MSS) <foreign lang="greek">ᾗ</foreign> for <foreign lang="greek">ἥ</foreign> before <foreign lang="greek">οὐχ ὑπὲρ τῶν</foreign> below. Schneider retains <foreign lang="greek">βουλευομένη</foreign>, but understands <foreign lang="greek">βουλευομένην</foreign>
            before <foreign lang="greek">ἐπιστήμην</foreign>&mdash; an indefensible
            construction, which <title>Laws</title> 807 C (to which he appeals in

          <p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">τί τὴν πόλιν προσαγορεύεις</lemma>. It should be
            noted that &lsquo;wise&rsquo; (to confine ourselves for the present to the
            virtue of wisdom) is used (1) of the rulers in the State and the <foreign lang="greek">λογιστικόν</foreign> in man, (2) of the city and the individual as wholes: cf. 441 D
            ff. Which of these two meanings is intended to be original and primary? This subject is
            admirably discussed by Hirzel <title>Hermes</title> VIII pp. 379 ff., who shews that the
            wisdom of the rulers and the <foreign lang="greek">λογιστικόν</foreign> is the
            fundamental one: cf. Arist. <title>Top.</title> V 8. 138^{b} 1 ff., where <foreign lang="greek">τὸ πρῶτον φρόνιμον</foreign> is said to be <foreign lang="greek">ἴδιον λογιστικοῦ</foreign>. The same, <hi rend="italic">mutatis mutandis</hi>,
            holds good of Courage; and also, though with a difference, of Temperance and Justice. In
            calling the whole city wise because the rulers are wise, Plato is influenced by its
            analogy with the individual man, whom we readily and easily call wise, although strictly
            speaking he is wise only by reason of the <foreign lang="greek">λογιστικόν</foreign>
            within him. Comparing 443 C ff., we observe that the city is wise because its rulers are
            wise, and its rulers are wise because their <foreign lang="greek">λογιστικόν</foreign>
            is wise. In other words the wisdom of the <foreign lang="greek">λογιστικόν</foreign> is
            the unit out of which the wisdom of the whole city is constructed. See on 443 B ff.</p>

          <p>429A - 430C The virtue of Courage will reside in the Warrior-class. It is owing to
            their bravery that we call the city brave, for the general character of the city as a
            whole cannot be determined by any courage or cowardice present among the others. The
            Soldiers will in spite of every temptation continue true to the principles laid down by
            law concerning what should, and what should not, be feared; and they will do so the more
            stedfastly, because their musical and gymnastic training has already prepared them for
            the legislation in question. It is in the <pb n="228"/> preservation of these principles
            that the courage of a city consists, a kind of courage which is distinct from the
            corresponding virtue in lower animals and slaves, because its basis is education.
            Another time we may discuss the virtue of Courage more fully, but for our present

            Hartman). In either case the <foreign lang="greek">αὐτήν</foreign> which follows has a
            different antecedent viz. <foreign lang="greek">τὴν περὶ τῶν δεινῶν
            δόξαν</foreign>, so that the sentence becomes both awkward and obscure. Moreover, in
            whichever way we understand <foreign lang="greek">αὐτήν</foreign>, the MSS leave us
            with three accusatives (<foreign lang="greek">αὐτήν, σωτηρίαν</foreign> and the
            clause introduced by <foreign lang="greek">τό</foreign>), the precise relationship of
            which is far from clear. Various suggestions have been made to escape these
            difficulties. Instead of <foreign lang="greek">αὐτήν</foreign> Jackson suggests
              <foreign lang="greek">αὖ τήν</foreign> (<title>J. Ph.</title> IV p. 148); while
            Stallbaum and others read <foreign lang="greek">τῷ</foreign> (eo quod) for <foreign lang="greek">τό</foreign>, before which Hartman for his part wishes to insert
              <foreign lang="greek">διά</foreign>. Hermann and Baiter cut the knot by expunging
            both <foreign lang="greek">αὐτήν</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">σωτηρίαν</foreign>. Jackson's remedy is the simplest, but <foreign lang="greek">αὖ</foreign> creates a difficulty. The new point in the explanation which he supposes
            it to mark is, I think, emphasized too much by <foreign lang="greek">αὖ</foreign>; nor
            indeed is it quite easy to separate <foreign lang="greek">αὖ</foreign> from <foreign lang="greek">ἔλεγον</foreign>. I believe Plato wrote <foreign lang="greek">αὐτῆς</foreign>. The words <foreign lang="greek">διὰ παντὸς αὐτῆς
            σωτηρίαν</foreign> recall and correspond exactly to <foreign lang="greek">ἣ διὰ
              παντὸς σώσει τὴν περὶ τῶν δεινῶν δόξαν</foreign>, and to 430 B <foreign lang="greek">σωτηρίαν διὰ παντὸς δόξης κτλ.</foreign>, and the meaning is
            &lsquo;by preserving it perpetually I meant preserving it throughout when one is in
            pains and in pleasures&rsquo; etc. Grammatically, the infinitives are the direct
            object of <foreign lang="greek">ἔλεγον</foreign> (&lsquo;I called&rsquo;), and
              <foreign lang="greek">διὰ παντὸς αὐτῆς σωτηρίαν</foreign> is its secondary
            object. The presence of <foreign lang="greek">αὐτῆς σωτηρίαν</foreign>
            <pb n="229"/> is necessary to correspond to <foreign lang="greek">διασῴζεσθαι
            αὐτήν</foreign>, but <foreign lang="greek">διὰ παντὸς</foreign> takes the first
            place, because it is the phrase requiring elucidation. The corruption of <foreign lang="greek">αὐτῆς</foreign> to <foreign lang="greek">αὐτήν</foreign> is of a
            piece with that of <foreign lang="greek">γεγονυίας</foreign> to <foreign lang="greek">γεγονυῖαν</foreign> (see cr. n.) and its all but inevitable consequence. The

            Herwerden cuts out <foreign lang="greek">ὥστ’ εἶναι</foreign>, but without these
            words the wool which we are dyeing would be purple, whereas it is white, and we are

          <p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">πρῶτον μὲν κτλ.</lemma> As far as concerns the
            language and grammatical construction of this passage it is clear that the object of
              <foreign lang="greek">ἐκλέγονται</foreign> should be the same as that of <foreign lang="greek">προπαρασκευάζουσιν, θεραπεύσαντες</foreign>, and <foreign lang="greek">βάπτουσι</foreign>, and identical with the subject of <foreign lang="greek">δέζεται</foreign>. Now the object of <foreign lang="greek">βάπτουσι</foreign> is the
            wool selected to be dyed; it is therefore the wool which is subjected to <foreign lang="greek">προπαρασκευή</foreign>, and consequently white substances of wool are
            meant by <foreign lang="greek">μίαν φύσιν τὴν τῶν λευκῶν</foreign> (so also
            Bl&uuml;mner <title>Technologie</title> etc. I pp. 221 ff.). That this
            interpretation is right, appears also from the application of the simile. The guardians
            are the white woollen substances specially selected (note <foreign lang="greek">ἐξελεγόμεθα</foreign> 429 E), their education is the <foreign lang="greek">προπαρασκευή</foreign>; and the <foreign lang="greek">δόξα περὶ δεινῶν
            κτλ.</foreign> is the dye. This is expressly pointed out in 429 E&mdash;430 A.
              <foreign lang="greek">τοσούτων</foreign> is strictly in point, for woollen substances
            may be of any colour, since they may have been already dyed. Plato informs us that dyers
            selected white woollen substances when they wished to impart a lasting purple hue. Cf.
              <bibl n="Plat. Tim. 50D"><title>Tim.</title> 50 D</bibl>, E. The <foreign lang="greek">προπαρασκευή</foreign> included the process called <foreign lang="greek">στύψις</foreign>, i.e. steeping the wool in an astringent solution (<foreign lang="greek">πρόστυμμα</foreign>) to make it take the dye better (Arist. <hi rend="italic">de Col.</hi> 4. 794^{a} 29 and <title>Probl.</title> XXII 11. 931^{a} 13

            else that <foreign lang="greek">θεραπεύσαντες</foreign> is used for <foreign lang="greek">θεραπεύοντες</foreign>. The first alternative is inadmissible: for
              <foreign lang="greek">προθεραπεύσας</foreign> in E shews that the <foreign lang="greek">θεραπεία</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">προπαρασκευή</foreign> are
            identical. As for the second, Schneider remarks &ldquo;aoristum ipsum pro praesenti
            positum vix credo.&rdquo; There are some instances in which &ldquo;an aorist
            participle denoting that in which the action of a verb of <hi rend="italic">past</hi>
            time consists may express time coincident with that of the verb, when the actions of the

            52: cf. K&uuml;hner <title>Gr. Gr.</title> II pp. 161 ff.), but as <foreign lang="greek">προπαρασκευάζουσιν</foreign> is a verb of present or universal time,
            Goodwin's rule is inapplicable here. Hartman ejects the participle, and Schneider is
            anxious to read <foreign lang="greek">θεραπεύοντες</foreign>. In my edition of the

            <foreign lang="greek"> χαλεστραῖον λίτρον</foreign> (or <foreign lang="greek">νίτρον</foreign>, but <foreign lang="greek">λίτρον</foreign> is the Attic form) came
            from <foreign lang="greek">Χαλέστρα</foreign>, a lake and city in Macedonia. <foreign lang="greek">λίτρον</foreign> is supposed to be &lsquo;native carbonate of
            soda&rsquo;: see Blaydes on <bibl n="Aristoph. Frogs 712">Ar. <title>Frogs</title>
            712</bibl>. The spelling <foreign lang="greek">χαλεστραῖον</foreign> is established (as
            against <foreign lang="greek">χαλαστραῖον</foreign> in Tim. <title>Lex.</title> s. v.
            and the Scholiast) by Hdt. VII 123 (<foreign lang="greek">χαλέστρα</foreign>) and other
            authorities quoted by Schneider. <foreign lang="greek">κονία</foreign> as appears from
              <foreign lang="greek">ψευδολίτρου κονίας</foreign> in Ar. l. c. was a preparation of
              <foreign lang="greek">λίτρον</foreign>, whence Plato couples them here. See on the

        <div type="section" n="430B">
          <p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">παντὸς ἄλλου ῥύμματος</lemma> is cancelled by
            Badham and others. It is difficult however not to feel that something is wanted to
            balance <foreign lang="greek">χαλεστραίου</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">κονίας</foreign>, especially as these are two specific detergents of the same class.
            Further, without <foreign lang="greek">παντὸς ἄλλου ῥύμματος</foreign> Plato would
            probably have written <foreign lang="greek">καὶ λύπη κτλ.</foreign> The sentence as it
            stands rings Platonic; nor was <foreign lang="greek">παντὸς ἄλλου
            ῥύμματος</foreign> at all likely to be added by a scribe. The words were also in the
            text <pb n="231"/> used by Stobaeus and Theo Smyrnaeus: see <title>Flor.</title> 43. 97
            and <hi rend="italic">de utilit. math.</hi> p. 14. I suggest the following
            interpretation. The action of pleasure differs from that of pain, fear, and desire, in
            being more gentle, and less violent (<foreign lang="greek">βίαιος</foreign>). Pleasure
            in short relaxes (<foreign lang="greek">χαλᾷ</foreign>) while pain (of which fear and
            desire as such are both varieties) contracts: cf. III 411 A on the effect of <foreign lang="greek">γλυκεῖαι ἁρμονίαι</foreign>, <bibl n="Plat. Tim. 66C"><title>Tim.</title> 66 C</bibl> and Stallbaum on <bibl n="Plat. Phileb. 46D"><title>Phil.</title> 46 D</bibl>. Now <foreign lang="greek">χαλεστραίου</foreign>
            suggests <foreign lang="greek">χαλᾶν</foreign>, and it is probably for this reason that
            Plato compares pleasure to it. Such a play on words is quite in Plato's manner: cf.
              <bibl n="Plat. Prot. 361D"><title>Prot.</title> 361 D</bibl>. If we suppose that other
              <foreign lang="greek">ῥύμματα</foreign> were harder, and less agreeable in their
            action, the point of comparing pain etc. with &lsquo;every other
            detergent&rsquo; will appear.</p>
          <p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">τὴν ὀρθὴν δόξαν</lemma> has been questioned, on
            the ground that beasts cannot have <foreign lang="greek">ὀρθὴ δόξα</foreign>. It was
            no doubt a feeling of this kind which gave birth to the reading <foreign lang="greek">αὐτήν</foreign> for <foreign lang="greek">ὀρθήν</foreign> in some inferior MSS.
            Herwerden employs his favourite remedy of excision; and other equally unsatisfactory
            remedies will be found in Hartman. The text is quite sound. True opinion is in Plato the
            basis of action done in ignorance of what is right but in obedience to an authority
            which knows. A dog and a slave act from true opinion as often as they obey a master who
            orders them to do what is right. So also (among others) Rettig (<title>Proleg.</title>
            p. 109) and Krohn (<title>Pl. St.</title> p. 42) rightly understand the passage. Cf.
            note on <foreign lang="greek">πολιτικήν</foreign> in C below.</p>
          <p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">οὔτε -- τε</lemma>=&lsquo;not only
            not&mdash;but also&rsquo; lays stress on the second clause: cf. 427 C, VIII 566
            D, E, IX 587 A al.</p>
          <p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">μόνιμον</lemma>. See cr. n. The reading of some of
            Stobaeus' MSS (<title>Flor.</title> 43. 97) (which Dobree and others approved) appears
            to me almost certainly right, although it has been adopted by no recent editor. <foreign lang="greek">νόμιμον</foreign>, as Rettig shews (<title>Proleg.</title> p. 110), must
            be used in precisely the same sense as in <foreign lang="greek">δόξης ὀρθῆς τε καὶ
              νομίμου</foreign> just before. If so, Plato flatly (except for the <foreign lang="greek">οὔτε πάνυ</foreign>) contradicts himself. For the only reason why a
              <foreign lang="greek">δόξα</foreign> is <foreign lang="greek">ὀρθή</foreign> is
            that it is <foreign lang="greek">νόμιμος</foreign> &lsquo;in accordance with the
            law&rsquo;: nor is it possible for even a dog to possess an <foreign lang="greek">ὀρθὴ δόξα</foreign> which is not <foreign lang="greek">νόμιμος</foreign>. In
            obeying a just command, the <foreign lang="greek">δόξα</foreign> of a dog is therefore
            not <foreign lang="greek">οὐ πάνυ νόμιμος</foreign>, but wholly <foreign lang="greek">νόμιμος</foreign>. On the other hand <foreign lang="greek">μόνιμον</foreign> is not
            only appropriate but necessary in what is practically a r&eacute;sum&eacute; of
            Socrates' whole account of courage (<foreign lang="greek">δοκεῖς γάρ μοι
              καλεῖν</foreign>). The only difference between the <foreign lang="greek">ὀρθὴ δόξα</foreign> of a guardian and a dog lies in this, that the former has
            received <foreign lang="greek">παιδεία</foreign>, while the latter has not. And it is
            precisely this difference which makes the guardian's <foreign lang="greek">δόξα</foreign> lasting, as the whole of the simile from dyeing was intended to shew
              (<foreign lang="greek">ἵνα δευσοποιὸς κτλ.</foreign> 430 A). Finally, the soldier's
              <foreign lang="greek">ὀρθὴ δόξα</foreign> has just been defined (in 430 B) as
              <foreign lang="greek">σωτηρίαν διὰ παντός κτλ.</foreign> To <foreign lang="greek">διὰ παντός</foreign> the words <foreign lang="greek">οὐ πάνυ μόνιμον</foreign>
            are the necessary contrast: the <foreign lang="greek">δόξα</foreign> is in both cases
              <foreign lang="greek">ὀρθή τε καὶ νόμιμος</foreign>, only you can depend on the
            guardian always, <foreign lang="greek">ἔν τε λύπαις καὶ ἐν ἡδοναῖς καὶ ἐν
              ἐπιθυμίαις καὶ ἐν φόβοις</foreign> (429 D), but not always on your dog and slave.

            is because they are destitute of knowledge that courage is denied to the lower animals.

        <div type="section" n="430C">
          <p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">πολιτικήν γε -- δίιμεν</lemma>. In this passage
              <foreign lang="greek">πολιτικὴν ἀνδρείαν</foreign> means, I think, primarily the
            virtue of a <foreign lang="greek">πόλις</foreign> as opposed to that of an <foreign lang="greek">ἰδιώτης</foreign>: cf. 442 D <pb n="232"/>
            <foreign lang="greek">πόλεώς τε καὶ ἰδιώτου</foreign>. Our <foreign lang="greek">πόλις</foreign> is brave because her soldiers are brave (429 B); so that in
            describing the courage of the soldiers we have really and truly been describing that of
            our city. But the <foreign lang="greek">ἀνδρεία</foreign> with which we are now
            concerned is <foreign lang="greek">πολιτική</foreign> in another, and more important
            sense, being based on &lsquo;correct opinion&rsquo; (cf. <bibl n="Plat. Phaedo 82A"><title>Phaed.</title> 82 A</bibl>, B), i.e. in this instance on
            opinion which is in conformity with the law of the <foreign lang="greek">πόλις</foreign> (cf. Aristotle's <foreign lang="greek">πολιτικὴ ἀνδρεία</foreign>
            <title>Eth. Nic.</title> III 11. 1116^{a} 16 ff.), and not on
            &lsquo;knowledge,&rsquo; like the scientific or philosophic virtue to which we
            are introduced in Books VI and VII. In this Platonic connotation of the term, <foreign lang="greek">δημοτική</foreign> or <foreign lang="greek">πολιτικὴ
            ἀνδρεία</foreign> is inferior both to the courage which rests upon knowledge in the
            Socratic sense (<bibl n="Plat. Lach. 195A"><title>Lach.</title> 195 A</bibl>, 196 E ff.,
              <bibl n="Plat. Prot. 349D"><title>Prot.</title> 349 D</bibl> ff.) and to that which
            rests on knowledge of the Idea of the Good (cf. VI 506 A), although it is nevertheless
            on a much higher plane than the so-called courage of slaves and brute beasts, because it
            is <foreign lang="greek">μετὰ παιδείας γεγονυῖα</foreign>. In <foreign lang="greek">αὖθισδίιμεν</foreign> Siebeck (<title>Zur Chron. d. Pl. Dial.</title>
            pp. 126 ff.) finds a promise of the <title>Laches.</title> To this view it seems to me a
            serious objection that the <title>Laches</title> has nothing to say of the
            characteristically Platonic distinction between <foreign lang="greek">ἐπιστήμη</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">ὀρθὴ δόξα</foreign>: for that very
            reason it is probably earlier than this passage. Courage in the <title>Laches</title> is
            little more than Socratic courage (cf. <title>Mem.</title> IV 6. 10 ff.), for the
            knowledge of the good into which it is finally resolved is not knowledge of the Idea.
            Others have found in <foreign lang="greek">αὖθις</foreign> a reference to the account
            of Courage in the individual (442 B), or to V 467 A ff., or to VI 486 B. None of these
            references are in point; and it is simplest to take Plato at his word. He drops the
            subject because further discussion of it would be irrelevant; he will resume it on
            another occasion if Adimantus wishes, but Adimantus is content. Cf. VII 532 D note and
            see also on 1 347 E. The whole of this section of the dialogue is important because it
            emphatically reaffirms the principle that courage as well as the other virtues
            enumerated here rests on <foreign lang="greek">ὀρθὴ δόξα</foreign> and not on
              <foreign lang="greek">ἐπιστήμη</foreign>. We have already seen that Plato's earlier
            scheme of education aims at implanting only <foreign lang="greek">ὀρθὴ
            δόξα</foreign>. Cf. II 376 E note</p>

              <foreign lang="greek">ζητοῦμεν</foreign> (found also in one or two MSS) is
            unnecessary.</p>

          <p>430D - 432A Thirdly, we consider Temperance. This virtue resembles a kind of
            &lsquo;harmony&rsquo; or mutual accord. It is often explained as self-control.
            Self-control means that the better self rules the worse; and this is surely true of our
            city, for in it the higher controls the lower, and the irrational desires of the
            inferior many are subject to the rational desires of the virtuous few. Further, our
            citizens are in accord with one another as to who shall rule and who shall be ruled, so
            that Temperance is present in both ruled and rulers, pervading the whole city through
            and through and rendering it accordant with itself. We may define Temperance as accord
            between the naturally better and the naturally worse, on the question which of them
            should rule.</p>
          <p>ff. The difficulties connected with Plato's view of Temperance and Justice and their
            mutual relationship have been to a large extent cleared up by Hirzel
            (<title>Hermes</title> VIII pp. 379&mdash;411). Hirzel's conclusions, some of which
            have been attacked by W. A. Hammond in his instructive dissertation &ldquo;On the
            notion of Virtue in the Dialogues of Plato,&rdquo; but not, I think, successfully,
            are now accepted in the main by Zeller^{4} II 1, pp. 884 ff. Till Hirzel wrote, the
            tendency was to regard the two virtues as nearly, if not quite, identical&mdash;in
            which case one of the two would be practically superfluous. In that case, Plato's search
            for Justice is little better than a fiasco, and <pb n="233"/> his ideal city falls to
            pieces. Cf. Rettig <title>Proleg.</title> p. 137. Hirzel succeeds in shewing that
            Justice and Temperance are different, and both of them necessary to Plato's perfect
            city; nor does he employ any other method than a strict interpretation of Plato's own
            words as they occur. See on 432 A.</p>
          <p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">πρότερον</lemma> is omitted by Richards as
            illogical. So slight a flaw is easy to forgive; and <foreign lang="greek">ἔτι</foreign> in <foreign lang="greek">μηκέτι</foreign> suggests that <foreign lang="greek">πρότερον</foreign> is genuine. Nor could Adimantus well have said that
            in any event he did not wish Justice&mdash;<foreign lang="greek">οὗ δὴ ἕνεκα
              πάντα ζητοῦμεν</foreign>&mdash;to be discovered.</p>

            sounding to the ear as absolute unison; hence the point of <foreign lang="greek">ταὐτόν</foreign>, which is an accusative depending directly on <foreign lang="greek">ξυνᾴδοντας</foreign>. See Arist. l.c. 14. 918^{b} 7 ff. <foreign lang="greek">διὰ τί λανθάνει τὸ διὰ πασῶν καὶ δοκεῖ ὁμόφωνον εἶναι, οἷον
              ἐν τῷ φοινικίῳ καὶ ἐν τῷ ἀνθρώπῳ;</foreign> The whole expression <foreign lang="greek">διὰ πασῶν ξυνᾴδοντας ταὐτόν</foreign> therefore means that the
            concord of the citizens on the matter in question is absolute and complete. Further than
            this I do not think the comparison is to be pressed. If we seek to find analogies
            between <foreign lang="greek">ἀσθενεστάτους, ἰσχυροτάτους, μέσους</foreign> and the
              <foreign lang="greek">ὑπάτη, νήτη</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">μέση</foreign> of the scale, we are met by the difficulty that the <foreign lang="greek">μέση</foreign> cannot be said to produce the same (<foreign lang="greek">ταὐτόν</foreign>) note as the <foreign lang="greek">ὑπάτη</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">νήτη</foreign>, and we are not at liberty <pb n="236"/> to suppose that
            Plato is thinking of <foreign lang="greek">ἡ δὶς διὰ πασῶν</foreign> in the face of
            his own words, which refer only to a single octave (<foreign lang="greek">διὰ πασῶν
              παρεχομ νη κτλ.</foreign>). In talking of <foreign lang="greek">σωφροσύνη</foreign>
            Plato usually distinguishes only between two classes&mdash;rulers and ruled: 431 D,
            E and infra <foreign lang="greek">χείρονός τε καὶ ἀμείνονος</foreign>. See also on

            equipoise and measured cadence of this stately sentence may well suggest a chorus of
            voices singing in unison. Cf. III 401 C. Cobet's excision of the second <foreign lang="greek">βούλει</foreign> is sadly out of tune.</p>
          <p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ταύτην τὴν ὁμόνοιαν</lemma> prepares us for the
            definition about to follow. There are various <foreign lang="greek">ὁμόνοιαι</foreign>: this one is agreement <foreign lang="greek">ὁπότερον δεῖ
              ἄρχειν</foreign> etc.</p>
          <p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">χείρονος κτλ.</lemma>: &lsquo;concord between
            the naturally better and the naturally worse, on the question which should rule, whether
            in a city or in an individual.&rsquo; <foreign lang="greek">ἐν ἑνὶ
            ἑκάστῳ</foreign> anticipates 442 C f.; but is justified here by 431 A, B.</p>
          <p>We may now sum up Plato's account of <foreign lang="greek">σωφροσύνη</foreign> so far
            as it is a virtue of the State. It involves three elements: (1) the rule of the better
            over the worse, (2) the rule of <foreign lang="greek">φρόνησις</foreign> over the
            desires, (3) the agreement of better and worse as to which shall rule. (1) and (2) are
            different ways of expressing the same thing; neither is fundamental, for (granted the
            presence of <foreign lang="greek">σοφία</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">ἀνδρεία</foreign>) both of them follow from (3), whereas (3) does not follow from
            either. Plato accordingly admits (3) only into his final definition. It follows from (3)
            that <foreign lang="greek">σωφροσύνη</foreign>, unlike <foreign lang="greek">σοφία</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">ἀνδρεία</foreign>, is a virtue possessed
            by all the three classes of the City. Krohn (<title>Pl. St.</title> p. 372) pronounces
              <foreign lang="greek">σωφροσύνη</foreign> otiose and
            &ldquo;ornamental.&rdquo; The charge is best refuted by considering whether the
            City is complete without it. (The part played by Justice will be discussed later.) Apart
            from <foreign lang="greek">σωφροσύνη</foreign>, what virtue remains for the third class
            of citizens? and what guarantee is there that <foreign lang="greek">σοφία</foreign>
            will consent to rule? (see on <foreign lang="greek">ἐν ἀμφοτέροις</foreign> 431 E).
            Whereas <foreign lang="greek">σωφροσύνη</foreign> not only provides for the third
            class, but furnishes a point of union in which all the classes may meet, and the City,
            so far, become <foreign lang="greek">μία ἐκ πολλῶν</foreign> (cf. 443 E). If we bear
            in mind that the Rulers are only select Guardians, and that <foreign lang="greek">φύλακες</foreign> includes both Rulers and Auxiliaries, we may tabulate the virtues
            of the three classes thus:&mdash;</p>
          <p>Virtues of Rulers, <foreign lang="greek">σοφία</foreign> + <foreign lang="greek">ἀνδρεία</foreign> + <foreign lang="greek">σωφροσύνη</foreign>.</p>
          <p>Virtues of Soldiers, <foreign lang="greek">ἀνδρεία</foreign> + <foreign lang="greek">σωφροσύνη</foreign>.</p>
          <p>Virtues of Farmers, etc., <foreign lang="greek">σωφροσύνη</foreign>.</p>
          <p>Hirzel is, I think, mistaken in holding that <foreign lang="greek">σωφροσύνη</foreign>
            is a virtue of the whole and not of the parts; the fact is that it is a virtue both of
            the whole and of each of the parts. Strictly speaking, of course, <foreign lang="greek">ὁμόνοια</foreign> or <foreign lang="greek">ξυμφωνία</foreign> implies more parts
            than one, and <hi rend="italic">con</hi>cord is impossible to a unit; but the essence of
            the virtue consists in the view that the best shall rule, and this view is present in
            each of the three classes. For <foreign lang="greek">δικαιοσύνη</foreign> see 434 C
            note</p>
          <p>Plato's account of <foreign lang="greek">σωφροσύνη</foreign> in other dialogues
            differs in many respects from this, and is rather a hindrance than a help in elucidating
            the present passage. Cf. Hirzel l.c. p. 409. The <foreign lang="greek">σωφροσύνη</foreign> of the <title>Charmides</title> is fully discussed by Knuth

          <p>432B - 434C Where then is Justice? We must beware lest she escape us. Socrates
            presently exclaims that he has found the trail. Justice is the principle, or else one
            form of the principle, which we laid down at the beginning, viz. that each individual
            shall fulfil that function only for which he is naturally best fitted. In other words,
              <pb n="237"/> Justice is, in a certain sense, &lsquo;minding one's own
            business.&rsquo; Four considerations point to this conclusion. In the first place,
            it is in order to make the other three take root that we require a fourth virtue; and it
            is just the division of duty according to natural capacity which renders the other three
            virtues possible. Secondly, this is the only principle which can be compared with the
            other three virtues in respect of benefit conferred upon the State: and Justice must be
            comparable with them in this respect. Thirdly, it is by this principle that the Rulers
            will direct their judicial decisions, and Justice is the principle by which our Rulers
            judge. Lastly, the violation of this principle works the greatest mischief in the City.
            So does Injustice; so that the principle itself is identical with Justice.</p>

            <foreign lang="greek">τοι</foreign> etc. p. 35). Plato first states a popular view, and
            then proceeds to shew that it is mainly right on grounds presently to be stated (whence
              <foreign lang="greek">οἷσθ’ ὅθεν τεκμαίρομαι;</foreign>). <pb n="239"/> No stress
            should be laid on the fact that <foreign lang="greek">δικαιοσύνη</foreign> is in one
            case the predicate, and in the other the subject: complete identity is predicated in
            both cases, as the abstract <foreign lang="greek">δικαιοσύνη</foreign> shews. It might
            be different if we read <foreign lang="greek">δίκαιον</foreign>, but for this there is
            no occasion. There is still however a difficulty in <foreign lang="greek">δικαιοσύνη</foreign>: see next note.</p>

        <div type="section" n="433B">
          <p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">εἰρήκαμεν γάρ</lemma>. This has not been said in
            the <title>Republic</title>, nor (so far as I know) in any of Plato's earlier dialogues
            (if we except <title>Alc.</title> I 127 C), so that <foreign lang="greek">εἰρήκαμεν</foreign> refers to ordinary conversation. Such a view has affinities with
            the legal view of Justice as the virtue which respects the rights of others (cf. 433 E
            and I 331 A ff.), and is natural enough, especially with the loose connotation which
              <foreign lang="greek">δικαιοσύνη</foreign> had in popular language. It is however
            curious that in <bibl n="Plat. Charm. 161B"><title>Charm.</title> 161 B</bibl> ff.
            precisely the same account is given of Temperance: <foreign lang="greek">ἄρτι γὰρ
              ἀνεμνήσθην ὂ ἤδη του ἤκουσα λέγοντος, ὅτι σωφροσύνη ἂν εἴη τὸ τὰ
              ἑαυτοῦ πράττειν</foreign>: cf. <bibl n="Plat. Tim. 72A"><title>Tim.</title> 72 A</bibl>
            <foreign lang="greek">εὖ καὶ πάλαι λέγεται τὸ πράττειν καὶ γνῶναι τά τε
              αὑτοῦ καὶ ἑαυτὸν σώφρονι μόνῳ προσήκειν</foreign>. In its popular
            connotation, <foreign lang="greek">σωφροσύνη</foreign> was not always distinguished
            from <foreign lang="greek">δικαιοσύνη</foreign>, and even the philosophers (as Strabo
            VII 3. 4 observes) sometimes used the words in nearly an identical sense. See
            N&auml;gelsbach <title>Nachhom. Theol.</title> p. 238. Steinhart and others find in
            the difference between this passage and the <title>Charmides</title> l.c. an indication
            of the Socratic and Platonic doctrine of the unity of Virtue. No doubt there is a
            certain sense in which virtue is one (see below on 434 C), but we must insist that the
            specific virtues are represented by Plato in the <title>Republic</title> as distinct; on
            any other hypothesis, the perfect City falls to pieces. Perhaps <foreign lang="greek">δικαιοσύνη</foreign> after <foreign lang="greek">πολυπραγμονεῖν</foreign> is an
            error for <foreign lang="greek">σωφροσύνη</foreign>, and Plato is here deliberately <hi rend="italic">correcting</hi> the popular view. If so, <foreign lang="greek">καὶ
              μὴνγε</foreign> means &lsquo;and yet,&rsquo; i.e. in spite of what
            we now say that <title>Justice</title> is <foreign lang="greek">εἷς ἓν κατὰ
            φύσιν</foreign>, &lsquo;we and others have also said that <title>Temperance</title>
            is <foreign lang="greek">τὰ αὑτοῦ πράττειν</foreign>.&rsquo; Adimantus assents.
            &lsquo;Well,&rsquo; continues Socrates, &lsquo;it is apparently (not
            Temperance, but) <title>Justice</title> which is <foreign lang="greek">τὰ αὑτοῦ
              πράττειν</foreign>.&rsquo; This view gives a much better sense to <foreign lang="greek">καί</foreign> in <foreign lang="greek">καὶ τοῦτο</foreign>, and
              <foreign lang="greek">ἡ δικαιοσύνη</foreign> receives the proper emphasis.</p>
          <p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">δοκεῖ -- εὕροιμεν</lemma>. Things which are equal

            Therefore Justice enables the other Virtues to take root. &lt;But that which does so
            is <foreign lang="greek">τὰ αὑτοῦ πράττειν</foreign>. Consequently Justice is

            Ast) retain <foreign lang="greek">παρέχειν</foreign> and explain it as depending
            directly on <foreign lang="greek">δοκεῖ</foreign>. If this is right, <foreign lang="greek">καί</foreign> before <foreign lang="greek">ἐγγενομένοις</foreign>
            joins <foreign lang="greek">τοῦτο εἶναι</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">παρέχειν</foreign>; but <foreign lang="greek">καὶ ἐγγενομένοις γε</foreign>,
            following immediately on <foreign lang="greek">ἐγγενέσθαι</foreign>, naturally
            suggests that <foreign lang="greek">παρέχειν</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">ἐγγενέσθαι</foreign> are coordinate and both under the government of <foreign lang="greek">ὥστε</foreign>. That this was felt in antiquity is proved by the
            variant <foreign lang="greek">ἐγγενόμενα</foreign> for <foreign lang="greek">ἐγγενομένοις</foreign>, preserved in Stobaeus (<title>Flor.</title> 43. 98) and in
              <foreign lang="greek">Ξ</foreign>. The author of the reading <foreign lang="greek">ἐγγενόμενα</foreign> must have understood Plato to mean &lsquo;which enabled
            them all to make their appearance in the city, and having done so, to keep it safe, so
            long as they are there,&rsquo; and this, I think, is the natural meaning of Plato's
            words, if <foreign lang="greek">παρέχειν</foreign> is retained. But the sentiment is
              compara<pb n="240"/> tively weak; and consequently Ast and Hartman wish to cancel
              <foreign lang="greek">παρέχειν</foreign>, making <foreign lang="greek">σωτηρίαν</foreign> depend upon <foreign lang="greek">παρέσχεν</foreign>; but a
            present tense is necessary. <foreign lang="greek">παρέχει</foreign> seems to me what
            Plato wrote, &lsquo;aye, and after they have appeared it preserves them, so long as
            it is present in the city.&rsquo; A relative clause often passes into an independent
            sentence (see on II 357 B); and the idiom is appropriate here because it responds to the
            emphatic <foreign lang="greek">καὶγέ</foreign>. For <foreign lang="greek">καὶγε</foreign> cf. 425 B note</p>

            <foreign lang="greek"> ἑαυτοῦ</foreign> is a possessive genitive depending on <foreign lang="greek">τοῦ</foreign>. It should be noted that although <foreign lang="greek">ἕξις τοῦ οἰκείου</foreign> is not the same thing as <foreign lang="greek">πρᾶξις τοῦ οἰκείου</foreign>, the latter involves the former. Plato is looking
            for a point of contact between his own view of Justice and the popular judicial meaning
            of the word, and finds it in <foreign lang="greek">ἕξις τοῦ οἰκείου</foreign>.
            Krohn (<title>Pl. St.</title> p. 49) appears to me to attach too much weight to <foreign lang="greek">ἕξις τοῦ οἰκείου</foreign> when he calls it a new
            &ldquo;Begriffselement,&rdquo; and complains that it is &ldquo;weder

            Madvig's conjecture <foreign lang="greek">ταῦτα</foreign> is improbable, though adopted
            by Baiter. Adimantus would catch the meaning all the more easily on account of the

            transcendental or metaphysical about it, as Krohn rightly observes (<title>Pl.

              &lt;&gt;ν κατὰ φύσιν</foreign> applied to the three component units or
            factors of the State. Cf. II 370 A note It is moreover the soil out of which all the
            other virtues grow; its fruits are Wisdom, Courage, Temperance, of which the last
            appears in the Farmers and Artisans, the last two in the Auxiliaries, while the Rulers
            possess all three (432 A note). Thus all the Virtues meet in Justice (<foreign lang="greek">ἐν δὲ δικαιοσύνῃ συλλήβδην πᾶς’ ἀρετή ̓νι</foreign> ap. Arist.
              <title>Eth. Nic.</title> V 3. 1129^{b} 25 ff.) and it is in Justice, not in <foreign lang="greek">σοφία</foreign> (as the historical Socrates held <title>Mem.</title> III
            9. 5), that the true unity of Virtue consists. Plato's Justice is in reality not so much
            a specific virtue, as Virtue or Righteousness in general: <foreign lang="greek">καὶ
              οὔθ’ ἕσπερος οὔθ’ ἑῷος οὕτω θαυμαστός</foreign> (Arist. l.c.): cf. 442 E
            note He desired to build a city, wherein Righteousness dwelleth (<foreign lang="greek">καινοὺς δὲ οὐρανοὺς καὶ γῆν καινὴνπροσδοκῶμεν, ἐν οἷς
              δικαιοσύνη κατοικεῖ</foreign> 1 Pet. 3. 13), and interpreted Righteousness as the
            law of <foreign lang="greek">εἷς &lt;&gt;ν κατὰ φύσιν</foreign>. In taking
            this view of political <foreign lang="greek">δικαιοσύνη</foreign>, there is every
            reason to suppose (with Krohn l.c. p. 46) that Plato was not uninfluenced by the
              <foreign lang="greek">πολυπραγμοσύνη</foreign> (as he conceived it) of Athenian
            democracy, although it is in reality a particular psychological interpretation of

          <p>435A - 435D The point to be determined is this: are there three psychological forms or
            kinds in the soul of the Individual, corresponding to the three orders in our City? And
            is the Individual temperate, brave, wise and just in virtue of the corresponding
            affections of these kinds? Our present methods of investigation are wanting in
            exactness; but they are sufficient for our immediate object.</p>
          <p>ff. The passages in Plato dealing with psychology have been collected and carefully
            expounded by E. W. Simson <title>Der Begriff der Seele bei Plato</title> (Leipzig 1889).
            I have found Simson's treatise more serviceable than Chaignet <title>De la Psychologie
              de Platon</title> (Paris 1862). Dr Brandt's Program <title>Zur Entwickelung der
              Platonischen Lehre von den Seelentheilen</title> (Leipzig 1890) will also be found
            useful in studying the psychological theory here unfolded. For an attempt to shew that
            Plato always believed in the unity of soul see ArcherHind in <title>J. Ph.</title> X pp.
            120&mdash;131. The fundamental principle on which the theory of Book IV should be
            interpreted is that the just soul is an image of the just city. Now the just city is a
              <foreign lang="greek">ἕν</foreign> with three <foreign lang="greek">πολλά</foreign>: so therefore is the just soul. Plato states this quite clearly in 443
            E <foreign lang="greek">ἕνα γενόμενον ἐκ πολλῶν</foreign>. In this sense,
            therefore&mdash;and to Plato it was something real and no mere figure of
            speech&mdash;the soul has unity; but not, strictly speaking, in any other sense;
            otherwise we are in danger of obliterating the distinction between the three orders of
            the city, and so destroying the whole fabric. Of course nothing which Plato now says
            should be taken as prejudging the question about the nature of soul in its <foreign lang="greek">ἀληθεστάτη φύσις</foreign>, i.e. when exempt from all the evils which
            are inseparable from matter (X 611 B ff.): if wholly separated from material accretions
            it is probably <foreign lang="greek">μονοειδές</foreign> (612 A), <foreign lang="greek">λογιστικόν</foreign> alone remaining. See on X 611 B. But for the present we are
            concerned with soul incarnate; and Plato certainly speaks of this as having three parts.
            Cf. Zeller^{4} II 1, pp 845 ff. In what sense an immaterial thing like the soul even
            when present in body can be said to contain &lsquo;parts&rsquo; or
            &lsquo;kinds&rsquo; (<foreign lang="greek">μέρη, εἴδη, γένη</foreign>) is a
            further question, which Plato does not here raise, although his followers have done so.
            It is doubtless true (as Archer-Hind holds l.c.) that &lsquo;parts&rsquo; of
            soul can only be different modes of its operation; and a consciousness of this fact
            seems to betray itself in 439 B, D; but we shall best apprehend the meaning of Plato in
            this passage by treating the analogy as Plato does, i.e. as valid throughout, and
            speaking, in common with Plato and his commentators, of &lsquo;parts&rsquo; of
            soul. See also on 435 B. <pb n="244"/></p>

Brandt l.c. p. 17 and Zeller^{4} II 1, p. 845. <foreign lang="greek">εἴδη ψυχῆς</foreign> does not, strictly speaking, mean &lsquo;<hi rend="italic">varieties</hi> of soul&rsquo; but rather &lsquo;kinds&rsquo;
            belonging to or present in soul (<foreign lang="greek">εἴδη ἐν ψυχῇ</foreign> 439

            time of Plato recognised at least two &lsquo;parts&rsquo; of soul&mdash; an
              <foreign lang="greek">ἄλογον</foreign> and a <foreign lang="greek">λογικόν</foreign> (see Diels <title>Dox. Gr.</title> pp. 389 f. and other evidence in
            Rohde <title>Psyche</title>^{2} II p. 170 note); but Zeller I^{5} pp. 447, 448 may be
            right in regarding the Pythagorean form of this theory as post-Platonic.</p>

            Pfleiderer <hi rend="italic">Zur L&ouml;sung</hi> etc. pp. 25, 73, Hirmer
              <title>Entst. u. Komp.</title> etc. p. 618. <foreign lang="greek">τοῦτο</foreign> in
              <foreign lang="greek">ἀκριβῶς μὲν τοῦτο</foreign> and in <foreign lang="greek">ἡ
              ἐπὶ τοῦτο ἄγουσα</foreign> ought, so far as grammar goes, to mean the question
            whether the soul has <foreign lang="greek">τρία εἴδη</foreign> or not. But the
              <foreign lang="greek">μακροτέρα περίοδος</foreign> in VI 504 B ff., where Plato
            expressly refers back to this passage, eschews the psychological problem altogether. The
              <foreign lang="greek">μακροτέρα περίοδος</foreign> of Books VI&mdash;VII is in
            harmony with the present enquiry in so far as it seeks to determine the nature of
            Justice and the other virtues (VI 504 D, 506 A), but it is nowhere in the Republic
            expressly used either to confirm or to overthrow the triple division of soul which is
            here propounded. (The analysis of mental faculties in VI 509 D&mdash;511 E is
            introductory to the <foreign lang="greek">μακροτέρα περίοδος</foreign>, not a result
            obtained by it; nor has that analysis, strictly speaking, any bearing on the question
            whether soul has three <foreign lang="greek">εἴδη</foreign> or not: cf. Pfleiderer <hi rend="italic">Zur L&ouml;sung</hi> etc. p. 25.) Krohn accordingly <pb n="245"/>
            holds that the &lsquo;longer ways&rsquo; of IV and VI are different and distinct
              (<title>Pl. St.</title> p. 128); and Schleiermacher supposes
            (<title>Einleitung</title> p. 71) that the <foreign lang="greek">πλείων
            ὁδός</foreign> of IV is to be found in the psychology of the <title>Timaeus</title>;
            but that Plato meant the two ways to be identical is certain, for he explicitly says
            that they are (VI 504 B ff.). The only way out of these difficulties is to suppose that
              <foreign lang="greek">τοῦτο</foreign> here was not intended by Plato to refer to the
            psychological, but to the ethical question, to which the psychological enquiry is
            introductory. <foreign lang="greek">τοῦτο</foreign> must then be taken as <foreign lang="greek">δικαιοσύνης τε πέρι καὶ σωφροσύνης καὶ ἀνδρείας καὶ σοφίας δ
              ἕκαστόν ἐστι</foreign> (VI 504 A). This view becomes easy if we suppose that the
            words <foreign lang="greek">καὶ εὖ γεἐξαρκέσει</foreign> were not
            written by Plato immediately after he wrote 435 C, but at a later time, when VI 504
            A&mdash;D was composed. It is in itself highly probable that the most important
            passages referring forward or backward to one another throughout the dialogue were
            either written together, or at all events revised by Plato side by side. Cf. Brandt l.
            c. p. 13 note 3, where a kindred view is taken. In any case, we must adhere to our
            explanation of <foreign lang="greek">τοῦτο</foreign>, if we would preserve the artistic
            unity of the <title>Republic.</title> See also on VI 504 A&mdash;D.</p>

          <p>435E - 439E The presence of three kinds or characters in the city establishes the
            existence of the same characters in the individual; but the question is, do they exist
            in him as three separate elements, or not? Do we employ the whole soul in every
            psychical act, or do we learn with one part, feel angry with a second, desire with a
            third? In examining this question we begin by laying it down that the same thing cannot
            do or suffer opposites at the same time in the same part of itself, and with reference
            to the same thing. This rule is of universal application; apparent exceptions there may
            be, but never real. Desire and Aversion are opposites; and Hunger and Thirst are two
            specific varieties of Desire, relating to meat and drink, considered absolutely and
            without qualification. Now it sometimes happens that we are at one and the same moment
            both thirsty and unwilling to drink, in other words, experience both Desire and
            Aversion. But Desire and Aversion are opposites. They must therefore spring from
            different psychical elements. The truth is, in such cases it is one part of soul, the
            Rational part, which says &lsquo;Refrain!&rsquo;, another, the Appetitive, which
            bids us drink.</p>
          <p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ὅτι γε -- πόλει</lemma>. Broadly speaking, what
            Plato says is true, that the predominant character of a State depends on the predominant
            character of the individual citizens (cf. Bosanquet <title>Companion</title> pp. 147
            f.): but it does not necessarily follow, because a city contains three psychologically
            different classes of citizens, that each of us (<foreign lang="greek">ἑκάστῳ
            ἡμῶν</foreign>) has within his soul the three corresponding psychological elements. In
            making this assertion, Plato relies upon the fundamental hypothesis of the
              <title>Republic</title>, viz. that the individual is a commonwealth writ small. See on
            II 369 A. <foreign lang="greek">γε</foreign> after <foreign lang="greek">ὅτι</foreign>, though omitted in <foreign lang="greek">Ξ</foreign>, is strictly

            conceived in the vein of Hippocrates' enquiries as to the influence of climate on

          <p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ὡς οὐ -- φερομένων</lemma>. This clause has proved
            a source of great perplexity. Schneider suggests that <foreign lang="greek">μενόντων</foreign> is a partitive genitive, <foreign lang="greek">ἐστί</foreign>
            being omitted; Stallbaum, that <foreign lang="greek">τὰ τοιαῦτα</foreign> is
            adverbial, like <foreign lang="greek">τοιουτοτρόπως</foreign>; while, according to J.
            and C., <foreign lang="greek">τὰ τοιαῦτα</foreign> &ldquo;is to be taken as
            cognate accusative with the participles.&rdquo; Rather than accept any of these
            suggestions, it would, I think, be preferable to expunge <foreign lang="greek">τὰ
              τοιαῦτα</foreign> altogether (with Ast), or to place it after <foreign lang="greek">ἀποδεχοίμεθα</foreign> (as Gildersleeve suggests, <title>A. J. Ph.</title> VI p.
            333 note 2), or even perhaps to read <foreign lang="greek">τῶν τοιούτων</foreign> with
            Richards, although little short of a miracle could have corrupted <pb n="248"/>
            <foreign lang="greek">τῶν τοιούτων</foreign> to <foreign lang="greek">τὰ
            τοιαῦτα</foreign>. The following interpretation, which appears to me right, has not, so
            far as I know, been hitherto suggested. <foreign lang="greek">ταὐτά</foreign> goes
            closely with the partitive genitive <foreign lang="greek">ἑαυτῶν</foreign>, and is a
              <hi rend="italic">predicate</hi> to <foreign lang="greek">τὰ τοιαῦτα</foreign>,
            which is also governed by <foreign lang="greek">κατά</foreign> (cf. the familiar usage
            with <foreign lang="greek">ὥσπερ</foreign> and a preposition in similes, e.g. <bibl n="Plat. Theaet. 170A"><title>Theaet.</title> 170 A</bibl>

            ἄρχοντας</foreign> etc.: see on VIII 553 B). <foreign lang="greek">μενόντων τε καὶ
              φερομένων</foreign> is a genitive absolute. The sentence is in every respect an
            elegant and idiomatic piece of Greek, and means: &lsquo;because such parts, in
            respect of which they both stand still and move on these occasions, are <hi rend="italic">different</hi> parts of them.&rsquo; <foreign lang="greek">τὰ
              τοιαῦτα</foreign>&mdash;the meaning of which is easy to catch after the examples

            a few inferior MSS (with the majority of editors) omit. If the words are spurious, no
            satisfactory theory has yet been advanced to account for their presence in the text;
            certainly no scribe is at all likely to have added them. A fuller and more emphatic
            statement of the maxim is natural enough after the emphasis with which the sentence
            opens (<foreign lang="greek">οὐδὲνἐκπλήξει</foreign>), and Schneider

            because e.g. <foreign lang="greek">πλείους γίγνεσθαι</foreign> (an example of <foreign lang="greek">πάσχειν</foreign>) leads up to <foreign lang="greek">πλείους
            εἶναι</foreign>. It should also be observed that the meaning of <foreign lang="greek">πρὸς τὸ αὐτό</foreign>, which the discussion has not yet brought out, is best
            apprehended in examples not of <foreign lang="greek">πάσχειν</foreign> or <foreign lang="greek">ποιεῖν</foreign>, but of <foreign lang="greek">εἶναι

          <p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ἆρ’ οὖν κτλ.</lemma> This discussion (down to 438
            E) is apparently regarded by Susemihl (<title>Gen. Entw.</title> II pp. 163 f.) as
            unnecessary for the immediate purposes of the argument, but it is not so. Plato's object
            is to remove a difficulty which might be felt in holding that desire is restrained, and
            that by the <foreign lang="greek">λογιστικόν</foreign>. Why should thirst be
            restrained? an objector might ask. You yourself, Socrates, hold that (1) desire is
            always of the good; consequently (2) thirst is always the desire of good drink, and (3)
            is therefore always good. See 438 A, where the gist of the objection is contained.
            Socrates would reply: The fallacy lurks in (2), for &lsquo;good&rsquo; drink is
            ambiguous. If &lsquo;good&rsquo; drink means drink which desire <hi rend="italic">thinks</hi> good, then (2) is true; if it means drink which is in
            reality good, (2) is not true. Desire cannot know what is good. We must therefore amend
            (2) by omitting &lsquo;good,&rsquo; for in reality it is sometimes good and
            sometimes bad to drink. To what then is the final appeal? To the <foreign lang="greek">λογιστικόν</foreign>. It is this which decides on each occasion whether it is really
            good or bad to drink, and gives or refuses its assent accordingly (439 C). Bosanquet
            takes a somewhat similar view (<title>Companion</title> p. 154). See also notes on 438
            A.</p>

            with <foreign lang="greek">δίψα</foreign> (which Richards doubts) cf. 439 A. The
            repetition of <foreign lang="greek">δίψα</foreign> is like that of <foreign lang="greek">ἐπιστήμη</foreign> in 438 C, and makes the statement formal and

          <p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ψυχροῦ -- θερμοῦ</lemma>. Hermann transposes these
            words and is followed by Stallbaum, Baiter, and others. &ldquo;Palmaria
            emendatio,&rdquo; cries Stallbaum; whereas J. and C. hold that it &ldquo;makes
            nonsense of the passage.&rdquo; It is not at first sight quite easy to decide
            between these conflicting views. The words <foreign lang="greek">ἐὰν μέν
              τισπροσπαρέχοιτ’ ἄν</foreign> clearly mean that the desire of cold drink
            is due to thirst <hi rend="italic">plus</hi> heat, i.e. thirst supplies the desire of
            drink, and the heat present in the thirst supplies in addition (<foreign lang="greek">προσπαρέχοιτ’ ἄν</foreign>) the desire of cold: see also on <foreign lang="greek">τοῦ δὲπροσγιγνόμενα</foreign> below. This is in harmony with common
            sense and also with the theory of <bibl n="Plat. Lysis 215E"><title>Lys.</title> 215 E</bibl>
            <foreign lang="greek">ἐπιθυμεῖν γὰρ τοῦ τοιούτου</foreign> (sc. <foreign lang="greek">ἐναντίου</foreign>) <foreign lang="greek">ἕκαστον, ἀλλ’ οὐ τοῦ

            also <bibl n="Plat. Sym. 186B"><title>Symp.</title> 186 B</bibl>. But <foreign lang="greek">ἐὰν δὲπολλὴ ἡ δίψα ᾖ</foreign> seems to proceed on
            the opposite or homoeopathic principle. The presence of <foreign lang="greek">πλῆθος</foreign> produces a desire not for its opposite but for itself. The solution
            of the difficulty is to be found in the different character of the notions <foreign lang="greek">θερμότης</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">πλῆθος.
            θερμότης</foreign> is something distinct from <foreign lang="greek">δίψος</foreign>,
            though superadded to it, for which reason Plato does not use the expression <foreign lang="greek">θερμὸν δίψος</foreign>; whereas <foreign lang="greek">πλῆθος</foreign>
            is in reality <foreign lang="greek">πλῆθος δίψης</foreign>, and <foreign lang="greek">πολλὴ δίψα</foreign>, as experience shews, desires much drink. The common sense
            point of view is taken by Plato throughout, and is expressly justified by him in 438 E
              <foreign lang="greek">οὔ τι λέγω ὡς οἵων ἂν ᾖ, τοιαῦτα καὶ
            ἔστιν</foreign>. For these reasons I heartily agree with the Oxford editors. Hermann's
            proposal is a product of the inveterate tendency to suppose that wherever we turn in
            Plato we rub against the theory of Ideas; but the use of <foreign lang="greek">παρουσία</foreign> here (in spite of Peiper's <title>Ontol. Pl.</title> pp. 602 ff.,
            Zeller^{4} II 1, p. 560 note, and many other critics) is not metaphysical, but logical,
            and <foreign lang="greek">πλῆθος</foreign> is certainly not an Idea in this passage.

            Here, as always, Socrates would of course concede that all men desire the good; but we
            need the <foreign lang="greek">λογιστικόν</foreign> in each act of desire to specify
            what the good really is (437 D note). Moreover, according to our present theory, the
            desire of good drink is the product of <hi rend="italic">two</hi> desires, viz. (1)
            thirst or the desire of drink, and (2) the desire of good. That (2) is in a certain
            sense universal, does not alter the fact that the two desires are logically distinct.

            correlates with <foreign lang="greek">μάθημα, οἰκοδομία</foreign> with <foreign lang="greek">οἰκίας ἐργασία</foreign>, so that <foreign lang="greek">ἐπιστήμη

            the corruption (through <foreign lang="greek">ἐγγίνηται</foreign>) easy enough.
              <foreign lang="greek">ὄταν ἐγγένηται</foreign> could scarcely mean <foreign lang="greek">ἑκάστοτε</foreign>, which is the meaning here required. The subject to
              <foreign lang="greek">ἐγγίγνηται</foreign> is <foreign lang="greek">τὸ

            between reason and desire. See 431 C and 437 D note Reason readily acquiesces when it is
            good to gratify desire. <foreign lang="greek">τὰἄγοντα καὶ
            ἕλκοντα</foreign> is translated by Jowett &lsquo;that which bids and
            attracts&rsquo;: but <foreign lang="greek">ἄγοντα</foreign> is said like <foreign lang="greek">ἄγοντος</foreign> in 439 B and <foreign lang="greek">ἕλκοντα</foreign> is &lsquo;dragging.&rsquo; The plural should also be
            retained in the translation, otherwise <foreign lang="greek">τὰ ἄγοντα</foreign> may
            be identified with the <foreign lang="greek">ἐπιθυμητικόν</foreign>, which would be a
            mistake, for the appetitive part of soul is certainly not <hi rend="italic">produced</hi> by <foreign lang="greek">παθήματα</foreign> of any kind. <foreign lang="greek">τὰ ἄγοντα καὶ ἔλκοντα</foreign> are in reality &lsquo;impulses
            leading and dragging&rsquo; the soul, impulses engendered by &lsquo;particular
            conditions and diseases&rsquo; (not &lsquo;passive states&rsquo; or
            &lsquo;passion,&rsquo; etc. with the English translators), i.e. in other words
            by abnormal bodily states favourable to desires, as for example fevers etc.: cf. <bibl n="Plat. Phileb. 45A"><title>Phil.</title> 45 A</bibl>, B. These impulses are no doubt
            special instances of the action of <foreign lang="greek">ἐπιθυμητικόν</foreign>, but
            should be distinguished from the appetitive principle itself.</p>

            frequently contends. Its function is to support the Rational part of the soul. In a man
            of noble character the spirited element is quiescent or the reverse in accordance with
            the commands of Reason. It must not however be identified with Reason; for it is present
            in children and the lower animals, whereas Reason is not. Homer also recognises that the

            continued throughout this section. It should be noted however that the parallel is no
            longer quite exact. The difference between <foreign lang="greek">θυμοειδές</foreign>
            and <foreign lang="greek">λογιστικόν</foreign> in the soul is greater than that between

            is not a select part of the <foreign lang="greek">θυμοειδές</foreign>&mdash;as the
            rulers are of the soldiers&mdash;but something generically distinct from it.
            Otherwise the analogy holds (with the reservations mentioned on 435 A). Cf. Steinhart

            the natural antithesis of <foreign lang="greek">φιλόσοφον</foreign> (II 375 A ff., III
            410 D, 411 C). It now enters on a wider sphere as the ally of <foreign lang="greek">λογιστικόν</foreign>, and becomes, thus far, more intellectual, as Krohn points out:
            note also the <foreign lang="greek">ὀρθὴ δόξα</foreign> of 430 B. Its ethical
            connotation is also intensified; for it is not now simply spirit, but the sentiment of
            moral indignation at everything evil&mdash; &ldquo;ein edler Unwille
            &uuml;ber alles Schlechte&rdquo; (Krohn <title>Pl. St.</title> p.
            55)&mdash;everything which tends to destroy the <foreign lang="greek">πολιτεία ἐν

              d. Seelentheilen</title> p. 18) says truly enough though ponderously,
            &ldquo;leidenschaftlicher Selbsterhaltungs- und

            (Liebhold <title>Fl. Jahrb.</title> 1888 p. 110), <foreign lang="greek">τινος</foreign>
            (Zeller <title>Archiv f. Gesch. d. Phil.</title> II p. 694)&mdash;all superfluous,
            and the first two very weak; while Campbell suggests that <foreign lang="greek">οὐ</foreign> has dropped before <foreign lang="greek">πιστεύω</foreign>, taking
              <foreign lang="greek">τούτῳ</foreign> to refer to Glauco's suggestion. But in that

            the walls, in the deme <foreign lang="greek">Κειριάδαι</foreign>. Leontius would pass
            near it, just before entering the city (probably by the <foreign lang="greek">Μελιτίδες πύλαι</foreign>): see Curtius u. Kaupert l.c. Bl. II. The place is still
            pointed out to visitors to Athens on the western declivity of the Hill of the Nymphs.

              <foreign lang="greek">δημιείῳ</foreign> is a coinage of his own, and otherwise
            objectionable; <foreign lang="greek">Αυκείῳ</foreign> (also Valckenaer) is
            topographically impossible, and so is <foreign lang="greek">Διομείῳ</foreign>
            (Hemsterhuis), if it has anything to do with the <foreign lang="greek">Διομηΐς

          <p>441C - 443B Thus we see that the soul contains within itself the same kinds or elements
            as our city. It follows that the individual is wise, brave etc. in the same way and in
            virtue of the same internal elements. We are therefore just when each of our
            psychological factors does its own work. Reason should rule, with Spirit for its
            obedient ally; and both of them together, harmonised by music and gymnastic, will
            control Desire, and ward off foreign enemies from soul and body. The individual is brave
            in virtue of the element of Spirit, if in spite of pain and pleasure that element
            continues faithful to the commands of Reason touching what should and should not be
            feared; wise, by reason of the part of soul that rules and knows; temperate, through the
            harmony of ruled and ruler on the question which shall rule; and just, in virtue of our
            oftrepeated principle. We may examine our view of Justice by various tests derived from
            the popular connotation of the word, and we shall find that we are right.</p>
          <p>ff. The parallel between the City and the Soul is maintained throughout this section.
            Like the City, the Soul is also wise and brave, in virtue of the wisdom and courage of
            its parts, and temperate and just for similar reasons (see on <foreign lang="greek">τί
              τὴν πόλιν προσαγορεύεις</foreign> 428 D); the relation between <foreign lang="greek">λογιστικόν, θυμοειδές</foreign>, and <foreign lang="greek">ἐπιθυμητικόν</foreign> is the same as that between the three orders of the city
            (see however on 442 C); and the specific virtues are defined in the same way. Finally,
            as Justice in the State was at last identified with Righteousness or Moral Perfection,
            so likewise is Justice in the soul (442 E&mdash;443 B).</p>

            analogy between the city and the soul is not quite exact, otherwise it would be the
            rulers in the city who prescribe <foreign lang="greek">τὸ δεινόν τε καὶ
            μή</foreign>, whereas it is the legislator (see on <foreign lang="greek">ὁ

              (<title>Pl. St.</title> p. 43). Unless Plato made the Deity the <foreign lang="greek">οἰκιστής</foreign> of the soul, as the original legislator is of the city, it was
            impossible for him to avoid placing the <foreign lang="greek">λογιστικόν</foreign> in a
            position of even greater authority than the rulers. In Books VI and VII the inequality
            is redressed by making the power of the Rulers in the city commensurate with that of
              <foreign lang="greek">λόγος</foreign> in the soul: see VI 497 C note</p>
          <p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ἦρχέν τε κτλ.</lemma>: &lsquo;ruled within him

            must be given <hi rend="italic">before</hi> they can be obeyed by <foreign lang="greek">θυμοειδές</foreign>, as described in the last sentence. J. and C. say that <foreign lang="greek">ἦρχε</foreign> refers to 428 E; but Plato is not there speaking of the
            individual, only of the State. Although a reference to 439 C or 441 E is barely
            possible, it is much simpler to regard the imperfect as real, and not
            &lsquo;philosophic.&rsquo; See above on III 406 E. Schneider, to judge from his
            translation, takes the same view. With <foreign lang="greek">σμικρῷ μέρει</foreign>
            cf. Arist. <title>Eth. Nic.</title> X 7. 1177^{b} 34 ff. <foreign lang="greek">εἰ γὰρ
              καὶ τῷ ὄγκῳ μικρόν ἐστι</foreign> (sc. <foreign lang="greek">τὸ κράτιστον

          <p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">αὖ κἀκεῖνο κτλ.</lemma>
            <foreign lang="greek"> αὖ καί</foreign> has been interpreted (1) as implying that the

            State&rsquo;: cf. 428 B ff. The first view is slightly more natural on linguistic
            grounds, but I think Plato would hardly have attributed <foreign lang="greek">ἐπιστήμη</foreign> in any shape to the <foreign lang="greek">θυμοειδές</foreign>.
            Probably (2) is right, for the analogy between the <pb n="261"/> city and the soul is in
            Plato's mind all through this section: see 441 C, D, and 442 D.</p>

            Justice has now &lsquo;passed into&rsquo; the Individual; and no feature has
            been blunted, or lost its clearness of outline. We are therefore confirmed in our view

          <p>443B - 444A We were right then in suspecting that Justice in a certain shape was with
            us from the first when we founded our city. But the principle that every one should do
            his professional work and no more, is in reality only an image or shadow of Justice.
            True Justice is concerned with the inner man and consists in the performance of its own
            peculiar office by each if the three elements within the soul. It is this which produces
            spiritual unity, and spiritual unity shews itself in outward acts. We may now claim to
            have discovered Justice both in the City and in the Individual.</p>
          <p>ff. This section deals with the relation between Civic and Individual virtue. Although
            we discovered the latter by means of the former, it is the virtue of the soul which is
            alone original; the other, its outward expression, is but a copy. All true virtue
            therefore rests upon psychology; not yet, as in VI and VII, on the metaphysical
            knowledge of the Idea of Good. The full meaning of Plato's &lsquo;natural
            city&rsquo; (<foreign lang="greek">κατὰ φύσιν οἰκισθεῖσα πόλις</foreign>) now
            appears. It is a commonwealth whose institutions and political life are the outward
            expression or embodiment of the true and uncorrupted nature of the soul, regarded as in
            very truth a <foreign lang="greek">φυτὸν οὐκ ἔγγειον, ἀλλ’ οὐράνιον</foreign>
              (<bibl n="Plat. Tim. 90A"><title>Tim.</title> 90 A</bibl>). Hence arise the three
            orders of the city; hence too, each order performs its own function; for it is part of
            soul's &lsquo;nature&rsquo; <foreign lang="greek">τὰ ἑαυτῆς
            πράττειν</foreign>, and <foreign lang="greek">πολυπραγμονεῖν</foreign> is a
            consequence of unnatural degeneration (441 A). This optimistic view of
            &lsquo;nature&rsquo; is noteworthy. It rests on the wide-spread Greek belief
            that good is natural, and evil unnatural; cf. infra 444 D and Aristotle's <foreign lang="greek">ὁ δὲ θεὸς καὶ ἡ φύσις οὐδὲν μάτην ποιοῦσι</foreign> (<hi rend="italic">de Caelo</hi> I 4. 271^{a} 33), <foreign lang="greek">οὐδὲν τῶν παρὰ
              φύσιν καλόν</foreign> (<title>Pol.</title> H 3. 1325^{b} 10) and the like. For more
            on this subject I may be allowed to refer to my essay on <title>Classical
            Education</title>, Deighton, Bell and Co. 1895 pp. 12 ff. Although not itself expressly
            a deduction from the theory of Ideas, Plato's conception of &lsquo;nature&rsquo;
            as good and not evil is altogether in harmony with the sovereignty of the Idea of Good
            in Book VI: see on 505 A ff.</p>

            me better than the present. See II 368 D ff. Plato is justifying himself for having
            taken so much trouble about a mere <foreign lang="greek">εἴδωλον</foreign>; it was in
            order to learn the original through the copy. So also Hartman. The present could only
            mean &lsquo;benefits the city&rsquo; (so Schneider, Rettig and others). Madvig,
            strangely enough, suspects the whole phrase. Civic Justice is an <foreign lang="greek">εἴδωλον</foreign> of Justice in the soul as being its reflection in outward
            conduct. See also on 443 B ff. above.</p>

            is said to be <foreign lang="greek">περὶ τὴν ἐντὸς πρᾶξιν</foreign>, and is
            therefore not, strictly speaking, that which we have called &lsquo;Civic

            before <foreign lang="greek">ἑαυτόν</foreign> as coordinate with <foreign lang="greek">περί</foreign> in <foreign lang="greek">περὶ τὴν ἐντός</foreign>, than to

            where a similar image is employed. The figure here is taken from the Octachord, the
              <foreign lang="greek">λογιστικόν</foreign> being represented by the <foreign lang="greek">ὑπάτη</foreign> or highest string (which gave out the lowest note), the
              <foreign lang="greek">ἐπιθυμητικόν</foreign> by the <foreign lang="greek">νεάτη</foreign> (an octave higher in pitch), and the <foreign lang="greek">θυμοειδές</foreign> by the <foreign lang="greek">μέση</foreign> or fourth. See
              <title>Dict. Ant.</title> II p. 195 or Gleditsch <title>Die Musik d. Gr.</title> p.
            860. The single notes of a <foreign lang="greek">ἁρμονία</foreign> could be called
              <foreign lang="greek">ὅροι</foreign> because they were in reality terms in a
            proportion and depended on the relative length of the string: cf. <bibl n="Plat. Tim. 35B"><title>Tim.</title> 35 B</bibl>, C. Hartman's correction of
              <foreign lang="greek">νεάτης, ὑπάτης, μέσης</foreign> to <foreign lang="greek">νεάτην, ὑπάτην, μέσην</foreign> is very attractive: for the genitives can only be
            explained as <foreign lang="greek">ὅρον νεάτης</foreign> etc., and the effect is
            unpleasing, especially with <pb n="264"/>
            <foreign lang="greek">ἁρμονίας</foreign> coming between. Retaining the Greek
            nomenclature, we may translate: &lsquo;having harmoniously joined together three
            different elements, just like three terms in a musical proportion or scale, lowest and
            highest and intermediate,&rsquo; etc. In <foreign lang="greek">ἄλλα ἄττα
            μεταξύ</foreign> Plato indicates (as J. and C. observe) that his threefold division of
            soul may not be &lsquo;strictly exhaustive&rsquo; (cf. VIII 548 D note). The
            missing faculties would thus correspond to the notes intervening between the <foreign lang="greek">ὑπάτη</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">μέση</foreign>, and the
              <foreign lang="greek">μέση</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">νεάτη</foreign>. It
            will be noted that the unity resulting is not that of unison, but that of a scale or
            mode. Nevertheless it is clear from the language used that the <foreign lang="greek">ἁρμονία</foreign> which Plato describes is, as before, <foreign lang="greek">σωφροσύνη</foreign>: cf. <foreign lang="greek">ἄρξαντα αὐτὸν αὑτοῦ</foreign>
            with 431 A, B, <foreign lang="greek">φίλον γενόμενον</foreign> with 442 C; <foreign lang="greek">κοσμήσαντα</foreign> too suggests <foreign lang="greek">κοσμιότης</foreign>, and the word <foreign lang="greek">σώφρονα</foreign> itself is
            finally employed. Cf. 434 C note A different explanation is given by the Scholiast.
            Holding that Plato is referring to a system of two octaves (<foreign lang="greek">δὶς
              διὰ πασῶν</foreign>) he explains <foreign lang="greek">νεάτη, μέση</foreign> and
              <foreign lang="greek">ὑπάτη</foreign> as e.g. A', A, and <hi rend="italic">b</hi>
            (not <hi rend="italic">a</hi>, which is the <foreign lang="greek">προσλαμβανόμενος</foreign>). His note is as follows: <foreign lang="greek">νεάτη
              ἤγουν νήτη ὑπερβολαίων ἡ ἐσχάτη χορδὴ τοῦ δὶς διὰ πασῶν συστήματος,
              ὑπάτη δὲ ἡ μετὰ τὸν προλαμβανόμενον</foreign> (leg. <foreign lang="greek">προσλαμβανόμενον</foreign>) <foreign lang="greek">φθόγγον πρώτη χορδὴ τοῦ
              αὐτοῦ τοῦ δὶς διὰ πασῶν συστήματος. μέση δὲ καὶ αὐτὴ ἤτοι φθόγγος ἢ
              χορδὴ ἡ τελευταία μὲν τοῦ πρώτου διὰ πασῶν, ἀρχὴ δὲ τοῦ δευτέρου, ὡς
              εἶναι τούτων κοινήν, ὡς Πτολεμαῖός τέ φησι καὶ οἱ ἄλλοι
            μουσικοί</foreign>. But in the <foreign lang="greek">δὶς διὰ πασῶν
            σύστημα</foreign>, the <foreign lang="greek">ὑπάτη</foreign> is not <foreign lang="greek">σύμφωνος</foreign> with the <foreign lang="greek">νήτη
            ὑπερβολαίων</foreign>, although the <foreign lang="greek">προσλαμβανόμενος</foreign>
            of course is (see Gleditsch l.c. p. 861 and Euclid <title>Sect. Can.</title> 10 ed. von
            Jan): so that according to the Scholiast there is a serious breach of <foreign lang="greek">συμφωνία</foreign>. It seems to me quite clear that in <foreign lang="greek">ὥσπερ ὅρους τρεῖσμέσης</foreign> Plato is thinking of
            three <foreign lang="greek">ξύμφωνοι φθόγγοι</foreign>, and in the <hi rend="italic">single</hi> octave or <foreign lang="greek">διὰ πασῶν</foreign>, the <foreign lang="greek">ὑπάτη, μέση</foreign> or fourth, and <foreign lang="greek">νεάτη</foreign> were <foreign lang="greek">σύμφωνα ἀλλήλοις</foreign>: see Cleonid.
              <title>Isag. Harm.</title> 5 ed. von Jan. In 432 A also, Plato contemplates only a

          <p>444A - 444E Injustice, like every variety of Vice, implies sedition and confusion among

            reserved for Books VIII and IX, where Plato takes the subject in its proper order,
            considering civic injustice first, and afterwards that of the individual. At present he
            contents himself with a preliminary or exoteric sketch of Injustice in the soul,
            representing it as unrighteousness in general, just as Justice, both in the State and in
            the individual, has been identified with righteousness or moral perfection (434 C, 442 E

            reading of <foreign lang="greek">Ξ</foreign> and other inferior MSS, which (in common
            with all the editors) I have printed above, seems to be an attempt to emend the older
            and more difficult reading preserved in <foreign lang="greek">Α</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">Π</foreign>. Stallbaum supposes that A here represents a corruption of
              <foreign lang="greek">Ξ, αὖ δουλεύειν</foreign> being presumably a correction (of
              <foreign lang="greek">αὐτῳ δουλεύειν</foreign>) which has crept into the text; but
            this is unlikely in itself, and also leaves <foreign lang="greek">τοῦ δ̓</foreign>
            before <foreign lang="greek">αὖ δουλεύειν</foreign> unexplained. The text of <foreign lang="greek">Ξ</foreign> is not in itself quite satisfactory, as Richards has pointed
            out. <foreign lang="greek">οἵου πρέπειν αὐτῷ</foreign> for <foreign lang="greek">ὥστε πρέπειν αὐτῷ</foreign> seems unexampled, although <foreign lang="greek">οἵου δουλεύειν</foreign> would of course be right. The expression <foreign lang="greek">τῷ τοῦ ἀρχικοῦ γένους ὄντι</foreign>, &lsquo;that which is of
            the ruling class,&rsquo; is also curious for the more direct and accurate <foreign lang="greek">τῷ ἀρχικῷ γένει</foreign>. The reading of A and <foreign lang="greek">Π</foreign> yields no tolerable sense, and certainly cannot come from
            Plato. Madvig (with Vind. E) proposes <foreign lang="greek">οἵου πρέπειν αὐτῷ

            surprised if the whole clause <foreign lang="greek">ἀλλὰ ὄντι</foreign>,
            as it appears in A and <foreign lang="greek">Π</foreign>, is only an attempt by some

            represented as a plurality, and we have heard nothing of a king. In the later books
            (from V 473 C onwards) we often hear of kingship; and in IX 576 D (as Newman points out

          <p>I hope my note has proved that this sentence is sound in the main; but Madvig's
            emendation has obtained such a wide currency, owing to its adoption by Baiter, that the
            text has fallen under grave suspicion, and it may be well to record the different
            conjectures.</p>
          <p>They are as follows:</p>
          <p>(1) <foreign lang="greek">εἶεν οὖν· ἡμεῖς κτλ.</foreign> (Orelli, cited by
            Schneider): (2) <foreign lang="greek">ἡμεῖς μὲν οὖν φύλακας κτλ.</foreign> (Ast in
            his third edition): (3) <foreign lang="greek">ᾗ μὲν οὖν ἡμεῖς
              &lt;λέγο&gt;μεν, φύλακας κτλ.</foreign> (Herwerden, with whom Hartman agrees
            so far, although Hartman goes further and expunges <foreign lang="greek">καί</foreign>
            before <foreign lang="greek">ὥσπερ</foreign> as well as the entire clause <foreign lang="greek">ἄλλο ἄν τι ἢ πόλιν λέγοι</foreign>): (4) <foreign lang="greek">εἰ μὲν οὖνἑστιάτορας, εὔδαιμον ἄλλο ἄν τι ἢ πόλιν
            λέγοι</foreign> (Madvig): (5) <foreign lang="greek">εἰ</foreign> [<foreign lang="greek">μὲν</foreign>] <foreign lang="greek">οὖν ἡμεῖσλέγων
              ἀργούς</foreign> (or <foreign lang="greek">κακούργους</foreign>) <foreign lang="greek">τινασεὐδαίμονας, ἄλλο δή τι ἢ πόλιν λέγει</foreign>
            (Richards).</p>
          <p>It should be mentioned also that Wyttenbach (quoted by Stallbaum) had conjectured
              <foreign lang="greek">ἑστιάτορας καὶ δαιτυμόνας</foreign> instead of <foreign lang="greek">ἑστιάτορας εὐδαίμονας</foreign> (<foreign lang="greek">ἑστιάτορας
              καὶ εὐδαίμονας</foreign> in a few inferior MSS).</p>
          <p>A glance at these proposals will shew that the difficulties felt have been chiefly in
            connexion with a <foreign lang="greek">εἰ μὲν οὖν ἡμεῖς μέν</foreign>, b <foreign lang="greek">γεωργούς</foreign>, c <foreign lang="greek">ἑστιάτορας
            εὐδαίμονας</foreign> and d <foreign lang="greek">ἄλλο ἄν τι ἢ πόλιν
            λέγοι</foreign>. I can see no reason for Richards' correction of d:
            &lsquo;mixed&rsquo; conditional sentences of this kind are surely common enough.</p>
          <p>For <foreign lang="greek">ἑστιάτορας εὐδαίμονας</foreign> cf. III 420 A <foreign lang="greek">οἱ εὐδαίμονες δοκοῦντες εἶναι</foreign> and especially X 612 A
              <foreign lang="greek">τῶν εὐδαιμόνων λεγομένων ἑστιάσεων</foreign>. The <foreign lang="greek">μέν</foreign> after <foreign lang="greek">εἰ</foreign> is omitted in
            one Florentine MS, but <foreign lang="greek">μέν</foreign> without <foreign lang="greek">δέ</foreign> occurs tolerably often in Plato (cf. V 475 E note). Here it
            has the effect of italicising the preceding word by suggesting a possible antithesis.
            The only real difficulty is in <foreign lang="greek">γεωργούς</foreign>, and in view of
            419 A to which <foreign lang="greek">ὁ δ’ ἐκεῖνο λέγων</foreign> refers, some may
            doubt whether even <foreign lang="greek">γεωργούς</foreign> is not also genuine. For my
            own part I am inclined to think that Plato wrote <foreign lang="greek">λεωργούς</foreign>. </p>

          <p>The reading <foreign lang="greek">φαίνονται</foreign>, which replaces <foreign lang="greek">λέγοντες</foreign> in A^{1}, <foreign lang="greek">Π</foreign> and a
            majority of MSS, is admittedly corrupt. One Florentine MS has <foreign lang="greek">λέγοντες φαίνονται</foreign>, another <foreign lang="greek">φαίνονται
            λέγοντες</foreign>: and it is possible that <foreign lang="greek">φαίνονται</foreign>
            was originally only an adscript intended to be taken with <foreign lang="greek">λέγοντες</foreign>. The emendations proceed for the most part on the assumption that
              <foreign lang="greek">λέγοντες</foreign> and not <foreign lang="greek">φαίνονται</foreign> is the gloss. This may be so, but unfortunately no satisfactory
            remedy has yet been suggested on these lines. The most important corrections are
              <foreign lang="greek">ἀποφαίνονται</foreign> (Cornarius), <foreign lang="greek">φαίνοντα</foreign> (Madvig, taking the participle in agreement with <foreign lang="greek">κόσμος</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">ἐγκράτεια</foreign>, but
              <foreign lang="greek">φαίνοντα</foreign> cannot be used for <foreign lang="greek">ἀπεργαζόμενα</foreign>, as Hartman points out), <foreign lang="greek">φαίνεσθαι</foreign> (Hartman, who connects the infinitive with <foreign lang="greek">φασί</foreign>, and construes <foreign lang="greek">ὡς</foreign> boldly as <hi rend="italic">quoniam</hi>). Other corrections enumerated by Hartman are <foreign lang="greek">φασίν τινα</foreign> (Dobree), <foreign lang="greek">φαμέν</foreign>
            (Badham), <foreign lang="greek">ἀποφαίνοντες</foreign> (Richards). Apelt has thought
            of cancelling the entire clause <foreign lang="greek">κρείττω
            δὴτρόπον</foreign> as an &ldquo;interpretatio etymologica ad
            praegressam vocem <foreign lang="greek">ἐγκράτεια</foreign> pertinens&rdquo;
              (<title>Obs. cr. in Pl. dialogos</title>, p. 11). It would be easy to multiply
            conjectures of this sort; but until something better is proposed, we should hold fast to
              <foreign lang="greek">λέγοντες</foreign>. The <foreign lang="greek">λέγεται</foreign> of the next sentence suits <foreign lang="greek">λέγοντες</foreign>
            very well, for the phrase <foreign lang="greek">κρείττω αὑτοῦ</foreign> is itself one
            of the <foreign lang="greek">ἴχνη</foreign>. I have placed a full stop before <foreign lang="greek">καὶ ἄλλα</foreign>. Ast suggested a colon, and wished to add <foreign lang="greek">ἅ</foreign> after <foreign lang="greek">τοιαῦτα</foreign>, but no
            change is necessary. </p>

            far as its essence is concerned,&rdquo; J. and C.). This interpretation is
            grammatically awkward, and otherwise objectionable, inasmuch as it anticipates <foreign lang="greek">δίψος δ’ οὖν αὐτό</foreign> below. Plato evidently means to present
            his argument in two steps: (1) Thirst, as you will agree, is something relative to
            drink, (2) Thirst qualified is relative to drink qualified, and thirst by itself,
            without qualification, to drink by itself, without qualification.</p>
          <p>A large number of emendations has been proposed. The late Mr W. A. Gill was inclined to
            omit <foreign lang="greek">τοῦτο ὅπερ ἐστίν</foreign> (<title>Proceedings of the
              Cambridge Philol. Soc.</title> XVIII p. 35), and Hartman boldly expunges the words,
            leaving <foreign lang="greek">ἔστι δὲ δήπου δίψος</foreign>, as it appears to me,
            in a lonely and unsheltered situation. The suggestion <foreign lang="greek">τῶν οἵων
              τινος</foreign> (Madvig), i.e. &lsquo;which are such as to be that which they are
            relatively to something,&rsquo; is very cumbrous, and renders <foreign lang="greek">ἔστι δὲ δήπου δίψος</foreign> far from natural. Mr Cook Wilson's defence or
            explanation of Madvig's proposal in the <title>Academy</title> no. 824 (Feb. 18, 1888)
            does not carry conviction to my mind. Baiter combines the conjecture of Madvig with
            Morgenstern's <foreign lang="greek">δή του</foreign> for <foreign lang="greek">δήπου</foreign>, in which case Socrates repeats his question, if <foreign lang="greek">ἔστι δὲ δήπου δίψος</foreign> is interrogative, or, if not, answers it himself.
            It <pb n="271"/> seems to me clear that <foreign lang="greek">ἔστι δὲ δήπου
            δίψος</foreign> is intended to explain <foreign lang="greek">τοῦτο ὅπερ
            ἐστίν</foreign> and nothing more. J. and C. translate &ldquo;Thirst is, I
            imagine&mdash; Yes, said he, thirst is of drink,&rdquo; remarking that
            &ldquo;two questions are asked; before the second is completed Glauco breaks in with
            a reply to the first (<foreign lang="greek">ἔγωγε</foreign>): and in <foreign lang="greek">πώματός γε</foreign> he completes and answers the second.&rdquo; I
            can see no occasion for so much impatience on Glauco's part. The insertion of <foreign lang="greek">καὶ τινός</foreign> after <foreign lang="greek">τῶν τινός</foreign>
            appears to me to solve all the difficulties, and the error is of a kind that frequently
            occurs in our oldest MS. See <title>Introd.</title> &sect; 5. </p>

          <p>The difficulties of this passage have been much canvassed. The only important variant
            is <foreign lang="greek">ἐν ἑαυτῷ</foreign> (<foreign lang="greek">Π</foreign> and
            corr. A^{2}, with several other MSS) instead of <foreign lang="greek">ἐν
            σαυτῷ...Π</foreign> does not, as Bekker asserted, give <foreign lang="greek">μηδέν</foreign>, but <foreign lang="greek">μὴ δεῖν</foreign> like A. The <foreign lang="greek">ἄν τι πράττειν</foreign> for <foreign lang="greek">ἀντιπράττειν</foreign> of <hi rend="italic">q</hi>, although adopted by Bekker, is
            indefensible, as other editors have observed, for <foreign lang="greek">ἄν</foreign>
            has no meaning or construction.</p>
          <p>Against the ordinary interpretation, which I have given in the notes, it has been urged
            that <foreign lang="greek">θυμός</foreign> does, in point of fact, sometimes join with
            the Desires against the Reason. Thus in the degenerate phases of character depicted in
            VIII 553 C ff. and elsewhere, <foreign lang="greek">θυμοειδές</foreign> is the slave
            and minister of the <foreign lang="greek">ἐπιθυμητικόν</foreign>, and in 441 A
              <foreign lang="greek">ἐπίκουρον ὂν τῷ λογιστικῷ φύσει ἐὰν μὴ ὑπὸ κακῆς
              τροφῆς διαφθαρῇ</foreign>, the same implication appears to be involved. Cf. Krohn
              <title>Pl. St.</title> pp. 52 ff. But in such cases the <foreign lang="greek">λογιστικόν</foreign> would seem also to be corrupted (<foreign lang="greek">τὸ δέ
              γε, οἶμαι, λογιστικόν τε καὶ θυμοειδὲς χαμαὶ ἔνθεν καὶ ἔνθεν παρακαθίσας
              ὑπ’ ἐκείνῳ</foreign>&mdash;sc. <foreign lang="greek">τῷ
              ἐπιθυμητικῷκαὶ καταδουλωσάμενος</foreign> VIII l.c.), so that there is
            no conflict between the allied forces of the <foreign lang="greek">θυμοειδές</foreign>
            and <foreign lang="greek">ἐπιθυμητικόν</foreign> on the one hand and the <foreign lang="greek">λογιστικόν</foreign> on the other. It is true that the language of 441
            A, taken in its full force, appears to imply that the <foreign lang="greek">θυμοειδές</foreign> can be corrupted without the <foreign lang="greek">λογιστικόν</foreign>, but Plato would hardly, I think, have held such a view, and the
            implication is not to be pressed. See <bibl n="Plat. Phaedrus 253D"><title>Phaedr.</title> 253 D</bibl>&mdash;256 E. There is some difficulty about
            the construction of <foreign lang="greek">ἀντιπράττειν</foreign>, and Hartman would
            expunge the word. Schneider's punctuation, which I have adopted, connects it with
              <foreign lang="greek">δεῖν</foreign>. Others make its subject <foreign lang="greek">αὐτόν</foreign> (&lsquo;but that <foreign lang="greek">θυμός</foreign>, having
            made common cause with the desires, when Reason forbids, should oppose
            Reason&mdash;this&rsquo; etc.). The explanation of Hermann (adopted also by
            Schmelzer) avoids the anacoluthon, but is exceedingly tortuous and unpleasing:
            &lsquo;I think you would not say that you have perceived <foreign lang="greek">θυμός</foreign> making common cause with the desires and opposing Reason when Reason
            forbade&rsquo; etc. Richter also (<title>Fl. Jahrb.</title> 1867 p. 139) evades the
            anacoluthon by defending the more than dubious construction <foreign lang="greek">αἰσθέσθαι αὐτὸν κοινωνήσαντα</foreign>. <pb n="272"/> Finally Nitzsch
            conjectures (<title>Rh. Mus.</title> 1857 p. 472) <foreign lang="greek">μὴ δεῖν
              &lt;τι πράττειν&gt;, ἀντιπράττειν</foreign>, or <foreign lang="greek">μηδ’
              εἶν&lt;αί τι πράττειν&gt;, ἀντιπράττειν</foreign>. None of these devices
            seems to me so probable as Schneider's view.</p>
          <p>An entirely different view of this passage is suggested by a Scholiast's note, to which
            Warren has recently again called attention. The Scholium runs: <foreign lang="greek">ὁ
              δὲ νοῦς οὗτος. ταῖς δὲ ἐπιθυμίαις σε κοινωνήσαντα ταῖς εὐλογίστοις, καὶ
              γινώσκοντά σε τοῦτο ἐκ τῆς πείρας, οὐχ ὑπολαμβάνω σε εἰπεῖν ὅτι
              ᾔσθημαι ἐν ταῖς τοιαύταις ἀγαθαῖς ἡδοναῖς τὸν θυμὸν ἀντιπράττοντα ταῖς
              ἐπιθυμίαις, ὥσπερ ἐπὶ ταῖς τοῦ Λεοντίου ἀλόγοις ἡδοναῖς
            ἀντέπραττεν</foreign>. It is obvious that the Scholiast connected <foreign lang="greek">σε</foreign> with <foreign lang="greek">αὐτόν</foreign> and took the
            sentence to mean, broadly speaking, that when Reason on the other hand <hi rend="italic">sanctions</hi> indulgence (<foreign lang="greek">αἱροῦντος λόγου μὴ δεῖν
              ἀντιπράττειν</foreign> SC. <foreign lang="greek">ταῖς ἐπιθυμίαις</foreign>), we
            do not find any conflict between <foreign lang="greek">θυμός</foreign> and the desires.
            The meaning is satisfactory, and furnishes a fair antithesis to the first half of the
            sentence <foreign lang="greek">ὅταν βιάζωνταιτοῦ τοιούτου</foreign>, but
            it is difficult to reconcile this view with the Greek as we have it. Warren, who
            sympathises in general with the Scholiast, translates &ldquo;but that dealing with
            desires it&rdquo;&mdash;viz. <foreign lang="greek">θυμός</foreign>&mdash;&ldquo;should, when reason says it ought not, oppose
            them, this I imagine&rdquo; etc. <foreign lang="greek">κοινωνήσαντα</foreign> must
            however be more than &lsquo;dealing with,&rsquo; and the aorist (which on the
            ordinary view means &lsquo;having joined,&rsquo; &lsquo;made common cause
            with&rsquo;) presents a serious difficulty in this interpretation.</p>
          <p>Reading <foreign lang="greek">ἐν ἑαντῷ</foreign>, for which there is good authority
            (see cr. n.), I formerly construed the passage as follows: &lsquo;but when
            he&rsquo; (<foreign lang="greek">αὐτόν</foreign> with reference not to <foreign lang="greek">τὸν θυμόν</foreign>, but to <foreign lang="greek">τινά</foreign> and
              <foreign lang="greek">τοῦ τοιούτου</foreign> alone) &lsquo;has joined
            partnership with his desires, because reason decides that he ought not to oppose them,
            you will not, I imagine, say that he has observed anything of the sort&rsquo; (i.e.
            such internal <foreign lang="greek">στάσις</foreign> as has just been described)
            &lsquo;ever happen in his own soul, or in the soul of another? Assuredly
            not.&rsquo; By this solution we get rid of the anacoluthon, while adopting generally
            the Scholiast's view; but it is an unnecessary and irrelevant elaboration to make Glauco
            speak of what the hypothetical person has observed in himself or in another: we wish to
            know what Glauco has himself observed.</p>
          <p>On the whole I am now inclined to believe that the traditional interpretation is
            correct. </p>

          <p>The interpretation of this sentence is very difficult, and has given rise to a vast
            amount of discussion. The only important variants are <foreign lang="greek">καὶ διὰ
              τοῦ πεινῆν καὶ διὰ τοῦ ῥιγοῦν</foreign> in <hi rend="italic">q</hi> and Flor.
            U, and <foreign lang="greek">ὑπομένων καί</foreign> (A, <foreign lang="greek">Π</foreign> etc.) instead of <foreign lang="greek">καὶ ὑπομένων</foreign>. <pb n="273"/></p>
          <p>On account of <foreign lang="greek">ὀργίζεσθαι καὶ πεινῶν καὶ ῥιγῶν καὶ ἄλλο
              ὁτιοῦν τῶν τοιούτων πάσχων</foreign> in the previous sentence, it appears to me
            certain (1) that <foreign lang="greek">καὶ διὰ τὸ πεινῆν</foreign> etc. is right as
            against <foreign lang="greek">καὶ διὰ τοῦ πεινῆν</foreign> etc., and
            (2) that these words should be construed with <foreign lang="greek">ζεῖ τε καὶ
              χαλεπαίνει</foreign>. That which in the first case was represented as the <hi rend="italic">cause</hi> of anger should be so represented in the second case also.
            The same view was held by Schneider. It is more difficult to defend <foreign lang="greek">ὑπομένων καί</foreign>, and Schneider is probably justified in
            preferring the less authoritative reading <foreign lang="greek">καὶ
            ὑπομένων</foreign>. The expression <foreign lang="greek">πάσχειν ὑπομένων</foreign>
            can hardly be a mere periphrasis for <foreign lang="greek">πάσχειν</foreign>, nor is
              <foreign lang="greek">πάσχειν ὑπομένων</foreign> altogether equivalent to <foreign lang="greek">ὑπομένειν πάσχων</foreign>, as Jowett supposes. If the best MSS are
            right in placing <foreign lang="greek">καὶ</foreign> after <foreign lang="greek">ὑπομένων</foreign>, it is possible that <foreign lang="greek">ὑπομένων</foreign>
            is corrupt, and conceals <foreign lang="greek">ὑπό</foreign> with a genitive (cf.
              <foreign lang="greek">πάσχων ὑπ’ ἐκείνου</foreign> in the parallel passage just
            before), but until the right correction has been proposed, we must adhere to the text of
              <foreign lang="greek">Ξ</foreign>.</p>
          <p>The subject of <foreign lang="greek">ζεῖ</foreign> and the other verbs is supposed by
            J. and C. to be not the man himself, but <foreign lang="greek">ὁ θυμός</foreign>. This
            is unlikely, on account of <foreign lang="greek">πεινῆν</foreign> etc., and still more
            of <foreign lang="greek">τελευτήσῃ</foreign>. The parallel with 440 C <foreign lang="greek">τοσούτῳ ἧττον δύναται ὀργίζεσθαι κτλ.</foreign> is also in favour
            of making the individual the subject.</p>
          <p>That the text of A is in the main sound I have no doubt, although I should like to read
              <foreign lang="greek">καὶ ξυμμαχεῖ τῷ δοκοῦντι δικαίῳ</foreign> after <foreign lang="greek">πάσχειν</foreign> rather than after <foreign lang="greek">χαλεπαίνει</foreign>.</p>
          <p>There is an unusually large supply of emendations. That of Madvig is peculiarly
            unhappy, though adopted by Baiter in his text, and apparently approved by Apelt
              (<title>Berl. Philol. Wochenschr.</title> 1895 p. 968): <foreign lang="greek">καὶ δἰ
              αὐτὸ πεινῆν καὶ δἰ αὐτὸ ῥιγοῦν καὶ πάντα τὰ τοιαῦτα πάσχειν ὑπομένων,
              κἂν νικᾶται, οὐ λήγει κτλ.</foreign> The other proposals are enumerated by
            Hartman. They are as follows: <foreign lang="greek">καὶ διὰ τὸ πεινῆν καὶ διὰ
              τὸ πάσχειν καὶ ὑπομένει νικᾶν καὶ οὐ λήγει κτλ.</foreign> (Ast):
              <foreign lang="greek">καὶ δἰ αὐτὸ πεινῆν καὶ δἰ αὐτὸπάσχειν
              ὑπομένων διανεκῆ οὐ λήγει κτλ.</foreign> (H. Sauppe, quoted by Hartman): <foreign lang="greek">καὶ διὰ τοῦ πεινῆν καὶ διὰ τοῦπάσχων ὑπομένειν
              νικᾷ καὶ κτλ.</foreign> (Liebhold): <foreign lang="greek">καὶ διὰ τοῦ πεινῆν
              καὶ διὰ τοῦ κτλ.</foreign> (Campbell, who in other respects acquiesces in the text
            of A): <foreign lang="greek">καὶ διὰ τοῦ πεινῆν καὶ διὰ
            τοῦὑπομένων</foreign> [<foreign lang="greek">καὶ</foreign>] <foreign lang="greek">νικᾶν</foreign> [<foreign lang="greek">καὶ</foreign>] <foreign lang="greek">οὐ λήγει κτλ.</foreign> (Hartman). Richards apparently accepts the
            suggestion of Madvig as far as it goes, but thinks that <foreign lang="greek">τῶν
              γενναίων</foreign> &lsquo;is most feeble. Plainly Plato wrote <foreign lang="greek">οὐ λήγει ἀγανακτῶν</foreign>, possibly with some additional word
            before <foreign lang="greek">ἀγανακτῶν</foreign>&rsquo; (<title>Cl. Rev.</title>
            VII p. 254). The reading printed above is not only more authoritative but also in my
            judgment infinitely better than any of these rash and unjustifiable alterations. <pb n="274"/>

          <p>449A - 451C Socrates is about to describe the different kinds of depraved polities,
            when Adimantus, prompted by Polemarchus, and supported by Glauco and Thrasymachus,
            demands from him a fuller explanation of the community of wives and children, and of the
            arrangements for begetting and rearing offspring. Socrates professes reluctance, both
            because it will be doubted whether his scheme is either practicable or expedient, and
            because he is himself uncertain of his ground and unwilling to involve his friends in
            possible discomfiture. At last, after propitiating Nemesis, and being exonerated by his
            friends, he proceeds to comply with their request.</p>
          <p>ff. Considered in its merely formal aspect, the portion of the <title>Republic</title>
            contained in Books V&mdash;VII may be described as a digression (<foreign lang="greek">ἀναμνησθῶμεν πόθεν δεῦρο ἐξετραπόμεθα</foreign> VIII 543 C). In
            reality, these books fulfil the hopes held out in sundry parts of III and IV (see III
            414 A, 416 B, IV 423 E, 435 D, 439 E, 442 C notes), and complete the picture of the
            perfect city and the perfect man by giving us Plato's third or crowning effort
            &mdash;the philosophic City and the Philosopher-King. See on II 372 D. As we often
            find in Plato (see e.g. <bibl n="Plat. Phaedo 84C"><title>Phaed.</title> 84 C</bibl>
            ff.), the new departure is occasioned by an objection, or rather a request for further
            information, on the part of one of the interlocutors. Adimantus invites Socrates to
            explain the remark made by him in IV 423 E f. and fully expound the principle of
              <foreign lang="greek">κοινὰ τὰ φίλων</foreign> as it affects women and children.
            The challenge is accepted, and Socrates deals with the question under three main heads,
            which he figures as waves through which the argument must swim in safety. The first wave
            concerns Community of Education between the male and female Guardians (451 C&mdash;
            457 B); the second, Community in wives and children (457 B&mdash;466 D); the third
            and greatest, whose advent is long delayed, deals with the question whether Communism
            and therewithal the perfect city itself can be realised in the world (471 C ff.). The
            last of these three waves is not finally surmounted until the description of the
            Philosopher and his City reaches its conclusion at the end of VII: so that Books
            V&mdash;VII closely cohere together. In the first two divisions (V 451
            C&mdash;466 D), the dominating principle is still <foreign lang="greek">φύσις</foreign> or Nature (see on 451 C): but from 474 D onwards the psychological
            standpoint is gradually superseded by the metaphysical, until in Book VII the Idea of
            Good becomes the supreme inspiring force&mdash;at once the formal, the efficient,
            and the final cause&mdash;of Plato's City. See on VI 506 E, 509 B ff. On the alleged
            connexion between the earlier part of Book V (451 C&mdash;466 D) and the

            said of those who neglect their proper duty for some more fascinating&mdash; if less
            profitable&mdash;pursuit. Cf. Harpocr. s.v. <foreign lang="greek">χρυσοχοεῖον</foreign>: <foreign lang="greek">Δείναρχος ἐν τῷ κατὰ Πυθέου·
              πάλιν παρ’ Αἰσχίνην ἀποφοιτήσας παρὰ τούτῳ δῆλον ὅτι χρυσοχοεῖν

            having been discovered on Hymettus, the Athenian populace deserted their usual
            avocations, and sallied out to seize it. But as it was guarded <foreign lang="greek">ὑπὸ τῶν μαχίμων μυκτήρων</foreign> (cf. Hdt. III 102 ff. with the parallels

            reasons) Thrasymachus and Socrates are now reconciled. Ast's explanation
            &ldquo;aurum fundere proverbialiter dicitur, quem magna, quam animo conceperat, spes
            frustratur&rdquo; expresses only one side of the proverb: the
            other&mdash;neglecting the duty which lies nearest&mdash;is more important and
            relevant here. &ldquo;To find an Eldorado&rdquo; (Warren) may perhaps meet the
            case. Thomas Gray's explanation is not altogether right: &ldquo;a proverbial

            theology (Abel <title>Orph. Fr.</title> 36, 109&mdash;111) and appears in <bibl n="Plat. Phaedrus 248C"><title>Phaedr.</title> 248 C</bibl>. Specifically, she was
            viewed as a variety of Nemesis, <foreign lang="greek">θεά τις τοὺς ὑπερηφάνους
              τιμωροῦσα</foreign> (Schol. on <bibl n="Aesch. PB 936">Aesch. <title>Prom.</title>

            Greek literature). Adrasteia is in a still more special sense the punisher of proud
            words; so that <foreign lang="greek">προσκυνῶ Ἀδράστειαν</foreign> becomes, as here,
            a sort of apologetic preface to a bold assertion or rash utterance: cf. <bibl n="Eur. Rh. 342">Eur. <title>Rhes.</title> 342</bibl>, 468 (<foreign lang="greek">ξὺν δ’ Ἀδραστείᾳ λέγω</foreign>). See N&auml;gelsbach <title>Nachhom.

I can find no parallel to its omission with <foreign lang="greek">ἐλπίζω</foreign>, but <foreign lang="greek">οἴομαι,

            explanation gives a good sense, but it is harsh to separate <foreign lang="greek">δικαίων</foreign> from <foreign lang="greek">νομίμων</foreign>, and still harsher
            to take <foreign lang="greek">καλῶν</foreign> as equivalent to <foreign lang="greek">περὶ καλῶν</foreign>. Schneider was inclined to treat <foreign lang="greek">δικαίων</foreign> as a gloss on <foreign lang="greek">νομίμων</foreign>. But
            &lsquo;about things beautiful and good and institutions&rsquo; is an
            anti-climax; and, besides, it is of institutions in conjunction with, not as distinct

              <foreign lang="greek">εὖ</foreign> is ironical. Glauco had comforted Socrates by

            says Socrates: I had rather, in the circumstances, that they were enemies! Stallbaum and

            misplaced; but Glauco's smile (<foreign lang="greek">γελάσας</foreign>) <pb n="279"/>
            favours the ironical interpretation, and so does the &lsquo;Socratic
            irony&rsquo; with which the whole sentence is overflowing. I agree with J. and C. in
            rejecting the pointless alternative rendering &lsquo;you do well to comfort

            playful allusion to the mimes of Sophron, as was first pointed out by R.
            F&ouml;rster in <title>Rhein. Mus.</title> XXX (1875) p. 316. According to Suidas
            (s.v. <foreign lang="greek">Σώφρων</foreign>) and others, Sophron's mimes were
            classified as <foreign lang="greek">ἀνδρεῖοι μῖμοι</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">γυναικεῖοι μῖμοι</foreign>. In the former, as may be inferred from
            Choricius' <title>Defence of Mimes</title> (first published by Graux in <title>Revue de
              Philologie</title> 1 pp. 209 ff.) Sophron represented male characters, in the latter
            female (<foreign lang="greek">μιμεῖται μὲν ἄνδρας, μιμεῖται δὲ γύναια</foreign>
            ib. p. 215). This is corroborated by many of the titles of his plays, such as <foreign lang="greek">ὁ ἀγροιώτας, ὁ θυνναθήρας, ὁ ἄγγελος</foreign> contrasted with
              <foreign lang="greek">ταὶ ἀκ&lt;&gt;στρίαι, ἁ νυμφόπονος, ἁ
            πενθερά</foreign> etc. Sophron's mimes are called <foreign lang="greek">δράματα</foreign> (cf. <foreign lang="greek">ἀνδρεῖον δρᾶμα</foreign>) by Demetrius
              <foreign lang="greek">περὶ ἑρμηνείας</foreign> &sect; 156 <foreign lang="greek">σχεδόν τε πάσας ἐκ τῶν δραμάτων αὐτοῦ τὰς παροιμίας ἐκλέξαι
            ἐστίν</foreign>. The point here is that just as custom required an <foreign lang="greek">ἀνδρεῖος μῖμος</foreign> to precede a <foreign lang="greek">γυναικεῖος</foreign>&mdash;this is not otherwise attested, so far as I can
            discover&mdash;, so it will be proper (<foreign lang="greek">ὀρθῶς ἂν
            ἔχοι</foreign>) for Plato's women to come on the stage after his men have played their
            part. Plato's partiality for Sophron is frequently mentioned by ancient authors, as for
            example by D. L. III 18, Quintil. I 10. 17: see Schuster in <title>Rhein. Mus.</title>
            XXIX (1874) pp. 605 ff., where these and other authorities are cited. Susemihl
            (Bursian's <title>Jahresbericht</title> 1874&mdash;1875 III p. 343) doubted whether
            Plato has Sophron in view here; but the allusion, which was admitted by Graux (l.c. p.
            215 note), and successfully reaffirmed by F&ouml;rster (<title>Rhein. Mus.</title>
            for 1880 p. 472), is highly probable. I can see no point in making <foreign lang="greek">δρᾶμα γυναικεῖον</foreign> an ironical reference to the
            <title>Ecclesiazusae</title> of Aristophanes (with Munk <hi rend="italic">die nat.
              Ordnung d. Pl. Schr.</hi> p. 296, and Chiappelli l.c. p. 196), nor is it likely that
            the words allude to a dramatic caricature of Plato's policy by some other comedian, as
            is supposed by Bergk <title>Gr. Literaturgesch.</title> IV p. 462 note 134. On Sophron's

          <p>451C - 452E We declared at the <pb n="280"/> outset that our men were to be as it were
            guardians of the flock. Now the principle of community requires that our female
            watch-dogs shall share the active duties of the males, allowance being made for their
            inferiority in strength. Their education must therefore be the same: they will have to
            learn music, gymnastic, and the art of war. No doubt the spectacle of women, especially
            old women, exercising themselves naked along with men, will seem ludicrous at first; but
            it is not long since the Greeks would have thought it ludicrous even for men to strip
            for athletic exercises. Nothing is truly ludicrous except what is mischievous.</p>
          <p>ff. Socrates now prepares to encounter the first &lsquo;wave&rsquo; (451
            C&mdash;457 B): see on 449 A ff. The outstanding feature in his argument throughout
            this part of the dialogue is the constant appeal which he makes to <foreign lang="greek">φύσις</foreign> (452 E, 453 B, C, E, 454 B, C, D, 455 A, D, E, 456 A, B, C, D). He
            maintains that community of work and education between certain selected men and women is
            &lsquo;natural&rsquo; in two senses. In the first place, it is, he maintains, in
            harmony with <hi rend="italic">human</hi> nature, that is, with the nature of man and
            woman (455 E ff.), and in the second place, it is recommended by the analogy of Nature's
            other children, the lower animals (451 D). See also on II 370 A. P&ouml;hlmann
              (<title>Gesch. d. antik. Kommunismus</title> etc. pp. 114&mdash;146) has shewn
            that the desire for a &lsquo;return to Nature&rsquo; found frequent and manifold
            expression in the literature of Plato's times, and we can see that Plato was himself
            powerfully affected by the same impulse, although his interpretation of
            &lsquo;Nature&rsquo; is coloured by an Idealism which is peculiarly his own (IV
            443 B note). The special regulations of Book V may be illustrated in some particulars
            from the practices of certain &lsquo;Natur-v&ouml;lker&rsquo; before the
            time of Plato (see e.g. Hdt. IV 116 and infra 463 C note), as well as by certain
            features of the Pythagorean and Spartan disciplines (see RP.^{7} 48 A f. and notes on
            452 B al.), but it is more important and relevant to observe that Plato's assignment of
            common duties and common training to the two sexes is part of a well-reasoned and
            deliberate attempt by the Socratic school to improve the position of women in Greece. In
            this respect, as in many others, the teaching of Socrates inaugurated an era of protest
            against the old Hellenic view of things. See in particular, for the views of Socrates
            himself, <bibl n="Xen. Mem. 2.2.5">Xen. <title>Mem.</title> II 2. 5</bibl>,
            <title>Symp.</title> 2. 9 <foreign lang="greek">ἡ γυναικεία φύσις οὐδὲν χείρων

            E ff.; and for the opinion of Antisthenes consult D. L. VI 12 <foreign lang="greek">ἀνδρὸς καὶ γυναικὸς ἡ αὐτὴ ἀρετή</foreign>. It is possible that some of
            Euripides' pictures of noble and disinterested women were also inspired in some measure
            by the influence of the same movement. In later times the Stoics constituted themselves
            the champions of similar views, and Cleanthes wrote a treatise entitled <foreign lang="greek">περὶ τοῦ ὅτι ἡ αὐτὴ ἀρετὴ καὶ ἀνδρὸς καὶ
            γυναικός</foreign>: see Dyroff <title>Ethik d. alten Stoa</title> pp. 311
            &mdash;314, where other evidence is cited. A learned and acute discussion on the
            attitude of the Socratic school in this matter will be found in Chiappelli <title>Riv.
              di Filologia</title> etc. XI pp. 229 ff. Finally it should be observed that, from
            Plato's point of view, the selection of suitable women as <foreign lang="greek">φύλακες</foreign> is strictly in harmony with the fundamental principle of our city,
            viz. &lsquo;to each one work according to his or her nature&rsquo; (II 370 B
            note); that it removes a dangerous source of unrest, intrigue, and sedition, by
            providing an outlet for the energies of able and politically-minded women in legitimate
            channels and silencing them with the responsibilities of rule, while it at the same time
            secures for the service of the State all that is best in the other half of the
            population (<title>Laws</title> 781 A), and justifies the claim of the perfect city to
            be in literal truth an Aristocracy.</p>

              (<foreign lang="greek">ἄλλο, τὸ δὲ ἄλλο</foreign>): cf. infra 455 E. This

            he regards <foreign lang="greek">οἰκονομία</foreign> as <foreign lang="greek">παρὰ

            Richards conjectures <foreign lang="greek">μήν</foreign>, which would certainly be more

            If &mdash;with the majority of modern critics&mdash; we hold that the

            least in some measure directed against theories on communism and the position of women
            with which the Socratic school sympathised, it is easy to interpret Plato here as
            addressing a rebuke to the comic stage in the form of a further challenge. In any case,
            however, the words <foreign lang="greek">οὐ φοβητέονὀχήσεις</foreign> are

          <p>452E - 456C Let us first determine whether our proposal is possible&mdash;in other
            words, whether woman is naturally able to share the duties of man&mdash;all, or
            none, or some, and, if some, whether war is one of these. It may be argued:
            &lsquo;man's nature is different from that of woman: we should therefore assign them
            different duties.&rsquo; A little analysis will shew the superficial and eristic
            character of such reasoning. The word &lsquo;different&rsquo; is ambiguous.
            Natures may differ without differing at all in respect of the powers by which certain
            duties are performed. Consequently, if man and woman differ only in sex, they may each
            perform those duties in which sex plays no part. Among such duties are those which
            appertain to the administration of a city. Doubtless man is superior, as a whole, in
            capacity and strength, although many women excel many men; but the natural aptitudes of
            individual women are as various as those of men, and there is no administrative duty
            which is by Nature exclusively appropriated either to men, or to women. Thus Nature
            produces women who are fitted to guard our city. These we shall select as the wives and
            colleagues of the male guardians. Our proposal is possible, because it is natural: the

            been defended in two ways. Schneider prints a colon after <foreign lang="greek">ἔφη</foreign>, and explains <foreign lang="greek">οὐ μὰ τὸν Δία</foreign> as
            &ldquo;minime, per Jovem, &lt;temere tu et sine causa hanc rem tractare
            dubitabas&gt;&rdquo;; but it is exceedingly difficult to supply the words in
            brackets. This difficulty induced Apelt (<title>Obs. Crit.</title> p. 12) to suggest
              <foreign lang="greek">οὐ &lt;μάτην&gt; μὰ τὸν Δία, ἔφη· οὐ γὰρ
            κτλ.</foreign> Others explain the oath as emphasizing <foreign lang="greek">οὐ γὰρ
              εὐκόλῳ ἔοικεν</foreign>, and compare X 605 E <foreign lang="greek">οὐ μὰ τὸν
              Δί̓, ἔφη, οὐκ εὐλόγῳ ἔοικεν</foreign> and <bibl n="Plat. Parm. 131E"><title>Parm.</title> 131 E</bibl>
            <foreign lang="greek">οὐ μὰ τὸν Δία, φάναι, οὔ μοι δοκεῖ εὔκολον εἶναι τὸ

            absent from each of these passages. Hartman strangely explains <foreign lang="greek">γάρ</foreign> as &lsquo;profecto&rsquo;; while Stallbaum inclines to cut it
            out. Groen van Prinsterer (<title>Prosop. Plat.</title> p. 209) proposed to read
              <foreign lang="greek">οὐ γὰρ εὐκόλῳ ἔοικεν. Οὐ μὰ τὸν Δία, ἔφη. Οὐ
              γάρ, εἶπον</foreign>. It appears to me that the emphatic <foreign lang="greek">οὐ
              μὰ τὸν Δία</foreign> is more appropriate in the mouth of Socrates, who is
            continually dwelling on the difficulty of his task, and I therefore think that Plato
            wrote <foreign lang="greek">Οὐ γὰρ εὐκόλῳ ἔοικεν, ἔφη. Οὐ γάρ, εἶπον, οὐ
              μὰ τὸν Δία</foreign>, although I have not ventured to change the text. <foreign lang="greek">εὐκόλῳ</foreign> is of course neuter, not masculine, as Richter
            supposed (<title>Fl. Jahrb.</title> 1867 p. 143).</p>

          <p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ἄπορον</lemma>. As <foreign lang="greek">ἄλλην</foreign> here means &lsquo;other&rsquo; and not

            (&lsquo;difficult to procure,&rsquo; cf. II 378 A) must be applicable to the
            dolphin also. The Platonic <hi rend="italic">litotes</hi> seems delicately to suggest
            that the miraculous story of Arion and the dolphin is not above suspicion. Herwerden
            conjectured <foreign lang="greek">ἄτοπον</foreign>, but no change is necessary.</p>

          <p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">τὸ μὴ τὴν αὐτὴν κτλ.</lemma> See cr. n. The

            attack.&rsquo; In reality, it means &lsquo;we are pursuing&rsquo; (the
            proposition that), i.e. &lsquo;we are insisting that.&rsquo; The way for this
            somewhat strained use is prepared by <foreign lang="greek">διώκειν τὴν
            ἐναντίωσιν</foreign> just above. Plato is in fact applying the expression <foreign lang="greek">τοῦ λεχθέντος τὴν ἐναντίωσιν</foreign> to the special case before
            us. <foreign lang="greek">τὸ λεχθέν</foreign> would in this case be that

I prefer the former, both because it has some
            MS authority, and also because, if Plato had chosen to use <foreign lang="greek">ἄλλος</foreign>, he would probably have written <foreign lang="greek">τὰς ἄλλας
              φύσεις</foreign> as in 453 E. It is also true, as J. and C. observe, that
            &ldquo;the opposition of <foreign lang="greek">μὴ τὴν αὐτήν, οὐ τῶν

          <p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ἰατρικὸν κτλ.</lemma> Plato is illustrating that
            particular variety of <foreign lang="greek">ὁμοίωσις</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">ἀλλοίωσις</foreign> which <foreign lang="greek">πρὸς αὐτὰ τείνει
              τὰ ἐπιτηδεύματα</foreign>. As an instance of <foreign lang="greek">ὁμοίωσις</foreign> he gives two <foreign lang="greek">ἰατρικοί</foreign> (cf. I 350
            A): these clearly have the same nature <foreign lang="greek">πρὸς αὐτὰ τὰ
              ἐπιτηδεύματα</foreign>, i.e. in this case <foreign lang="greek">πρὸς τὸ
              ἰατρεύεσθαι. ἀλλοίωσις</foreign> he illustrates by the difference between an
              <foreign lang="greek">ἰατρικός</foreign> and a <foreign lang="greek">τεκτονικός</foreign>: these have different natures <foreign lang="greek">πρὸς τὰ
              ἐπιτηδεύματα</foreign>, for the one is qualified <foreign lang="greek">ἰατρεύεσθαι</foreign>, the other <foreign lang="greek">τεκταίνεσθαι</foreign>.
            Nothing could be more clear; but the text has been plunged into confusion by the
            introduction of the words <foreign lang="greek">τὴν ψυχὴν ὄντα</foreign> after the
            second <foreign lang="greek">ἰατρικόν</foreign>. The reading of A&mdash;see cr.
            n.&mdash;is indefensible; and the majority of recent editors print <foreign lang="greek">ἰατρικὸν μὲν καὶ ἰατρικὸν τὴν ψυχὴν ὄντα</foreign> with <hi rend="italic">q.</hi> But <foreign lang="greek">τὴν ψυχὴν ὄντα</foreign> adds
            nothing to <foreign lang="greek">ἰατρικόν</foreign>. It has indeed been thought that
              <foreign lang="greek">ἰατρικόν</foreign> by itself suggests a doctor in actual
            practice, whereas an <foreign lang="greek">ἰατρικὸς τὴν ψυχήν</foreign> need not
            practise. If so, we may fairly doubt whether the two have the same nature; and at all
            events the difference between them renders them inapt illustrations of Plato's argument.
            Jowett and Campbell attempt to escape these difficulties by taking <foreign lang="greek">τὴν ψυχὴν ὄντα</foreign> with the first <foreign lang="greek">ἰατρικόν</foreign> as well as with the second; but the Greek does not permit of this
            solution. Similar objections apply to the readings of Bekker (and apparently Ficinus)
              <foreign lang="greek">ἰατρὸν μὲν καὶ ἰατρικὸν τὴν ψυχὴν ὄντα</foreign>, of
            Stephanus and other early editors <foreign lang="greek">ἰατρικὸν μὲν καὶ ἰατρικὴν
              τὴν ψυχὴν ἔχοντα</foreign> (partly supported by <foreign lang="greek">Θ</foreign>), and also, with some modifications, to Richards' otherwise unhappy

            premature. I regard <foreign lang="greek">τὴν ψυχὴν ὄντα</foreign> as a relic of
              <foreign lang="greek">ἰατρὸν τὴν ψυχὴν ὄντα</foreign>, a marginal annotation on

          <p>456C - 457B It remains to prove that our policy is the best for the State. We are
            agreed that the training which qualifies a man to be a guardian will qualify a woman
            also, if their natural capacities are the same to start with. Now our male guardians,
            owing to their education, are the best men in the city. Our female guardians will in
            like manner be the best women. And there is nothing better for a city than to be peopled
            by the best women and the best men. This end is secured by our system of education.
            Therefore our women must strip for athletic exercises, and share all the labours of
            guardianship, in spite of the foolish laughter of those who forget that utility is the
            true standard of good taste. <pb n="291"/></p>

              καρπόν</foreign>, where <foreign lang="greek">σοφίας</foreign> is a defining
            genitive, denoting not the tree, but the fruit. Pindar means that their <foreign lang="greek">σοφία</foreign> is <foreign lang="greek">ἀτελής</foreign> or
            inconsummatc&mdash;misses its mark &mdash;is no real <foreign lang="greek">σοφία</foreign> at all. <title>More suo</title> Plato adapts the Pindaric fragment
            to his own purpose. The object of his attack is Comedy, and Comedy cultivates, not
              <foreign lang="greek">σοφία</foreign>, but <foreign lang="greek">τὸ
            γελοῖον</foreign>. Hence&mdash;according to the reading of the text&mdash;Plato

              <foreign lang="greek">οὐδὲν οἶδενἐφ’ ψ̔͂ γελᾷ οὐδ’ ὅ τι
            πράττει</foreign>. Cf. 452 D <foreign lang="greek">μάταιος ὃς γελοῖον ἄλλο τι
              ἡγεῖται ἢ τὸ κακόν</foreign>. This interpretation assumes that <foreign lang="greek">σοφίας</foreign> in Plato is a gloss interpolated to complete the
            quotation. See cr. n. and App. III.</p>
          <p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">κάλλιστα κτλ.</lemma> The doctrine of this famous
            sentence, which sounds like a manifesto, and was characteristically selected by Grote as
            one of the mottoes to his <title>Plato</title>, is essentially Socratic: see especially
              <bibl n="Xen. Mem. 4.6.8">Xen. <title>Mem.</title> IV 6. 8</bibl>, 9 and other
            passages quoted by Zeller^{4} II 1. pp. 149&mdash;153. Utilitarianism of this kind
            pervades the <title>Republic</title>, as Krohn has amply proved (<title>Pl. St.</title>
            p. 370), and asserts itself even in the highest flights of Plato's idealism (<foreign lang="greek">ἡ τοῦ ἀγαθοῦ ἰδέαᾗ δίκαια καὶ τἄλλα
              προσχρησάμενα χρήσιμα καὶ ὠφέλιμα γίγνεται</foreign> VI 505 A). But even
            Socrates ennobles his utilitarianism by placing soul far above body in dignity and
            worth. In Plato utilitarianism becomes transfigured by Idealism and the doctrine of
            Immortality. Here it should be noted that <foreign lang="greek">καλόν</foreign>
            <pb n="292"/> combines, as often, the ideas of artistic fitness or propriety, and
            propriety of conduct. The moral sense of the Greeks lay in their appreciation of the
            beautiful.</p>
          <p>457B - 458B Thus do we successfully evade one of the waves which threatened us, but a
            more formidable wave is now approaching. The women and children are to belong to all the
            guardians in common. No one shall know his father or his child. That such a state of
            society is both possible and beneficial, we shall have to prove; but for the present, we
            will assume its possibility, and try to shew that community of wives and children is the
            best of all policies for the city and its guardians.</p>
          <p>ff. We now confront the second wave (see 449 A ff. note). The Platonic doctrine of
            community in wives and children, as a certain critic drily remarks, has been more often
            censured than understood. The object of the present note is not to sit in judgment upon
            Plato, but to endeavour to explain his attitude on this subject. In its general aspect,
            the theory should be regarded as an extreme development of the Naturalism prevailing in
            Books II&mdash;IV: see on II 370 A f. and supra 451 C ff. Several precedents have
            been cited from the institutions of various primitive peoples who were sometimes
            regarded by the Greeks as types of &lsquo;natural&rsquo; societies, as for
            example the Scythians (see on 463 C and other references in P&ouml;hlmann
              <title>Gesch. d. antik. Kommunismus etc.</title> pp. 121 ff., with Newman's
              <title>Politics of Aristotle</title> Vol. II p. 282 and especially Riese's interesting
            tract on <hi rend="italic">Die Idealisirung der Naturv&ouml;lker d. Nordens in d.
              gr. u. r&ouml;m. Literatur</hi> 1875), and even Sparta, a State which was
            constantly extolled by Greek political theorists as a model of the <foreign lang="greek">κατὰ φύσιν οἰκισθεῖσα πόλις</foreign> (P&ouml;hlmann l.c. pp. 125 ff., Grote
              <title>Plato</title> III p. 209 f.), furnished some parallels to the Platonic
            communism in this respect (Plut. <title>Lyc.</title> 15. 9&mdash;11, Xen.
              <title>Rep. Lac.</title> 1. 8, 9). But Plato's real motive in advocating his theory is
            simply and solely the good of the commonwealth (462 A). On the one hand, he dreaded the
            effect of domestic ties in encouraging selfishness and weakening the bonds of civic
            obligation; and, with his customary disregard of the limitations of ordinary human
            nature, he expected his citizens to transfer the domestic affections, without
            surrendering aught of their intensity, from the family to the State. We may therefore
            truly say that Plato's intention was not to abolish the family, but rather to enlarge
            its borders and make it coincident with the State. &ldquo;Die
            Sonderfamilie,&rdquo; as Nohle remarks (<hi rend="italic">die Statslehre Platos</hi>
            etc. p. 133), &ldquo;wird nur aufgehoben, damit das Ganze eine grosse Familie
            sei.&rdquo; On the other hand, he was profoundly impressed with the necessity of
            restricting the population, and at the same time maintaining and improving the breed of
            guardians, and the measures which he here prescribes are to a large extent devised with
            a view to securing these ends (459 A&mdash;461 E). In this respect Plato might
            fairly hope that his proposals would not be abhorrent to a nation whose idea of marriage
            was primarily only a legalised union for the procreation of legitimate children. It may
            be argued that Plato sacrifices more than he gains, even if we judge him from the
            standpoint of his own political idealism, but it shews a complete misapprehension of the
            situation to charge him with deliberate encouragement of vice: the community of wives
            and children &ldquo;hat mit &lsquo;freier Liebe&rsquo; nichts zu
            thun&rdquo; (P&ouml;hlmann l.c. p. 280). Finally, we should remember that it is
            only the Guardians and Auxiliaries who are subject to these rules (see on III 417 A),
            and that in the second-best city depicted in the <title>Laws</title> Plato revives the
            institution of marriage, as we understand the word, without, however, surrendering in
            the smallest degree his earlier ideal (807 B). Perhaps the wisest and most temperate
            discussion on Plato's conception of marriage and the family is that of Grote
              (<title>Plato</title> III pp. 220 &mdash;234). Some judicious remarks will also be
            found in Jowett <title>Introduction</title> pp. clxxxi&mdash;cxciv, and Nettleship
              <title>Lectures and Remains</title> II pp. 174&mdash;180: but Jowett goes beyond
            the province of the interpreter, and lays too much stress on the antagonism between the
            views of Plato and those of modern civilised communities. See also on 458 E and App. I

          <p>458B - 461E The mutual association of male and female guardians will naturally lead
            them to form conjugal ties. But no irregular unions will be permitted. We too shall have
            our &lsquo;holy wedlocks,&rsquo; but by &lsquo;holy&rsquo; we shall mean
            &lsquo;profitable&rsquo; or &lsquo;beneficial.&rsquo; Now the most
            beneficial unions among lower animals are those by which the best offspring is produced
            from parents in the prime of life. If the same is true of the human race, how skilful
            must our rulers be! They must unite the best couples as frequently, the worst as rarely
            as possible; and only the children of the best couples shall be reared. No one except
            the archons is to know how this result is attained. Bridegrooms and brides will be
            brought together at certain marriage festivals, accompanied with sacrifice and song; and
            the number of marriages will be settled on each occasion by the rulers, so as to keep
            the population as far as possible the same. The rulers will effect their object by using
            lots with which they have already tampered. They will also reward excellence in fighting
            and otherwise by more liberal intercourse with women. The children who are to be reared
            will be taken to an establishment of nurses, where the mothers, and other women, will
            come to suckle them, but every precaution will be taken to prevent the mothers from
            recognising their offspring. Woman is in her prime from twenty to forty, man from
            twenty-five to fifty-five, and it is only during these periods that we shall permit them
            to bear and beget children for the State. Violations of this rule will be severely
            condemned. After the prescribed <pb n="295"/> age has been passed, we shall remove the
            restrictions on sexual intercourse, observing only such regulations as are necessary to
            prevent incest; but, if possible, these unofficial unions shall be barren, and, in any
            case, their offspring must not be reared. Socrates lays down some further regulations
            about new meanings to be attached to names of family relationships, and adds that
            &lsquo;brothers&rsquo; and &lsquo;sisters&rsquo; may marry, with the
            sanction of the lot and the Pythian priestess's approval.</p>

            may also, as Jackson suggests, have influenced Plato's choice of construction in this

              οἰκίαν</foreign>. The nuptials of Zeus and Hera were known as the <foreign lang="greek">Θεογαμία</foreign>, or <foreign lang="greek">ἱερὸς γάμος</foreign>,
            and were celebrated by a special festival in Athens and elsewhere: see H. Graillot's
            article on <foreign lang="greek">ἱερὸς γάμος</foreign> in Daremberg and Saglio's
            dictionary, where the authorities are cited, or Farnell's <title>Cults of the Greek
              States</title> I pp. 184&mdash;192. To Greek religious sentiment the marriage of
            Zeus and Hera was (as Graillot says) the ideal type of all human marriages, and for this
            reason Plato characteristically applies the expression <foreign lang="greek">ἱερὸς
              γάμος</foreign> to his ideal of marriage in his ideal city. Cf. also Proclus <hi rend="italic">in Tim.</hi> 16 B <foreign lang="greek">τῶν ἐν ἀπορρήτοις λεγομένων
              ἱερῶν γάμων, οἶς καὶ ὁ Πλάτων εἰς δύναμιν ἐξομοιῶν περὶ τοὺς πολίτας

              <title>Orphic.</title> p. 243. It is clear from Plato's words that he would have
            repudiated with scorn the charge of seeking to abolish marriage. We have already seen
            that he endeavours to make the State into one vast family (457 B note); and it is in the
            same spirit that he now tries to raise marriage from a private into a public
            institution, without sacrificing any of the religious ceremonies and associations by
            which the union of the sexes was hallowed in the eyes of his contemporaries: cf. 459 E.
            If his vaulting idealism &ldquo;o'erleaps itself and falls on the other,&rdquo;
            that is no reason why we should impugn his motives, or refuse our homage to his
            unquenchable faith in the possibilities of human nature.</p>

              <foreign lang="greek">καίπερ φαυλότερον ὄντα</foreign>, or else suppose that

            explanation is simple or natural; and Stephanus, Madvig, and others have in my judgment
            some reason for expunging <foreign lang="greek">εἶναι</foreign>, although its
            intrusion is not altogether easy to explain. It is possible enough that Plato wrote

            ἰατροῦ</foreign> in line 19 (cf. <foreign lang="greek">δεῖ ἄκρων εἶναι τῶν
              ἀρχόντων</foreign> in B above); and the possibility is raised, I think, into a

            sometimes at 30 (721 A, 785 B). By thirty-five he expected them to be married (ib.).
            Girls are to marry between 16 (785 B) or 18 (833 D) and 20 (ib.). Cf. Hesiod

            These phrases express concisely the Platonic view of marriage. They are equally
            applicable to the Spartan ideal, and may have been borrowed from Sparta. Cf. Plut.
              <title>Pyrrh.</title> 28. 5 <foreign lang="greek">τῶν δὲ πρεσβυτέρων τινὲς
              ἐπηκολούθουν βοῶντες· Οἷχε, Ἀκρότατε, καὶ οἷφε τὰν Χιλωνίδα· μόνον
              παῖδας ἀγαθοὺς τᾷ Σπάρτᾳ ποίει</foreign>. &ldquo;What Lucan observes
            about Cato of Utica, is applicable to the Guardians of the Platonic Republic:
            &mdash; Venerisque huic maximus usus &verbar; progenies: Urbi pater est, Urbique
            maritus&rdquo; (<title>Phars.</title> II 387 f.) Grote.</p>
          <p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ἐπειδὰν -- ἀκμήν</lemma>: &lsquo;when he has
            outlived his swiftest prime of running.&rsquo; The expression <foreign lang="greek">ὀξυτατην δρόμου ἀκμήν</foreign> is doubtless borrowed from some epinikian poet,
            perhaps Bacchylides or Pindar. The dactylic rhythm is not in itself enough to justify us
            in assigning the phrase (with Herwerden) to epic or elegy. The author of the quotation
            was probably speaking not of a man, but of a race-horse. By applying the phrase (of
            course in a metaphorical sense) to his bridegrooms, Plato contrives again to suggest the
            now familiar analogy of a &lsquo;breeding-stud of horses and mares&rsquo;: see
            on 460 C. The comparison gains in realism and point, if it was the custom of antiquity,
            as it is now, to bring a first-rate racer to the stud (<foreign lang="greek">ἱπποφόρβιον, ἱπποτροφεῖον</foreign>) when he ceased to run. This is probable in
            itself, and supported to some extent by a comparison of Plut. <title>Lyc.</title> 15. 12
              <foreign lang="greek">ἵππους ὑπὸ τοῖς κρατίστοις τῶν ὀχείων βιβάζουσι,

            <title>Georg.</title> 3. 209&mdash;211. Just so Plato will not allow his guardians
            to marry until the fever in the blood has somewhat cooled: cf. <title>Laws</title> 775
            B&mdash;776 B and J. B. Mayor in <title>Cl. Rev.</title> X p. 111. Stallbaum was the
            first to detect the poetical quotation. J. and C., though translating by &ldquo;his
            swiftest prime of running,&rdquo; follow Schleiermacher in understanding the phrase
            literally; but we may fairly doubt if Greek runners had passed their prime at 25, and,
            even if they had, &ldquo;non hic erat tali designationi locus, nisi forte ob id
            ipsum, quod cursui minus idonei forent, ad nuptias idoneos visos credimus&rdquo;
            (Schneider). <foreign lang="greek">παρῇ</foreign> means &lsquo;let go
            by,&rsquo; &ldquo;hinter sich hat&rdquo; (Schneider): cf. such expressions
            as <foreign lang="greek">παριέναι καιρόν</foreign> (II 370 B al.), <foreign lang="greek">νύκτα μέσην παρέντες</foreign> (Hdt. VIII 9), and especially <bibl n="Soph. OC 1230">Soph. <title>O. C.</title> 1230</bibl>

            in practice common enough: see Bl&uuml;mner <title>Privatalt.</title> p. 76. Plato
            permits it also in the <title>Laws</title> (740 D). The general Greek sentiment on this

              <foreign lang="greek">θάπτειν</foreign> (as in 469 A), but Plato expresses himself
            with more refinement. <foreign lang="greek">τροφῆς</foreign> does not mean, as some are

            were allowed, if the lot fell upon them, to take part in the regular unions.&rdquo;
            Cf. <bibl n="Plat. Tim. 18D"><title>Tim.</title> 18 D</bibl>

            mentioned&rdquo; (461 C). But in spite of the explicit reference in <foreign lang="greek">ὃ νῦν δὴ ἐλέγομεν</foreign>, Plato has not as yet forbidden such
            unions between &lsquo;brothers&rsquo; and &lsquo;sisters&rsquo;: see 461
            C note The discrepancy is hard to explain, especially as the list in 461 C seems
            intended to be exhaustive. The effect of the prohibition (owing to the meaning now given
            to &lsquo;brother&rsquo; and &lsquo;sister&rsquo;) would be greatly to
            restrict, but not to abolish, unauthorised liaisons.</p>

            exemption Plato's proposals would (according to Richards l.c.) &ldquo;have rendered
            all unions whatever practically <pb n="304"/> impossible.&rdquo; Surely not;
            although they would have unduly favoured the <foreign lang="greek">τηλύγετος
            παῖς</foreign>. A son, for example, who is born when his mother is 21 and his father
            26, cannot marry till he is 49, because he is 29 before his bride can possibly be born,
            and she cannot marry under 20; whereas a son, whose father is 54 and mother 39 when he
            is born, can marry a girl only one year younger than himself, because his father and
            mother retire at 55 and 40 respectively. Did Plato intend the sons of elderly couples to
            marry young, and those of young couples to marry late? Such an inference is unlikely,
            although it is the logical outcome of his theories. In any case Plato did well to
            introduce a saving clause. The <foreign lang="greek">κομψὸς κλῆρος</foreign>, obedient
            to the archons, would couple &lsquo;brothers&rsquo; and
            &lsquo;sisters,&rsquo; whenever it seemed desirable in the interests of the
            State, so long as they were not really blood-relations. (This the archons of course
            would know.) Apollo's priestess would platonize. We must suppose that her assent is
            given in advance, and once for all (although <foreign lang="greek">προσαναιρῇ</foreign> is present and follows <foreign lang="greek">ξυμπίπτῃ</foreign>), unless she had an accredited representative on the spot, which
            there is nothing to indicate. On Plato's attitude to Apollo see IV 427 C note</p>
          <p>461E - 464B Let us now endeavour to shew that community of wives and children is best,
            and in agreement with the general plan of our constitution. That it is the best policy
            Plato proves as follows. A legislator should above all things aim at maintaining unity
            within his city. The most effective instrument for this purpose is community of pleasure
            and pain. As in an individual man, the sufferings of a single member affect the whole,
            so also in a well-governed city, the joys and sorrows of every citizen are shared by
            all. It is easy to shew that our ideal city fulfils this condition in a unique degree,
            both by means of its other institutions, and more especially through the community of
            wives and children.</p>

            A, 443 D. The perfect city is a <foreign lang="greek">ἕν</foreign> with three <foreign lang="greek">πολλά</foreign>&mdash;rulers, auxiliaries, farmers and artisans, or,
            if rulers and auxiliaries are classed together as guardians, then with two. Plato's
            object throughout this episode is to keep the whole city &lsquo;one&rsquo; by
            preventing <hi rend="italic">one</hi> of its constituent factors, viz. the guardians,

            and it indues Our other healthful members ev'n to that sense Of pain.&rdquo; Plato
            goes farther, and represents the partnership as extending also to the soul: see next
            note.</p>
          <p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">πᾶσα ἡ κοινωνία κτλ.</lemma>: &lsquo;the
            entire partnership pervading the body with the soul, organized into a single composite
            organization, viz. that of the ruling power in the partnership&rsquo; etc. Plato's
            language is precise, but difficult. I take <foreign lang="greek">ἡψυχήν</foreign> as defining the <foreign lang="greek">κοινωνία. κατὰ
              τὸ σῶμα</foreign> is written rather than <foreign lang="greek">τοῦ
            σώματος</foreign>, because the partnership is not only a partnership of body with soul,
            but also a partnership of the different parts of body with one another. <foreign lang="greek">τεταγμένη</foreign>&mdash;see cr. n. and App. V &mdash;appears
            to suit <foreign lang="greek">σύνταξις</foreign> better than <foreign lang="greek">τεταμένη</foreign>. A <foreign lang="greek">σύνταξις</foreign> is the ordered
            combination of two or more elements: cf. <bibl n="Plat. Tim. 24C"><title>Tim.</title> 24

            the <foreign lang="greek">σύνταξις</foreign>; although neuter in gender, they really
            refer, not to the soul, but to the whole <foreign lang="greek">σύνταξις</foreign> or
              <foreign lang="greek">σύνολον</foreign>, i.e. <foreign lang="greek">ὁ

            fellow-rulers: they are fellow guardians, their official designation among one another
            serving continually to remind them of their duty to the lower classes. Among themselves
            they use the terms of family relationship, and with these their actions correspond. Thus
            the distinction between <hi rend="italic">meum</hi> and <hi rend="italic">tuum</hi> is

            or rulers (see on II 374 D), as it appears to do here and in 466 A. The following
            explanations may be suggested. (1) Plato intends the community of wives and children to
            extend only to the Auxiliaries, and not also to the Guardians. This view is taken by
            Blaschke (<hi rend="italic">Familienu. G&uuml;tergem. d. Pl. St.</hi> p. 10), who
            asserts that the Rulers proper have already past the limits of age prescribed for
            matrimony. In point of fact, however, a man may become a <foreign lang="greek">τέλεος
              φύλαξ</foreign> at 50 (VII 540 A, B), whereas he can marry till he is 55 (460 E). (2)
            As by far the largest number of husbands would be only Auxiliaries, Plato speaks
            somewhat loosely, as if matrimonial community were confined to them. This explanation is
            possible enough in itself, but fails to explain the usage in 466 A. (3) <foreign lang="greek">ἐπίκουροι</foreign> is used with the new and deeper meaning given to it
            in 463 B (where see note), &lsquo;helpers of the people,&rsquo; rather than in
            its original and technical sense of the rulers' auxiliaries. This suits all the
            passages, and is in my judgment what Plato intended. <foreign lang="greek">ἐπίκουρος</foreign> is not the only term whose connotation deepens as the
              <title>Republic</title> proceeds: cf. II 376 B, III 392 C notes</p>
          <p>464B - 465D Domestic communism is also in harmony with the general communistic
            character of the city. It will cement the union of the guardians and so consolidate the
            State. It will also deliver us from lawsuits arising out of disputes about the family
            and property. In cases of attempted violence to the person, we shall expect a man's
            fellows to defend him. The older citizens will exercise disciplinary powers over the
            younger; reverence and fear will keep the latter from retaliating. All these
            arrangements will tend to keep the rulers at peace with one another, and, <pb n="310"/>
            if they are united, we shall not expect sedition in the rest of the State. Other minor
            advantages there are, too trivial to specify.</p>

            Plato is thinking. I have now reverted to the best supported reading, although the use
            of <foreign lang="greek">τιθέντες</foreign> as virtually equivalent to <foreign lang="greek">ἐπιτιθέντες</foreign> is not free from difficulty. There is
            considerable MS authority (including II) for <foreign lang="greek">ἀνάγκῃ</foreign>,
            and as <foreign lang="greek">ἐπιμέλειαν</foreign> was read by A^{1} (see cr. n.) and
            several other MSS, I once conjectured <foreign lang="greek">&lt;ἐν&gt;
              ἀνάγκῃ σωμάτων ἐπιμέλειαν τιθέντες</foreign>, taking <foreign lang="greek">ἐν
              ἀνάγκῃ</foreign> as meaning <foreign lang="greek">ἀναγκαίαν</foreign>; but this
            idiom is very rare except with <foreign lang="greek">ἐστί, ἦν</foreign> and the
            like. Stobaeus (<title>Flor.</title> 43. 102) and Stallbaum read <foreign lang="greek">ἀνάγκην σωμάτων ἐπιμελείας</foreign>. In <hi rend="italic">q</hi> and two other
            MSS the text runs <foreign lang="greek">ἀνάγκῃ</foreign> (or <foreign lang="greek">ἀνάγκη</foreign>) <foreign lang="greek">σωμάτων ἐπιμελείας τιθέντες</foreign>.
            Does this mean &lsquo;requiring them to guard against violence to the
            person&rsquo; (<foreign lang="greek">ἀνάγκῃ σωμάτων</foreign>)? If Plato meant
            to convey this meaning, it would be preferable to read <foreign lang="greek">ἀνάγκῃ
              σωμάτων ἐπιμέλειαν τιθέντες</foreign> (for which there is also better MS

            <foreign lang="greek">τὴν τοῦ θήλεος πρὸς τὸ ἄῤῥεν</foreign> (466 D). Madvig's
            change of <foreign lang="greek">τό</foreign> to <foreign lang="greek">τοῦ</foreign>
            has met with much favour, and is accepted even by J. and C. To my mind it destroys the

            <foreign lang="greek"> πένητες</foreign> has been variously explained as (1) for
              <foreign lang="greek">&lt;αἷς ἔνοχοι ἂν εἶεν&gt; πένητες</foreign> or
            the like (Schneider), (2) in partitive apposition with the subject of <foreign lang="greek">ἀπηλλαγμένοι ἂν εἶεν</foreign> (one of J. and C.'s alternatives),
            (3) nominative to <foreign lang="greek">ἴσχουσι</foreign> (Shorey in <title>A. J.
            Ph.</title> XVI p. 237). J. and C. also suggest that <foreign lang="greek">κολακείας</foreign> is &ldquo;genitive singular in the same case as <foreign lang="greek">ὧν</foreign>.&rdquo; If so, we should read <foreign lang="greek">ἀλγηδόνος</foreign> with <hi rend="italic">q</hi>: but there is no room for doubt
            that <foreign lang="greek">κολακείας</foreign> is the accusative plural. Of these
            interpretations (1) is too difficult, while (3) is hardly possible, unless <foreign lang="greek">πένητες</foreign> is placed after <foreign lang="greek">ἴσχουσι</foreign>, as was once proposed by Ast, who afterwards preferred to read
              <foreign lang="greek">ἀπηλλαγμένοι ἂν εἶεν &lt;πένητες&gt;</foreign>,
            and finally wished to excise the word altogether. (2) is, I think, defensible, if we
            remember the Greek partiality for this kind of construction (IV 431 A note), and the
            occasional irregularities of Platonic style. See also on VIII 556 C, D. Jackson
            conjectures <foreign lang="greek">πένητος</foreign> (&lsquo;the poor man's
            flatteries of the rich&rsquo;), Stallbaum <foreign lang="greek">πενίας</foreign> in
            the sense of <foreign lang="greek">πενήτων</foreign>. I think <foreign lang="greek">πένητες</foreign> is probably due to Plato: but if not, the word may be a gloss on
              <foreign lang="greek">κολακείας τε πλουσίων</foreign> or on <foreign lang="greek">ἴσχουσι</foreign>.</p>

The future <foreign lang="greek">διδαξομένους</foreign> cannot be right: for the children would certainly be taught to

            conflicts between its members should not be called war, but civil strife. Our natural

          <p>ff. In this episode Plato discusses the principles which are to regulate the
            international policy of his city in her dealings both with Greeks and Barbarians. The
            Greeks themselves recognised certain unwritten laws or usages (<foreign lang="greek">νόμοι κοινοὶ τῆς Ἑλλάδος, νόμιμα τῶν Ἑλλήνων</foreign>) in matters of this
            kind, and to these Plato frequently makes allusion throughout his argument: see on 469
            E, 470 C al. Cf. N&auml;gelsbach <title>Nachhom. Theol.</title> pp.
            300&mdash;307. The policy which Plato here prescribes for his ideal city was clearly
            intended by him to have a direct and immediate bearing on the circumstances of his own
            day; and this part of the <title>Republic</title> is in no small degree, as Jackson

          <p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">Ἕλληνας -- ἄλλῃ</lemma>

            the subject, of <foreign lang="greek">ἀνδραποδίζεσθαι</foreign>. It rightly occupies
            the emphatic place, because the point is that Greek cities should not enslave
              <title>Greeks</title>&mdash;no one objects to their enslaving
            barbarians,&mdash;and not that <title>Greeks</title> (as opposed to barbarians)
            should not enslave Greek cities. Cf. the order in 471 A <foreign lang="greek">οὐδ’
              ἄρα τὴν Ἑλλάδα Ἕλληνες ὄντες κεροῦσιν</foreign>. A further reason for
            taking this view is that <foreign lang="greek">Ἑλληνίδας πόλεις</foreign> points the
            allusion to Plato's city, which is a <foreign lang="greek">Ἑλληνὶς πόλις</foreign>
            (470 E), and therefore will not reduce Greeks to slavery. Finally, <foreign lang="greek">μηδ’ ἄλλῃ</foreign> (sc. <foreign lang="greek">Ἑλληνίδι πόλει</foreign>) is
            easy and natural only if <foreign lang="greek">Ἑλληνίδας πόλεις</foreign> is treated
            as the subject. The difficulty of <foreign lang="greek">μηδ’ ἄλλῃ</foreign> (on the
            usual interpretation) led to the correction <foreign lang="greek">μηδ’
            ἄλλοις</foreign> (Stallbaum with <hi rend="italic">v</hi> and Flor. RT), and has
            recently caused Hartman to propose <foreign lang="greek">μηδαμῇ</foreign>, on the
            ground that <foreign lang="greek">ἄλλῃ</foreign> after <foreign lang="greek">Ἕλληνας</foreign> could only mean <foreign lang="greek">βαρβάρῳ</foreign>. In so

            sold into slavery on the destruction of their city by war (Bl&uuml;mner
              <title>Privatalt.</title> p. 87 note 1). Plato disapproves of the exception: does he
            mean to approve the rule, so far as his own city is concerned? Steinhart
              (<title>Einleitung</title> p. 202) <pb n="321"/> asserts that Plato expressly
            recognises slavery in his State. It is clear from the present section that Plato does
            not impugn the principle of slavery, so long as the slaves are of barbarian origin; but
            he nowhere says that his perfect city is actually to contain slaves, nor is it easy to
            see what there would be for them to do, unless they were employed to work under the
            farmers and artizans, or as personal attendants at the <foreign lang="greek">συσσίτια</foreign> and the like. Slaves are present, of course, in the city of the

            sentiments of chivalry and romance were far more powerful factors in fostering the
            ancestral feud with Persia than any apprehensions for the safety of Greek civilisation.
            The idea of a war against Persia always stirred the pulse of Hellas with a sense of
            continuity with the heroic past; and it was more than a meaningless ceremony when
            Agesilaus sacrificed at Aulis, and Alexander visited Achilles' tomb. See Grote IX p. 81
            and XI pp. 395&mdash;397. None the less, in spite of his emphatic expression of the
            old Greek policy of splendid isolation, it is difficult to overestimate the effect of

            II&mdash;IV has not a few claims to be called Hellenic. But the &lsquo;third
            city&rsquo;&mdash; that of the philosopher-king&mdash;is not Hellenic, nor

            of V 473 B&mdash;VII is assuredly not Hellenic exclusiveness, but the enthusiasm of
            humanity, if by &lsquo;humanity&rsquo; we understand (with Plato) the divine
            element in man, in virtue of which we are most distinctively and truly human. See on VI

            (Krohn <title>Pl. St.</title> p. 33). But Plato's is no barren protest; for his city

            on the foreign policy of Greek cities. The &lsquo;natural&rsquo; relations
            between Greece and Barbary had been reversed: not only did Greeks treat Greeks as
            enemies, but they had begun to treat barbarians as friends. Christ (<title>Pl.
            Stud.</title> pp. 37&mdash;39) supposes that Plato wrote this passage in 374, when
            Plataea was destroyed by Thebes, and the surviving inhabitants fled to Athens (<bibl n="Xen. Hell. 6.3.1">Xen. <title>Hell.</title> VI 3. 1</bibl>, Isocr.
            <title>Plat.</title> 1 ff.). The same view is held by Hirmer <title>Entst. u.
            Komp.</title> etc. p. 662. Plato's rebuke would have been equally or even more telling
            in 386, when Greece was exhausted by the Corinthian war, and friendship with the
            &lsquo;natural enemy&rsquo; had forced the peace of Antalcidas upon the Greeks,
            to the bitter grief and shame of patriots: cf. Isocr. <title>Paneg.</title> 120, 121. In
            any case <foreign lang="greek">νῦν</foreign> should no doubt be referred to the time
            when Plato wrote these words, and not to the date of action of the dialogue. See also

            shew the irrelevancy of the question, &lsquo;Can such a man exist?&rsquo; that
            Plato wrote this sentence. Madvig omits <foreign lang="greek">καί</foreign> before
              <foreign lang="greek">οἷος</foreign>. In that case <foreign lang="greek">εἰ
              γένοιτο</foreign> goes with the following clause (cf. IV 419 A note), and the meaning
            is: &lsquo;if he <hi rend="italic">should</hi> come into existence, what his
            character would be when he did.&rsquo; By this means we obtain an exact parallel

              <foreign lang="greek">ἄνδραοἷος ἂν εἴη</foreign>. It must be
            admitted, I think, that the emendation is an improvement: but the MS reading may stand.
            Campbell needlessly questions <foreign lang="greek">εἰ γένοιτο</foreign>, thinking it
            a gloss on <foreign lang="greek">γενόμενος</foreign>. The pleonasm is characteristic:

            wrong in point of sense to refer the relative to <foreign lang="greek">παράδειγμα</foreign> here. Art is credited with higher possibilities in this passage
            than in Book X, unless we suppose that the painter's <foreign lang="greek">κάλλιστος

          <p>472E - 474C I am nevertheless willing, says Socrates, to shew you how our constitution

            ff. Plato's famous and often quoted paradox is not in its essence so paradoxical as it
            appears. The abiding truth of Plato's suggestion is &ldquo;that somehow or other the

            of social and political administration if any real progress is to take place in
            society&rdquo; (Bosanquet). But it was a paradox in the Athenian democracy, or so at
            least Plato, like Socrates, thought: hence <foreign lang="greek">πολὺ παρὰ δόξαν

            political power and knowledge of the good; it can only be cured by effecting their
            reconciliation. In the <title>Politicus</title> Plato's remedy is to make the
            philosopher (who is the true king) act through the statesman (305 C ff.: cf. Nohle
              <title>Die Statslehre Platos</title> pp. 82, 88, whose interpretation
            is&mdash;wrongly, as I think&mdash;questioned by Zeller^{4} II 1, p. 901 note
            5): but in the <title>Republic</title> the union between Thought and Action is complete,
            and the philosopher is himself a statesman. Whether even then he would be strong enough
            to found the perfect city of the <title>Republic</title>, depends upon the amount of
            resistance which he would be likely to encounter: see on VI 499 B and IX 577 A.</p>

The dual <foreign lang="greek">τούτω</foreign> might easily have been corrupted into <foreign lang="greek">τοῦτο</foreign>, but <foreign lang="greek">τούτω ξυμπέσῃ</foreign> is hardly

            (Schneider, Stallbaum, and others), but rather possessive, and depends on <foreign lang="greek">φύσεις</foreign>. Had Plato meant to say &lsquo;most of those who

            instead of <foreign lang="greek">α&lt;&gt; πολλαὶ φύσεις</foreign>, as
            Hartman points out. There is moreover no reason to suppose that Plato wishes to allow

            &lsquo;volgares&rsquo; (Baiter), or &lsquo;commoner&rsquo; (Jowett), but

            to politics or <foreign lang="greek">φιλοσοφία</foreign> was common, but by no means
            universal, as the examples of Pythagoras, Solon, and many others sufficiently attest:

            explanation removes the difficulty. As regards the sentiment, it <pb n="331"/> should be
            noted that Plato refuses to sanction the exclusive pursuit of knowledge as well as of
            politics. He holds &ldquo;that a specialised study of merely abstract questions
            unfits a man for the true grasp of life and character which is the centre of real
            philosophy&rdquo; (Bosanquet), and on this ground he would probably have condemned
            the one-sided enthusiasm which many persons now profess for what is usually called by
            them &lsquo;research.&rsquo; Cf. VI 497 A note and 499 B.</p>

          <p>474C - 480A The philosopher, as analogy proves, is one who loves not a part of
            knowledge, but the whole. His passion is for Truth, and Truth means the Ideas. The Ideas
            are each of them One, but they appear many by union with particular things and one
            another. Lovers of sights and sounds and such like persons believe only in the many
            beautifuls; they cannot understand the One. Like dreamers, they mistake the copy for the
            original. Their condition of mind may be described as Opinion, that of the philosophers
            as Knowledge.</p>
          <p><title>Let us proceed to prove this statement. The object of Knowledge</title>
              &lsquo;<hi rend="italic">is</hi>&rsquo;<hi rend="italic">; that of
            Ignorance</hi> &lsquo;<hi rend="italic">is not.</hi>&rsquo; <title>If therefore

              it will be something between Knowledge and Ignorance.</hi></p>
          <p>&lsquo;<title>Powers</title>&rsquo; <hi rend="italic">differ from one another
              according to the objects over which they preside, and the effects which they produce.
              The</hi> &lsquo;<hi rend="italic">power</hi>&rsquo; <hi rend="italic">called
              Knowledge presides over Being, and produces the act of knowing. It is therefore
              different from the</hi> &lsquo;<hi rend="italic">power</hi>&rsquo; <hi rend="italic">called Opinion, whose result is opining. What then is the object over
              which Opinion presides? We have seen that it is not Being; neither is it not-Being.
              Therefore Opinion is different both from Knowledge and from Ignorance. It is, in fact,
              something between Knowledge and Ignorance, less luminous than the one, more luminous
              than the other. Its object will therefore be that which both</hi> &lsquo;<hi rend="italic">is</hi>&rsquo; <hi rend="italic">and</hi> &lsquo;<hi rend="italic">is not.</hi>&rsquo;</p>
          <p><title>Now it is just the many beautifuls etc. which both are and are not. There is not
              one of them which</title> &lsquo;<hi rend="italic">is</hi>&rsquo; <hi rend="italic">more than it</hi> &lsquo;<hi rend="italic">is not</hi>&rsquo;
              <hi rend="italic">that which we say it is. We are therefore justified in saying that
              the many beautifuls etc. lie between Being and notBeing. Thus we have discovered the
              object of Opinion.</hi></p>
          <p>
            <hi rend="italic">We conclude that those who have eyes for the many beautifuls etc.,
              opine; while those who see the Beautiful itself, know. The former are lovers of
              Opinion, the latter lovers of Knowledge or philosophers.</hi>

          <p>ff. The <foreign lang="greek">δευτέρα πόλις</foreign> of Books II&mdash;IV rested
            on a psychological basis and was the expression of a moral rather than of an
            intellectual ideal: see on II 370 A and IV 443 B. In harmony with this conception Plato
            formerly used the word <foreign lang="greek">φιλόσοφος</foreign> primarily and for the
            most part in its ethical sense (II 376 B note). Now that he is about to leave psychology

            throughout Books VI and VII, the <foreign lang="greek">φιλόσοφος</foreign> is one whose

            appearance of the Theory of &lsquo;Ideas&rsquo; properly so called in the
              <title>Republic.</title> It should be carefully noted that Plato is not attempting to
            prove the theory: Glauco, in fact, admits it from the first. The Theory was approached
            from two directions, from the side of Mind or Thought (<foreign lang="greek">οἱ λόγοι
              οἱ ἐκ τῶν ἐπιστημῶν</foreign> Arist. <title>Met.</title> 19. 990^{b} 12), and
            from the side of Existence (<foreign lang="greek">τὸ ἓν ἐπὶ πολλῶν</foreign> l.c.
            Cf. Zeller^{4} II 1, pp. 652 ff.). It is the first of these methods which is followed
            throughout the present investigation. The <foreign lang="greek">εἴδη</foreign> provide
            objects for Knowledge, as opposed to Opinion, and they are capable of being known: see
            476 C, E ff., 478 A, 479 E. Throughout a large part of the following discussion, we are
            not much concerned with the Ideas as strictly transcendent entities or <foreign lang="greek">χωριστά</foreign>, existing apart not only from particulars but also
            from the knowing Mind, for it is only in so far as he knows the Ideas that the
            philosopher-king can make use of them (cf. VI 484 C, D): he cannot possibly frame
            political institutions on the model of Ideas which he does not know. We must admit that
            the philosopher's apprehension of the Ideas is the relevant consideration here (cf. VI
            484 C <foreign lang="greek">ἐναργὲς ἐν τῇ ψυχῇ ἔχοντες παράδειγμα</foreign>),
            but it is none the less true, and the fact cannot be too strongly insisted on, that the
            Ideas themselves are not mere concepts of the mind, but have a separate and independent
            existence of their own. See the Appendix to Book VII &lsquo;<hi rend="italic">On
              Plato's Dialectic.</hi>&rsquo; The translation &lsquo;Class&rsquo; for
              <foreign lang="greek">εἶδος</foreign> (Jowett) is inappropriate on many grounds:
            &lsquo;Form&rsquo; is better: but it will be most convenient to retain the usual
              <pb n="336"/> expression &lsquo;Idea,&rsquo; although it is not a translation,
            but a transliteration, whose unfortunate identity with the English word
            &lsquo;idea&rsquo; is responsible in no small measure for many imperfect and
            erroneous interpretations of Plato's Ideal Theory. The German translators mostly render
            by &lsquo;Begriff.&rsquo; The further specifications of the Ideal Theory in this
            passage are as follows. Each Idea is, in and by itself, one (476 A), changeless (479 A,
            479 E), and perfect (VI 484 C, D), contrasting, in each of these respects, with the
            phenomena which &lsquo;partake&rsquo; of or &lsquo;imitate&rsquo; it
            (476 D note). Plato does not now touch on the question how it is that Mind has knowledge
            of a perfection above and beyond what can be derived from observation and experience.
            This faculty of Mind is elsewhere&mdash;in the <title>Meno</title> and the
              <title>Phaedo</title>&mdash;explained by the pre-existence of the Soul. See on 476
            C.</p>
          <p>Krohn has pointed out (<title>Pl. St.</title> p. 96) that the examples of <foreign lang="greek">εἴδη</foreign> now cited by Plato are all of them
              attributes&mdash;<foreign lang="greek">δίκαιον, ἄδικον, ἀγαθόν,
            κακόν</foreign>, etc. It does not however follow from this that the theory of Ideas is
            still in process of formation: on the contrary, the appeal to Glauco just above (475 E)
            implies that it was already a recognised dogma of the Platonic school. The simple
            explanation is that Plato prefers to cite relevant examples. The <foreign lang="greek">εἴδη</foreign> of <foreign lang="greek">δίκαιον, ἀγαθόν, καλόν</foreign> etc.
            are precisely those which it is the philosopher's duty to introduce into the practical
            administration of the State: cf. VI 484 C and X 596 A note</p>
          <p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">αὐτὸ μὲν κτλ.</lemma>: &lsquo;each is, in
            itself&rsquo; (i.e. viewed apart from its association with <foreign lang="greek">πράξεις</foreign> etc.), &lsquo;one, but by reason of their partnership with
            actions and bodies and one another, they each of them make their appearance everywhere
            and appear many.&rsquo; The <foreign lang="greek">εἷδος</foreign> of Beautiful,
            for example, <hi rend="italic">is</hi>, in itself, one, but by <foreign lang="greek">κοινωνία</foreign> with e.g. an act of heroism, a sunset, a river, etc., it <hi rend="italic">appears</hi> many. Similarly the <foreign lang="greek">εἷδος</foreign>
            of Beautiful <hi rend="italic">appears</hi> many by <foreign lang="greek">κοινωνία</foreign> with other <foreign lang="greek">εἴδη</foreign>, as when we say
            &lsquo;the Good is beautiful,&rsquo; the &lsquo;Useful is
            beautiful&rsquo; etc. The expression <foreign lang="greek">πανταχοῦ
            φανταζόμενα</foreign> is better suited to describe Ideas allied with sensible
            particulars, than Ideas allied with Ideas; but statements involving the <foreign lang="greek">κοινωνία</foreign> of Ideas with Ideas &lsquo;make their appearance
            everywhere&rsquo; as well as those which connect the objects of sense with Ideas. In
            all such cases the statements themselves are of course true or false according as the
              <foreign lang="greek">κοινωνία</foreign> is real or imaginary; but whether they are
            false or true, the appearance of <hi rend="italic">plurality</hi> which they give to the
            Idea is always fallacious. Cf. Zeller^{4} II 1, p. 738 note 3 and see on 479 D. The

            knowledge of the Idea, we cannot distinguish between Ideas and phenomena until we

              <foreign lang="greek">παρουσία</foreign> (of the Idea) and <foreign lang="greek">μέθεξις</foreign> (of the particular). A somewhat different figure is involved when
            the Idea is regarded as the Original (Urbild), and the particular as its likeness. Plato
            does not scruple to use both figures side by side: here, for example, the Idea was a
              <foreign lang="greek">παράδειγμα</foreign> just above (<foreign lang="greek">αὐτὸᾧ ἔοικεν</foreign> 476 C: cf. VI 500 E ff., X 596 B).</p>

              (<title>Antisthenica</title> p. 42) supposes that Plato means Antisthenes. There was
            undoubtedly no love lost between the two philosophers: see the authorities cited in
            Urban <hi rend="italic">Ueber die Erw&auml;hnungen der Phil. d. Antisthenes in d.
              Pl. Schr.</hi> (K&ouml;nigsberg 1882), and Zeller^{4} II 1, p. 296 note 2.
            Antisthenes was in particular a bitter opponent of the Theory of Ideas. The passage of
            arms between Plato and him is well known: <foreign lang="greek">ὦ Πλάτων, ἵππον
              μὲν ὁρῶ, ἱππότητα δὲ οὐχ ὁρῶ, καὶ ὃς εἶπεν ἔχεις μὲν ᾧ ἵππος
              ὁρᾶται, τόδε τὸ ὄμμα, ᾧ δε ἱππότης θεωρεῖται, οὐδέπω κέκτησαι</foreign>
            (Simplicius in <title>Schol. Arist.</title> 66^{b} 44 ed. Brandis, and other authorities
            quoted by Urban l.c. p. 3). It is no doubt true, as Stein observes in his
              <title>Geschichte des Platonismus</title>, that Plato's &ldquo;Kunst
            verallgemeinert nicht bloss das Historische, sondern individualisiert auch das
            Allgemeine&rdquo;; but Antisthenes himself could scarcely deny that the cap fits.
            The deictic <foreign lang="greek">οὗτος</foreign> is in favour of D&uuml;mmler's
            view, which certainly adds point to the whole passage; note in particular <foreign lang="greek">χαλεπαίνῃ, παραμυθεῖσθαι, πείθειν ἠρέμα</foreign> (allusions
            perhaps to the ferocity of his opponent: Antisthenes had nicknamed Plato <foreign lang="greek">Σάθων</foreign>! cf. Ath. V 220 D), <foreign lang="greek">οὐχ</foreign>
            <pb n="338"/>
            <foreign lang="greek">ὑγιαίνει</foreign> (&lsquo;is barely sane&rsquo;),

              <foreign lang="greek">ἄσμενοι ἂν ἴδοιμεν εἰδότα τι</foreign>. Antisthenes
            himself wrote a work <foreign lang="greek">περὶ δόξης καὶ ἐπιστήμης</foreign> (D.
            L. VI 17), and Plato may well be thinking of it here: see next note. But we must be
            careful to note that Plato, even if we allow that Antisthenes is in his mind, does not
            refer to Antisthenes alone; he merely individualizes the type in him.</p>

            for Antisthenes (perhaps in his <foreign lang="greek">περὶ δόξης ἢ

              ἀντιλέγειν</foreign>) had argued in almost exactly the same way to prove the
            impossibility of contradiction. See Proclus <hi rend="italic">in Crat.</hi> 37
            (Zeller^{4} II 1 p. 302 note 1) <foreign lang="greek">Ἀντισθένης ἔλεγεν μὴ δεῖν

            feathers his arrows from his victim's wing. Antisthenes and his friends would not of

The present sentence introduces a sort of <foreign lang="greek">πάρεργον</foreign> in which the notion <foreign lang="greek">δύναμις</foreign> is more accurately defined. We may infer that <foreign lang="greek">δυνάμεις</foreign> in the sense of (the intellectual) &lsquo;powers&rsquo;

              <foreign lang="greek">ἐπιστήμην</foreign>. Had Plato written <foreign lang="greek">αὐτὴν τὴν ἐπιστήμην</foreign>, or <foreign lang="greek">ἐπιστήμηνκαὶ αὐτήν</foreign> there would have been little or no
            difficulty. As it is, if the text is right, we should probably (with Schneider and
            others) regard <foreign lang="greek">αὐτήν</foreign> as tautological: cf. IV 428 A

            occurred to Jackson. <foreign lang="greek">δοξάζειν</foreign> is in itself defensible
            and seems at first sight required by the balance of clauses <foreign lang="greek">ἐπιστήμη μέν γέ πουδόξα δέ</foreign>. But the introduction of
              <foreign lang="greek">φαμέν</foreign> breaks the balance, and suggests a new
            departure. The real reason for writing <foreign lang="greek">δοξάζει</foreign> is the
            occurrence of <foreign lang="greek">ἆρ’ οὖν τὸ μὴ ὂν δοξάζει</foreign> (SC.
              <foreign lang="greek">δόξα</foreign>); in 478 B. Unless <foreign lang="greek">δοξάζει</foreign> is read here, it is very difficult to supply the subject of
              <foreign lang="greek">δοξάζει</foreign> there. Reading <foreign lang="greek">δοξάζει</foreign>, again, we supply after <foreign lang="greek">ἦ ταὐτόν</foreign>
            not <foreign lang="greek">δοξάζειν</foreign> (as must be done if the infinitive is
            read), but <foreign lang="greek">δοξάζει</foreign>. This too is an improvement, because
            it provides an exact balance to <foreign lang="greek">γιγνώσκει</foreign>. If Plato had
            meant <foreign lang="greek">ἢ ταὐτὸν δοξάζειν</foreign>, we should expect him to

              τῶν πολλῶν δόγματα</foreign> VI 493 A), who have on every single subject many such
            standards (<foreign lang="greek">πολλὰ νόμιμα</foreign>), mutually inconsistent and
            uncoordinated, because they do not know that <foreign lang="greek">τὸ καλόν, τὸ
              ἀγαθόν</foreign> etc. are each of them <foreign lang="greek">ἕν</foreign>. They
            say, for example, <foreign lang="greek">τὸ ἡδύ</foreign> is <foreign lang="greek">καλόν, τὸ συμφέρον</foreign> is <foreign lang="greek">καλόν, τὸ ἀγαθόν</foreign> is <foreign lang="greek">καλόν</foreign>,&rsquo; and so on. Such assertions give the
            appearance of plurality to <foreign lang="greek">τὸ καλόν</foreign>, by connecting it,
            not indeed with the objects of sense, but with other <foreign lang="greek">εἴδη</foreign> (cf. 476 A, 476 C notes). The form in which Plato expresses his
            conclusion (<foreign lang="greek">τὰ τῶν πολλῶν πολλὰ νόμιμα καλοῦ πέρι</foreign>
            and not simply <foreign lang="greek">τὰ πολλὰ καλά</foreign>) prepares us for VI 484
            C, where the whole purpose of this enquiry is disclosed. It is the business of the
            philosopher-king to bring order out of chaos by remodelling <pb n="344"/> the <foreign lang="greek">νόμιμα</foreign> of the many in conformity with the Idea. He must not
            allow them to predicate <foreign lang="greek">κοινωνία</foreign> of <foreign lang="greek">εἴδη</foreign> unless the <foreign lang="greek">εἴδη</foreign> really
            intercommunicate.</p>
          <p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">πολλὰ καλά</lemma>. Is <foreign lang="greek">καλά</foreign> the plural of &lsquo;<hi rend="italic">the</hi>
            beautiful,&rsquo; or of &lsquo;<hi rend="italic">a</hi> beautiful&rsquo;?
            This question is raised by Bosanquet, who answers it thus: &ldquo;the sentence about
            formulae leads me to interpret it in the former sense=&lsquo;many
            standards,&rsquo; or cases accepted as standards, &lsquo;of
            beauty.&rsquo;&rdquo; Cf. 479 A, where however we have <foreign lang="greek">πολλὰ τὰ καλά</foreign>, and its antithesis <foreign lang="greek">ἓν τὸ
            καλόν</foreign>. The expression <foreign lang="greek">πολλὰ καλά</foreign> must, I
            think, be taken in its usual sense, as the plural of <foreign lang="greek">καλόν
            τι</foreign>; but it includes not only the objects of sense, but also <foreign lang="greek">νόμιμα περὶ καλοῦ</foreign>, which are themselves <foreign lang="greek">πολλὰ καλά</foreign>, because they connect <foreign lang="greek">αὐτὸ
              τὸ καλόν</foreign> with another <foreign lang="greek">εἶδος</foreign>. See last

          <p>485A - 487A The philosophic nature loves eternal and changeless Being in its entirety.
            It follows that the philosopher naturally loves Truth, despises the pleasures of the
            body, is temperate, free from avarice, high-minded, courageous, just and gentle. He is
            also quick to learn, retentive in memory, not given to extravagance in conduct, but
            modest and well-bred. To such men, when years and education have perfected their natural
            qualities, we may fairly entrust our city.</p>
          <p>ff. This section should be compared on the one hand with II 375 A&mdash; 376 C, 377
            B&mdash;III 391 E, and on the other with VII 535 A, B notes In Book II the natural
            qualities insisted on were primarily moral; here and in VII they are primarily
            intellectual. This is in harmony with the difference between the earlier and later
            schemes of education: for the basis of the first was <foreign lang="greek">ὀρθὴ
            δόξα</foreign>, whereas that of the second is <foreign lang="greek">ἐπιστήμη</foreign>. There is little or no indication to shew that even the <foreign lang="greek">ἄρχοντες</foreign> of I&mdash;IV knew or aspired to the Ideas (see
            497 C note) and the <foreign lang="greek">ἐπίκουροι</foreign> certainly did not. Krohn
            is, in a certain sense, right when he maintains that in VI&mdash;VII we have
            &ldquo;einen neuen Archontenstand und eine neue Archontendisciplin&rdquo;
              (<title>Pl. St.</title> p. 107), but the distinction of the
            &lsquo;golden&rsquo; and &lsquo;silver&rsquo; races in III 415 A ff.
            prepares us for a more thorough-going discrimination between the two higher classes than
            was attempted in the earlier sketch, and we must of course remember that the new
            discipline is not intended to supersede, but to supervene upon the old. See also Hirzel

            in behaviour (cf. Arist. <title>Eth. Nic.</title> IV 8. 1125^{a} 12&mdash;16); and
            extravagant behaviour is a form of untruth, because it makes a man appear what he is

            Schneider is fully justified in saying &ldquo;si Plato <foreign lang="greek">ἐπαΐοντες</foreign> scripserat et <foreign lang="greek">οἰόμενοι</foreign>,
            fieri vix poterat, quin prius vitiosum quibusdam et in accusativum mutandum videretur:
            alterum ipsa distantia tutum erat.&rdquo; This is precisely what has happened, for
            while <hi rend="italic">q</hi> (with some other MSS, but not <foreign lang="greek">Π</foreign> or <foreign lang="greek">Ξ</foreign>) has <foreign lang="greek">ἐπαΐοντας</foreign>, <hi rend="italic">all</hi> the MSS, without exception, have
              <foreign lang="greek">οἰόμενοι</foreign>. The anacoluthon is not harsher than other
            instances in which the best MSS have the nominative of the participle instead of the
            accusative, e.g. <bibl n="Plat. Phaedrus 241D"><title>Phaedr.</title> 241 D</bibl>, <bibl n="Plat. Soph. 219E"><title>Soph.</title> 219 E</bibl>, <title>Laws</title> 885 D,
              <bibl n="Plat. Phaedo 81A"><title>Phaed.</title> 81 A</bibl>. See also Classen on
            Thuc. II 53. 4, where many parallel instances are quoted from Thucydides. A long and
            unperiodic sentence like the present is peculiarly liable to anacolutha: and one has
            occurred already in 488 C. For these reasons I now agree with Schneider and others that
            the text is sound. The nominatives <foreign lang="greek">πείθοντες</foreign> and
              <foreign lang="greek">βιαζόμενοι</foreign> may have suggested the change to Plato:
              &ldquo;<foreign lang="greek">ψέγοντας</foreign> propter <foreign lang="greek">ἐπαινοῦντας</foreign> tenuit, mox velut impatiens tenoris diu servati paullisper de
            via deflexit&rdquo; (Schneider). Similar ungrammatical anacolutha are found
            occasionally also in Inscriptions, when the sentence runs to a considerable length: see
            Meisterhans^{3} pp. 203, 205.</p>
          <p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ὅπως δὲ...κυβερνητικήν</lemma>. The sailors,
            Plato has already told us, have not the smallest idea that the true pilot must study the
            year and the seasons etc., if he is to be truly qualified to rule a ship (that is to
            say, from Plato's point of view, <hi rend="italic">if he is to know how to steer</hi>),
            but as for <hi rend="italic">how</hi> he shall steer&mdash;let people wish him to or
            no&mdash;of <hi rend="italic">that</hi> they think it impossible to acquire either
            art or study and therewith (lit. &lsquo;at-once-and&rsquo;) the art of
            steersmanship. We may translate the sentence thus: &lsquo;but art or system of <hi rend="italic">how</hi> to steer, let alone whether people wish him to steer or
            no&mdash;that they think it impossible to acquire, and therewithal the art of
            steering.&rsquo; The true pilot, according to Plato, is one who knows <hi rend="italic">how</hi> to steer. Whether others wish him to steer or no, is wholly
            irrelevant; see <bibl n="Plat. Plt. 293A"><title>Pol.</title> 293 A</bibl> ff., where
            this principle is declared to be of universal application, and illustrated as follows
            from the case of doctors: <foreign lang="greek">ἰατροὺς δὲ οὐχ ἥκιστα
              νενομίκαμεν, ἐάν τε ἑκόντας ἐάν τε ἄκοντας ἡμᾶς ἰῶνται πάντως
              οὐδὲν ἧττον ἰατρούς φαμεν, ἕωσπερ ἂν ἐπιστατοῦντες
              τέχνῃσῴζωσιν οἱ θεραπεύοντες ἕκαστοι τὰ θεραπευόμενα</foreign>.
            Cf. ibid. C <foreign lang="greek">ἀναγκαῖον δὴ καὶ πολιτειῶν ταύτην
              ὀρθὴν διαφερόντως εἶναι καὶ μόνην πολιτείαν, ἐν ᾗ τις ἂν εὑρίσκοι
              τοὺς ἄρχοντας ἀληθῶς ἐπιστήμονας καὶ οὐ δοκοῦντας μόνον, ἐάν τε κατὰ
              νόμους ἐάν τε ἄνευ νόμων ἄρχωσι, καὶ ἑκόντων καὶ ἀκόντων κτλ.</foreign>
            The expressions <foreign lang="greek">ἐάν τε ἑκόντας ἐάν τε ἄκοντας</foreign>,
            and <foreign lang="greek">καὶ ἑκόντων καὶ ἀκόντων</foreign> in these two passages,
            the general drift of which is the same as Plato's argument throughout this part of the
              <title>Republic</title>, exactly correspond to <foreign lang="greek">ἐάν τέ τινες
              βούλωνται ἐάν τε μή</foreign>, and enable us to interpret that clause, as
            Schneider has already pointed out. Cf. also 296 E&mdash; 297 B. Plato, indeed, is
            ready to go farther still, and would maintain that he who knows how to steer is a true
            pilot, even although he does not touch the helm (cf. ibid. 292 E). If others wish for
            his services, it is their business to apply to him, not his to sue for the opportunity
            of doing them a service (infra 489 B, C). A like principle holds good in the government
            of cities, and the Platonic Socrates, though abstaining from political life, may fairly
            claim <foreign lang="greek">ἐπιχειρεῖν τῇ ὡς ἀληθῶς πολιτικῇ τέχνῃ καὶ
              πράττειν τὰ πολιτικὰ μόνος τῶν νῦν</foreign> (<bibl n="Plat. Gorg. 521D"><title>Gorg.</title> 521 D</bibl>). The foolish sailors, on the other hand, desire
            only to get the <pb n="12"/> helm into their hands (488 C): how to handle it, they know
            not, and deny that it is possible to learn (<foreign lang="greek">μήτε
              τέχνην λαβεῖν</foreign>). What of <foreign lang="greek">ἅμα καὶ τὴν
              κυβερνητικήν</foreign>? These words should be taken closely with what goes before.
            The literal translation is (to acquire) &lsquo;at once and the art of
            steering&rsquo;: cf. <bibl n="Plat. Phileb. 22D"><title>Phil.</title> 22 D</bibl>
            <foreign lang="greek">ὁ βίος οὗτος γέγονεν αἱρετὸς ἅμα καὶ ἀγαθός</foreign>
            &lsquo;this life is at once choiceworthy and good.&rsquo; Now &lsquo;to
            acquire at once the art of how to steer (<foreign lang="greek">ὅπως κυβερνήσει,
              τούτου τέχνην</foreign>) and the art of steering&rsquo; is merely a way of
            saying &lsquo;to acquire the art of how to steer and therewith the art of
            steering.&rsquo; He who learns the art and study of how to steer necessarily learns
            therewith the art of steering (&ldquo;quarum qui compos factus sit, simul
            gubernatoriam artem teneat&rdquo; Schneider): for <foreign lang="greek">κυβερνητική</foreign> is, according to Plato, simply and solely the art of <hi rend="italic">how</hi> to steer. <foreign lang="greek">τὴν κυβερνητικήν</foreign>,
            in short, is nothing but the <foreign lang="greek">τέχνη</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">μελέτη τούτου ὅπως κυβερνήσει</foreign>, expressed from Plato's
            point of view. Thus in denying that it is possible to learn either <foreign lang="greek">τέχνη</foreign> or <foreign lang="greek">μελέτη</foreign> of <hi rend="italic">how</hi> to steer, the sailors are in effect emphatically denying that it is possible
            to learn <foreign lang="greek">κυβερνητική</foreign> in Plato's sense of the word at
            all: cf. 488 B <foreign lang="greek">φάσκοντες μηδὲ διδακτὸν εἶναι</foreign>. So
            much for the meaning of this passage as a whole. In regard to details, it should be
            noted that <foreign lang="greek">ὅπως</foreign> means &lsquo;how&rsquo;:
              &lsquo;<foreign lang="greek">ὅπως</foreign> ad <foreign lang="greek">τούτου</foreign> spectans modum et rationem potius quam finem significat&rsquo;
            (after Schneider). With Schneider also I understand <foreign lang="greek">κυβερνήσει</foreign> as &lsquo;shall steer&rsquo; and not &lsquo;shall get
            possession of the helm.&rsquo; <foreign lang="greek">μελέτη</foreign> is
            &lsquo;study&rsquo; (in the more concrete sense of the word), rather than actual
            exercise or practice: cf. III 402 B <foreign lang="greek">ἔστι τῆς αὐτῆς τέχνης τε
              καὶ μελέτης</foreign>. With <foreign lang="greek">τέχνην λαβεῖν</foreign> cf.
              <bibl n="Plat. Plt. 300E"><title>Pol.</title> 300 E</bibl>.</p>
          <p>The above explanation agrees in the main with that of Schneider, and is in my opinion
            what Plato meant to say. For other views see App. I.</p>

            (<title>Rhet.</title> II 16. 1391^{a} 8 ff.), Simonides. Being asked on one occasion by
            Hiero's queen whether it was better to be a man of genius (<foreign lang="greek">σοφός</foreign>) or rich, he replied &ldquo;Rich; for men of genius are found at
            the court of the rich&rdquo;&mdash;a characteristic reply, by which the
            courtliest of ancient poets contrived to flatter the queen without forgetting himself.
            (It should be remembered that <foreign lang="greek">σοφός</foreign> often means
            &lsquo;poet&rsquo;.) There is no reason for supposing (with e.g.
            Teichm&uuml;ller <title>Lit. Fehd.</title> I p. 102) that Plato attributed the
            saying to Aristippus, although a witticism on the subject is ascribed both to him (D. L.
            II 8. 69) and to Antisthenes (Winckelmann <title>Antisth. Frag.</title> p. 58). Plato
            liked to get his knife into Simonides: see I 331 E ff.</p>

            the most serious prejudice from which Philosophy suffers is owing to those who pretend
            to be philosophers when they are not. It is they who are meant, when people assert that
            the majority of philosophers are depraved. Let us endeavour to shew that Philosophy is
            not responsible for the corruption of the philosophic nature. The true philosopher, in
            spite of popular misconceptions, is, as we have seen, naturally a lover of Truth, and
            therefore possesses all the virtues of character already named. We have to enquire (1)
            how this disposition becomes in many cases depraved and (2) what is the character of the

            politics, the expression was applied to the wealthy or oligarchical party (cf. VIII 569

            extraordinary fascination: see Zeller^{3} III 2, pp. 611&mdash;618. The imagery
            should be compared with <bibl n="Plat. Theaet. 156A"><title>Theaet.</title> 156 A</bibl>
            ff. where the phenomena of Perception are thus analysed. The Subject unites with the
            Object, and from this union are born two children, one the <foreign lang="greek">αἴσθησις</foreign> e.g. Sight, the other the <foreign lang="greek">αἰσθητόν</foreign> e.g. <foreign lang="greek">τὸ μέλαν</foreign>. The former
            belongs more peculiarly to the Subject, the latter to the Object. Similarly with the
            phenomena of Knowledge. The Subject unites with the Idea, and the children of this union
            are <foreign lang="greek">νοῦς</foreign> (or rather, strictly speaking, <foreign lang="greek">νόησις</foreign> i.e. the <hi rend="italic">action</hi> of <foreign lang="greek">νοῦς</foreign>), on the side of the Subject, and the <foreign lang="greek">νοητόν</foreign>, i.e. Truth, on the side of the Object. We miss an
            essential point if we take <foreign lang="greek">νοῦν</foreign> as the <hi rend="italic">object</hi> of Knowledge; it is the faculty of Reason, no longer
            dormant, but suddenly called into actuality. Plato means that Reason does not really
            live until it lays hold on the Idea. <foreign lang="greek">γνοίη</foreign> corresponds
            to <foreign lang="greek">νοῦν</foreign>; it is by the begetting of <foreign lang="greek">νοῦς</foreign> that we come to know. The aorist denotes the

            Plato is thinking not merely of the lover's pangs, but also of the pangs of birth. The
            knowledge of the Idea is indeed in Plato's view an intellectual and moral regeneration.
            But <foreign lang="greek">ἀπολήγοι τοῦ ἔρωτος</foreign> shews that <foreign lang="greek">ὠδῖνος</foreign> means the throes of love; and the further view

            (cf. 489 D): but the former is by far the more serious evil (491 E, 495 B), though

          <p>491A - 495B The philosophic nature is a rare growth, whose very virtues render it
            peculiarly liable to corruption, when it is placed in unfavourable surroundings. The
            clamorous voice of public opinion, expressed in assemblies and other gatherings of the
            people, inevitably corrupts the youth by moulding them into conformity with itself.
            Where necessary, force is employed, under the name of punishment. Against these
            influences, no teacher can possibly contend, although the providence of God may save
            some. As for the Sophists, they do but make into a system and teach the opinions of the
            Multitude, which they are wholly unable to justify, but accept without reserve, as their
            profession requires them to do. Remember too that the Ideas are foolishness to the Many,
            so that they will never love Wisdom or her followers. Socrates concludes with a vivid
            and lifelike picture of a philosophic nature in process of corruption.</p>

            given by Plato in 494 B ff. They bring their possessor to the front, and therefore
            expose him to the solicitations of selfish and unscrupulous men. It should be carefully
            borne in mind that <foreign lang="greek">ἀνδρεία</foreign> and the other virtues are
            here regarded, not as the result of education, but as natural qualities, derived from
            the philosopher's native love of truth. We are in fact dealing with the <hi rend="italic">potentiality</hi> of the <foreign lang="greek">τελέως

            towards saving and improving strong and gifted natures: cf. VII 519 A, B. Weak natures

            it is their profession to flatter and court (493 A&mdash;D). But from Plato's point
            of view this is itself a sufficiently grave indictment to bring against a professional
            teacher of Morality (see 493 C), so that the present attack on the Athenian people is

          <p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">οὔτε γὰρ κτλ.</lemma> Plato has just declared that
            it would be the height of folly in a teacher even to attempt to make a young man run
            counter to public opinion. The present sentence explains why. There is not, never has
            been, and never will be produced a character different (from the Many) in respect of
            virtue, by having been educated on principles opposed to the education which the Many
            provide (the force of public sentiment, expressed in assemblies etc.). Consequently
            every attempt to produce such a character by means of education in the teeth of public
            opinion is foredoomed to failure. The statement appears at first sight extraordinary;
            but from Plato's point of view it is, with the limitations which he makes, strictly
            correct. Cities are either actual or ideal. In the ideal city, education does not
            produce a type of character which conflicts with public opinion, because public opinion
            is itself formed by education. In actual cities, education must conform to the same
            standard if it is to exist at all: for <foreign lang="greek">τὸν μὴ πειθόμενον
              ἀτιμίαις τε καὶ χρήμασι καὶ θανάτοις κολάζουσι</foreign> (492 D). How then are
            we to explain the presence of great and good men in existing cities? They are <foreign lang="greek">θεῖοι ἄνδρες</foreign>, saved from corruption by grace of God: see on
            493 A. In these circumstances, what is the political reformer to do? He must break with
            all existing cities (497 B), and found&mdash;as Plato now wishes to do&mdash;a
            new commonwealth in which sound education and public opinion no longer differ, but
            agree. In other words, his policy must be to make the Philosopher King. For other views
            of this passage see App. II.</p>

            have they any scientific knowledge of statesmanship; for which reason also they cannot
            teach their sons to be statesmen (<bibl n="Plat. Meno 94B"><title>Men.</title> 94
            B</bibl>, <bibl n="Plat. Prot. 320A"><title>Prot.</title> 320 A</bibl>). It was by this
            theory that Plato accounted for the fact that good men appear from time to time even in
            corrupt States: <foreign lang="greek">εἰσὶ γὰρ ἐν τοῖς πολλοῖς ἄνθρωποι ἀεὶ

            touch of irony in the epithet <foreign lang="greek">θεῖος</foreign> when Plato applies
            it to Themistocles, Pericles and other successful politicians with whom he had little
            sympathy, but <foreign lang="greek">θεοῦ μοῖραν</foreign> is not ironical here (cf.
            492 A), nor is Plato ever otherwise than grateful for the birth of statesmen who are
            truly <foreign lang="greek">θεῖοι</foreign>. But they do not solve the difficulty, for
            the scientific knowledge of <foreign lang="greek">πολιτική</foreign> is not only better
            and more stable in itself, but guarantees the permanent prosperity of a State, because
            it can be transmitted to posterity. Nor can we be sure that our statesmen &lsquo;by
            grace of God&rsquo; will appear when they are most wanted. For a full discussion of

            necessity, is illustrated by Leutsch u. Schneidewin <title>Paroem. Gr.</title> I p. 59,
            II p. 367, and also by Blaydes on Ar. l.c. Two explanations of it were given. According
            to the first, which is adopted by the Scholiast on this passage, the phrase originated
            in the treatment meted out by Diomede to Odysseus, when they were returning from Ilium
            to the Greek camp after stealing the Palladium. Odysseus attempted to kill Diomede, but
            failed, and Diomede paid him out by tying his arms together and driving him home with
            blows from the flat of his sword. The Scholiast on Ar. l.c. explains differently.
              <foreign lang="greek">Διομήδεια</foreign>: <foreign lang="greek">ὅτι Διομήδης ὁ

            may be inferred both from the rhythm (<foreign lang="greek">σχηματισμοῦκενοῦ</foreign>) and the language. <foreign lang="greek">ἄνευ νοῦ</foreign> is declared by van Prinsterer, Cobet and others to be a gloss
            on <foreign lang="greek">κενοῦ</foreign>. Possibly they are right; but (as Schneider
            remarks) <foreign lang="greek">ὅτι νοῦς οὐκ ἔνεστιν αὐτῷ</foreign> is in favour

          <p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">τὸ ξυγγενὲς κτλ.</lemma>: i.e. the affinity of what
            is said with his nature, &ldquo;weil die Reden mit ihm verwandt sind&rdquo;
            (Schneider). D. and V.'s translation &ldquo;an inborn taste for philosophic
            inquiry&rdquo; is wrong.</p>
          <p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">εἷς</lemma> has often been doubted; but Schneider's
            explanation is certainly right, that <foreign lang="greek">τῷ οὕτω
            διατιθεμένῳ</foreign> is the individual typifying a class, and that <foreign lang="greek">εἷς</foreign> denotes <hi rend="italic">one</hi> of the class. The
            idiom is analogous to the plural after a typical or generic singular: see on I 374 A.
            The emendations proposed (<foreign lang="greek">διαισθάνηται</foreign> for <foreign lang="greek">εἷς αἰσθάνηται</foreign> Stallbaum, <foreign lang="greek">εἰσαῦθις</foreign> Richter, <foreign lang="greek">εἴσω</foreign> Madvig, <foreign lang="greek">εἰσακούων</foreign> or <foreign lang="greek">εἰσακούσας</foreign>
            Richards) are not only superfluous, but indefensible in themselves. Plato hardly expects
            more than one such person to pause at all on his downward career. Here again we
            naturally think of Alcibiades, whose interviews with Socrates (according to <bibl n="Plat. Sym. 215D"><title>Symp.</title> 215 D</bibl>) profoundly impressed him for
            the moment, but failed to effect a permanent reform in the midst of so many temptations
            (ib. 216 B). Perhaps Socrates once hoped that Alcibiades would be his
            &lsquo;scientific ruler,&rsquo; and bring back true prosperity to Athens. A tone
            of sorrow for the &lsquo;lost leader&rsquo; seems to make itself felt in Plato's
            words.</p>

            like after <foreign lang="greek">οὐ</foreign>, and regard the participles as agreeing
            with the subject of <foreign lang="greek">δράσειν</foreign>. (Schneider and J. and C.
            take nearly the same view). <foreign lang="greek">δράσειν</foreign> is of course easy
            to understand, but it is less easy to dispense with <foreign lang="greek">πάντα</foreign>. Could Plato have written <foreign lang="greek">οὐ

            the charge against Socrates was that he corrupted the youth (<bibl n="Plat. Apol. 24B"><title>Ap.</title> 24 B</bibl>), and Alcibiades was held to be a case in point
              (<bibl n="Xen. Mem. 1.2.12">Xen. <title>Mem.</title> I 2. 12</bibl>). Plato now turns
            the tables on the Athenian people. He says in effect &lsquo;It was you who corrupted

          <p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ἐκ τῶν τεχνῶν κτλ.</lemma> It has been supposed
            that Plato has in view Antisthenes and the Cynic Diogenes, the latter of whom apparently
            started life as a moneychanger (D. L. VI 20). But the description which follows applies
            to sophists and sophistical rhetoricians rather than to the Cynic philosophers. The poet
            Gray says &ldquo;this seems to be aimed at Protagoras, who was an ordinary
            countryman and a woodcutter&rdquo; (see Gellius <title>Noct. Att.</title> V 3 and
            other authorities cited by Frei <title>Quaest. Prot.</title> pp. 6 ff.). Hermann
              (<title>Gesch. u. Syst.</title> p.628) cites Euthydemus and Dionysodorus as cases in
            point (cf. 496 A note). Each of these sophists had formerly taught the art of fighting
            in full armour (<bibl n="Plat. Euthyd. 271C"><title>Euthyd.</title> 271
            C</bibl>&mdash; 272 B, 273 E). As speech-writing and rhetoric generally were counted
            among the arts, we may think also of Isocrates, who loved above everything to call
            himself a <foreign lang="greek">φιλόσοφος</foreign> (<title>Antid.</title> 271 ff.).
            But although these and other examples may be quoted in illustration of what Plato here
            says, the tone of the whole passage shews that Plato is describing a familiar phenomenon
            of his own times, when clever and ambitious young men were in the habit of forsaking
            their handicrafts and devoting themselves to &lsquo;culture.&rsquo; Cf. <bibl n="Plat. Prot. 318E"><title>Prot.</title> 318 E</bibl>
            <foreign lang="greek">τὰς γὰρ τέχνας αὐτοὺς πεφευγότας ἄκοντας πάλιν αὖ

          <p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ἐφιέμενοι κτλ.</lemma> is an anacoluthon. The
            natural flow of the sentence is interrupted by the question <foreign lang="greek">ἢ
              οὐκ ἀνάγκη;</foreign> which is intended to obtain Adeimantus' assent to <foreign lang="greek">τὰς ψυχὰστυγχάνουσιν</foreign>. On resuming, Plato
            interposes a comparison, and to this the general idea which forms the logical predicate
            to <foreign lang="greek">πολλοί</foreign> is accommodated in <foreign lang="greek">ποῖ̓ ἄτταφαῦλα</foreign>. The sentence was thus understood by the
            editor of <hi rend="italic">q</hi>; for <foreign lang="greek">τυγχάνουσιν</foreign>,
            which seems a difficulty on this theory, is in <hi rend="italic">q</hi>
            <foreign lang="greek">τυγχάνοντες</foreign>. But <foreign lang="greek">τυγχάνοντες</foreign> would be extremely inelegant; and Plato writes <foreign lang="greek">τυγχάνουσιν</foreign> to correspond to <foreign lang="greek">λελώβηνται</foreign>. Even in other cases a finite verb sometimes replaces a
            participle in the second of two contrasted clauses, e.g. <bibl n="Plat. Apol. 21E"><title>Ap.</title> 21 E</bibl>. J. and C. explain the passage in nearly the same
            way, as well as (apparently) Schneider and Stallbaum. It is impossible for many reasons
            to connect <foreign lang="greek">τυγχάνουσιν</foreign> with <foreign lang="greek">ἐφιέμενοι</foreign> and so escape the anacoluthon. I formerly suspected the text,
            and proposed <foreign lang="greek">&lt;ἀπο&gt; τυγχάνουσιν</foreign>
            (&lsquo;miss the mark,&rsquo; i.e. fail to win the distinction which they
            covet). Another solution might be to place the troublesome <foreign lang="greek">τυγχάνουσιν</foreign> after <foreign lang="greek">πολλοί</foreign>. But neither
            change is in any degree probable; and it is better to acquiesce in the reading of the
            MSS. Plato's anacolutha are a device for imparting life and reality to his dialogues. A
            careful translation should preserve them all.</p>

            was &ldquo;primarily a military conception, dependent for its origin on the obvious
            fact that certain modes of life and the exercise of certain trades disqualify from

            quoting in support Hdt. II 165&mdash;167). &ldquo;Sedentary and within-door
            arts,&rdquo; says Bacon (quoted by Newman <title>Politics of Aristotle</title> I p.
            105), &ldquo;have in their nature a contrariety to a military
            disposition.&rdquo; In practice the term is freely applied by the writers of the
            best period to every kind of mechanical or illiberal labour or pursuit. Aristotle
            defines <foreign lang="greek">βαναυσία</foreign> in these words: <foreign lang="greek">βάναυσον δ’ ἔργον εἶναι δεῖ τοῦτο νομίζειν καὶ τέχνην ταύτην καὶ

            which does not look like an Attic word, may be connected with <foreign lang="greek">βανά</foreign>. If so, the word perhaps originally meant
            &lsquo;effeminate&rsquo; &lsquo;unmanly&rsquo;: cf. <foreign lang="greek">θηλυνομένων</foreign> in the extract quoted from Xenophon. In any case,

            Stallbaum's explanation &lsquo;overtaken by exile,&rsquo; which D. and V.
            apparently accept, is in my judgment wrong. The reading <foreign lang="greek">καταλειφθέν</foreign> (<hi rend="italic">q</hi> and several other MSS, followed by
            Ast and one or two other scholars) is less expressive and picturesque, though it gives a

            instances in view? Steinhart (<title>Einleitung</title> p. 208) thinks of Anaxagoras,
            and even of Plato himself. But it cannot be said that either of them was saved by exile
            from deserting Philosophy, and Plato was hardly exiled, even metaphorically speaking.
            Krohn (<title>Pl. St.</title> pp. 117, 384) declares for Xenophon. It is however more
            than doubtful, even after Boeckh's attempt to overthrow the tradition about
            unfriendliness between Xenophon and Plato (<title>De simultate quam Pl. c. Xen.
              exercuisse fertur</title> 1811), whether Plato would have gone out of his way to pay a
            compliment to his fellow-disciple. Can Plato be thinking of his friend Dio? If so, this
            passage must have been written in or after 367 B.C., the year of Dio's banishment from
            Syracuse. A personal reference is easily combined with the description of a class, and a
            tribute to Dio would be very pleasing here. I have lately found the same conjecture in

          <p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">βραχὺ δέ πού τι κτλ.</lemma> Some have thought of
            Phaedo of Elis, and Simon the Athenian, both of whom were members of the Socratic circle
            (Steinhart l.c. p. 208). The latter (whose very existence has been denied by some recent
            critics, but&mdash;as Hirzel <title>Der Dialog</title> pp. 102 ff.
            shews&mdash;on wholly inadequate grounds) was once a shoemaker (D. L. II 122). We
            may also in some respects compare the architect-philosopher Hippodamus of Miletus: see
            Susemihl and Hicks' <title>Politics of Aristotle</title> I pp. 331&mdash;334.
            Zeller^{4} II 1, p. 52 note 1 thinks Plato may have had Socrates himself in view, but

            Greek literature too seldom recognises that physical weakness may be combined with
            mental and moral strength: see III 406 C note Plutarch (<hi rend="italic">de tuenda san.

            his divine sign as a special if not unique revelation from God, without submitting it to
            further analysis. As here, so in <bibl n="Plat. Apol. 31D"><title>Ap.</title> 31 D</bibl>,
            it is this which forbids him to enter on political life (<foreign lang="greek">τοῦτ’
              ἔστιν ὅ μοι ἐναντιοῦται τὰ πολιτικὰ πράττειν</foreign>). What the phenomenon
            really was, is a question which different writers have answered differently, according
            to their different points of view: see Zeller^{4} II 1 pp. 75&mdash;91. The subject
            is treated with great fulness in Ribbing's <title>Socrat. Stud.</title> II pp. 1 ff. and
            in Riddell's edition of the <title>Apology</title> pp. 109&mdash;117. <foreign lang="greek">τῶν ἔμπροσθεν γέγονε</foreign> does not deny that such a sign may be
            vouchsafed to others in the future. Schneider conjectures that Plato added this
            limitation with a view to himself&mdash;an unlikely supposition, although no doubt
            the present passage is in some measure intended as a defence of Plato's abstention from

            like a lonely human being in the midst of wild beasts. Cf. <title>Timon of
            Athens</title> IV 3 &ldquo;The commonwealth of Athens is become a forest of
            beasts.&rdquo; The comparison may have been suggested to Plato by Pherecrates'
              <foreign lang="greek">Ἄγριοι</foreign>, to which he alludes in <bibl n="Plat. Prot. 327D"><title>Prot.</title> 327 D</bibl>. In Pherecrates' play the
              <foreign lang="greek">Ἄγριοι</foreign> were savages, to whom apparently some
            Athenians betook themselves, in the hope of finding more happiness than they enjoyed in
            Athens: see Kock's <title>Com. Graec. Fr.</title> I pp. 146&mdash;150. Plato points
            out that there are savages enough at home. In <foreign lang="greek">πᾶσιν
            ἀγρίοις</foreign> the emphasis is on <foreign lang="greek">πᾶσιν</foreign>: we should
            translate &lsquo;to hold out alone where all are savages.&rsquo; Cf. <foreign lang="greek">ὑπὸ πάντων πολεμίων</foreign> IX 579 B. Herwerden weakens the effect
            by adding <foreign lang="greek">οὖσιν</foreign> after <foreign lang="greek">ἀγρίοις</foreign>.</p>

            &lsquo;a storm of dust&rsquo; is scarcely a Greek idiom. <foreign lang="greek">κονιορτοῦφερομένου</foreign> is of course a descriptive genitive
            absolute. In this way Schneider also took the passage. <foreign lang="greek">ζάλη</foreign> is &lsquo;tempestuous rain&rsquo; <foreign lang="greek">μετὰ
              ὄμβρου πνοή</foreign>, as Hesychius explains. <foreign lang="greek">χαλάζης</foreign> was once conjectured by Ast, but he afterwards rightly withdrew the
            suggestion. Herwerden proposes <foreign lang="greek">οἷον ἐν ζάλῃ κονιορτοῦ ὑπὸ
              κτλ.</foreign>, and Richards <foreign lang="greek">ἐν χειμῶνι καὶ κονιορτοῦ
            ζάλῃ</foreign> (or <foreign lang="greek">ζάλῃ κονιορτοῦ</foreign>). Neither
            proposal is supported by any of the ancient citations, except that of Themistius
              (<title>Or.</title> VIII p. 104 C) whose reproduction of this passage is in other
            respects, as in this, extremely inaccurate: see Schneider's note. And <foreign lang="greek">ζάλη κονιορτοῦ</foreign> is, to say the least, a questionable phrase.
            It is not well to mar the wonderful force and beauty of writing such as this by
            tasteless and inept conjectures. The passage has often been compared with Lucretius'
            &ldquo;Suave mari magno,&rdquo; but the difference is greater than the
            resemblance. The Platonic philosopher is content (<foreign lang="greek">ἀγαπᾷ</foreign>), if he can keep his own soul pure, because he cannot, as things now
            are, save both himself and others. But it is no pleasure for him to see
            &ldquo;quibus ipse malis careat,&rdquo; for he would fain help others if they
            would but let him. That they will not is a misfortune, not for others only, but for him
              (<foreign lang="greek">αὐτός τε μᾶλλον αὐξήσεται κτλ.</foreign>). We seem to
            catch in Plato's words a certain tone of sorrow, as if he had not himself attained the
            highest of which he was capable, because he could not find a philosophic city in which
            to dwell: see Morgenstern <title>De Plat. rep.</title> p. 161, where reference is made
            to <bibl n="Plat. Apol. 31E"><title>Ap.</title> 31 E</bibl> and to the Platonic Epistles V

            also some hints or traces of the later view: see on III 414 A, IV 423 E (to which,
            perhaps, <foreign lang="greek">ἐρρήθη</foreign> is intended to refer, although the

            determination not to let Socrates slur over the questions relating to women and children
            (V 449 B ff.) and to the possibility of realising the perfect city (471 C ff.). Cf.

          <p>498C - 502C Adimantus hardly expects the reasoning of Socrates to carry conviction to
            most of his hearers. But Socrates will not despair, believing that his words may perhaps
            bear fruit hereafter, if not here. As for the Multitude, their dissent is easily
            explained. They have heard enough of jingling rhetoric, but they have never yet seen a
            Philosopher-king, nor are they accustomed to discourses whose only aim is truth. Our
            perfect city is realised always and everywhere, wheresoever and whensoever Philosophy
            sits on the throne. The Multitude will assent, if we approach them rightly; for their
            hatred is against the false philosophers, and not against the true. The lover of Truth
            is absorbed in contemplation of the changeless Realities, on the model of which he will
            frame human institutions, should he be called upon to enter public life. Point this out

            elder Dionysius was just dead&rdquo; (Thomas Gray <title>Works</title> ed. Gosse IV
            p. 251). In the parallel passage V 473 D Plato speaks of kings and <foreign lang="greek">δυνάσται</foreign>, but not yet of kings' sons. The substance of Gray's conjecture
            is confirmed by recent criticism (see e.g. Hirmer <title>Entst. u. Kompos.</title> etc.
            p. 668): but Dionysius I died in Ol. 103, 2 (367 B.C.) and not in Ol. 101, 3 (374 B.C.),
            and Plato's second visit to Sicily seems to have taken place just after the old tyrant's
            death (Grote X pp. 346&mdash;356). See also on V 473 D, VI 496 B and

            understands (cf. 501 A note). He would not however allow that the difficulty is
            insurmountable; since a <foreign lang="greek">θεία τις τύχη</foreign> (IX 592 A) may
            well occur. But the true fulfilment of Plato's Ideal, as he himself foretells in IX 592

            take the word in its etymological signification, as is clear from <foreign lang="greek">θεοείκελον</foreign> below. The stress in <foreign lang="greek">ἀνδρείκελον</foreign>, as in <foreign lang="greek">θεοειδές</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">θεοείκελον</foreign>, is on the first part of the compound: it is not

            It is pleasing to meet with so cordial and spontaneous an acknowledgment of Homer as a
            kindred spirit in a passage so full of Plato's characteristic idealism. There is more
            than a grain of truth in Longinus' observation: <foreign lang="greek">μόνος Ἡρόδοτος
              Ὁμηρικώτατος ἐγένετο; Στησίχορος ἔτι πρότερον ὅ τε Ἀρχίλοχος, πάντων

              ἀνδρείκελονθεοείκελον</foreign> Plato means to suggest that Man is then
            most manlike when he most resembles God: and (as Tennyson says) &ldquo;then most
            godlike being most a man.&rdquo; Cf. IX 589 D note This sure and abiding conviction
            of the presence of a divine element within us, rendering our nature essentially and
            truly human, makes itself felt in nearly all the dialogues of Plato. It is the ultimate
            source of all his idealism, religious and metaphysical, no less than moral and
            political, and may well be considered the most precious and enduring inheritance which
            he has bequeathed to posterity.</p>

            corruption was far more likely. Plato means us to understand that God loves those most

            a departure from the MSS. <foreign lang="greek">ἐνέσονται</foreign> moreover is better

            how they will <hi rend="italic">be</hi> in the city, i.e. the whole subject of their
            position and standing in the State. It is this, as well as their education, which is
            described in the sequel. The present sentence is intended as a full and accurate
            forecast of the rest of VI and VII. <foreign lang="greek">Ξ</foreign> has <foreign lang="greek">ἔσονται</foreign>, which was read till Bekker restored <foreign lang="greek">ἐνέσονται</foreign>.</p>
          <p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">οὐδὲν κτλ.</lemma> Cf. 497 C, D notes There, as
            here, the <foreign lang="greek">κατάστασις τῶν ἀρχόντων</foreign> and the position
            of women and children etc. are treated as parts of one and the same question. The first
            obscure hint of this connexion is in IV 423 E, but it is not till V 471 C ff. that we
            begin to see the intimate relation between the two subjects. In V 450 C Socrates for the
            first time touches on the question &lsquo;Are our proposals about women&rsquo;
            etc. &lsquo;possible?&rsquo; The same question reappears in 471 C, but with a
            larger scope &lsquo;Is the perfect city possible as a whole?&rsquo; The reply is
            &lsquo;Yes, if Philosophers are Kings&rsquo;; and thus is re-opened the whole
            subject of the <foreign lang="greek">κατάστασις τῶν ἀρχόντων</foreign>. Plato is
            therefore justified in connecting, as he does, the two topics here mentioned. But he
            overstates the case when he asserts that the <foreign lang="greek">κατάστασις τῶν
              ἀρχόντων</foreign> has been omitted in Books III and IV (see III 412 B ff.), or
            slurred over in the same way as the Community of Wives and Children, in spite of various
            hints of a fuller treatment still to come (III 414 A: cf. IV 442 C note). See also on

            it is certainly even in outline incomplete. Cf. Krohn <title>Pl. St.</title> p. 126,
            where the case is somewhat overstated; and see on 497 C, 502 D. But there is nothing in

            met with considerable favour; but Schneider, Stallbaum, and J. and C. still retain
              <foreign lang="greek">ἄλλοις</foreign>. With the MS reading we must, I think,
            translate &lsquo;in the other cases&rsquo; i.e. in the <foreign lang="greek">πόνοι</foreign> etc. spoken of just before. (If Plato merely meant &lsquo;in
            other kinds of effort&rsquo; it was not worth his while to insert the clause at
            all.) But <foreign lang="greek">ὥσπερ</foreign> certainly suggests something more than
            a mere comparison between flinching at moral, and flinching at intellectual tests; and
            nothing could be more appropriate, or more in Plato's way, than an allusion to the
            games: see on V 465 D. That <foreign lang="greek">&lt;&gt;θλοι</foreign> in
            this sense is half-poetic, &ldquo;occurring only in the <title>Timaeus</title> and
            the <title>Laws</title>&rdquo; (J. and C.), is scarcely an objection in Plato.
              <foreign lang="greek">ἄθλοις</foreign> also suits well with <foreign lang="greek">γυμνάζειν</foreign>. In [<title>Axioch.</title>] 365 A occur the words <foreign lang="greek">ὡς γὰρ ἀγωνιστὴς δειλός, ἐν τοῖς γυμνασίοις γενναῖος

            Plut. <title>Them.</title> 11. 3.</p>
          <p>504A - 505B Glauco enquires what these &lsquo;greatest studies&rsquo; are. You
            will remember, says Socrates, that we described our earlier or psychological method of
            arriving at the Virtues as inadequate and incomplete. Our guardians must travel by a
            longer road, if they would reach their proper goal, i.e. the highest of all studies,
            which is something above and beyond even the virtues. And these very virtues must no
            longer be seen merely in outline; they must be studied in all their fulness and
            perfection. The highest study is the Idea of the Good, as Glauco has often heard before.
            It is the knowledge of this Idea which alone renders all other knowledge useful and
            profitable.</p>

            eject the word (with Madvig) or to write <foreign lang="greek">εἴη</foreign>: why
            should not the mood of the <hi rend="italic">oratio recta</hi> be retained? <foreign lang="greek">εἴη</foreign> would be unpleasing with <foreign lang="greek">εἴη</foreign> following so soon. Liebhold's <foreign lang="greek">ὡς μὲν δυνατὰ
              ᾖ</foreign> is unclassical: see on I 349 C. Richards conjectures <foreign lang="greek">ὡς μὲν &lt;ὡς</foreign>

              <foreign lang="greek">ὡς</foreign> with <foreign lang="greek">κατιδεῖν</foreign>.
            But we ought not to multiply instances of <foreign lang="greek">ὡς</foreign> for
              <foreign lang="greek">ὥστε</foreign> in Plato (II 365 D note). The infinitive means
            simply &lsquo;for descrying,&rsquo; &lsquo;in order to descry them in the
            best possible way&rsquo;: see Goodwin <title>MT.</title> p. 308 and K&uuml;hner

          <p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">αὐτά</lemma> is of course the four cardinal
            virtues, like <foreign lang="greek">ταῦτα</foreign> in 504 D. The &lsquo;longer
            circuit&rsquo; is the educational training necessary in order to enable the
            guardians to obtain scientific knowledge of the virtues by discerning their relation
            with the Idea of Good: cf. 506 A. In Book IV Justice, Temperance etc. were regarded as
            psychological qualities or relations; but the philosophic Guardians must learn their
            metaphysical import. Throughout the rest of VI and VII Plato, in short, discards
            Psychology for Metaphysics. Thus much is clear; but many difficult and interesting
            questions arise in connexion with this passage, as Krohn and others have pointed out.
            The <foreign lang="greek">μακροτέρα περίοδος</foreign> mentioned in IV 435 D appears
            to be a longer way of determining, not the essential nature of the virtues, but whether
            Soul has &lsquo;parts&rsquo; or not. (A <pb n="49"/> solution of this difficulty
            is suggested on 435 D). Socrates' shorter road, again, is not a way by which the
            Guardians are to go, but a method employed by himself in studying primarily the Soul,
            and secondarily the virtues. Finally, what is the relation between the psychological
            conception of Virtue and the metaphysical? And does the metaphysical conception involve
            a revised psychology or not? The last question is touched on in the notes to X 611 B,
            where Plato himself appears to raise it. For the last but one see on 504 D.</p>

              <foreign lang="greek">τὸ Πλάτωνος ἀγαθόν</foreign> was in antiquity a proverb for

            be presently named, I have found the monograph by Biehl <title>Die Idee des Guten bei
              Platon</title> Graz 1870 particularly good and useful. Other special treatises are
            also referred to in the course of the notes. The majority of interpreters are now agreed
            in identifying Plato's Idea of the Good with his philosophical conception of the Deity.
            The best and fullest proof of the identity is still, I think, Stumpf's exhaustive
            dissertation <hi rend="italic">Das Verh&auml;ltniss des Platonischen Gottes zur Idee
              des Guten</hi> Halle 1869. There is only one passage in his works where Plato himself
            appears expressly to identify the two, viz. <bibl n="Plat. Phileb. 22C"><title>Phil.</title> 22 C</bibl>, but on the principle that things which are equal to
            the same thing are equal to one another, the identification is complete, and I have
            therefore thought myself at liberty throughout the notes occasionally to illustrate
            Plato's metaphysics by his theology.</p>

            expected on some future occasion. But there is no dialogue in which the Idea of Good is
            so clearly described as in the <title>Republic</title>, and it is not without reason
            that every historian of Philosophy regards this passage as the <hi rend="italic">locus

            <foreign lang="greek">ἀγαθόν</foreign> p. 15) thinks of the <title>Philebus</title>;
            Susemihl (<title>Gen. Entw.</title> II p. 193) of the <foreign lang="greek">Φιλόσοφος</foreign>, which was perhaps planned, but probably never executed (see on
            484 A). The <title>Philebus</title> is unsuitable; and of the <foreign lang="greek">Φιλόσοφος</foreign> we know nothing. I am inclined to think&mdash;in view
            especially of <foreign lang="greek">βουλοίμην ἂν κτλ.</foreign> below&mdash;that,
            although Plato may have cherished the idea of describing the Good without the aid of a
              simile&mdash;<foreign lang="greek">εἴδεσιν αὐτοῖς δἰ
            αὐτῶν</foreign>&mdash;, he never, at all events in any of his dialogues, did so.
            In a certain sense, perhaps, the <title>Timaeus</title> describes the Good (see
            Archer-Hind's edition p. 27), but even there, we study the &lsquo;Father of
            all&rsquo; not in himself so much as in his works. I agree with Stumpf's conclusion
            (l.c. p. 75) that Plato could hardly have depicted the Idea of Good at all except by
            means of a comparison. Certainly nothing else could have made it equally clear; and, in
            point of fact, &lsquo;es wird nirgends Mehr gegeben&rsquo; (Stumpf, l.c. p. 59

          <p>508B - 509A So much for our similitude. The interpretation is as follows. The offspring
            and image of the Good is the Sun, whose relation to Sight and its objects is the same as
            that of the Good to Thought (<foreign lang="greek">νοῦς</foreign>) and the objects of
            Thought. The analogue of Light is Truth; as we cannot see without Light, so, where Truth
            is absent, we cannot know. The Idea of the Good is the source of Truth and Knowledge,
            although itself apprehended by Knowledge. As Light and Sight resemble the Sun, so Truth
            and Knowledge resemble the Good, but the Good is not identical with either, for it
            transcends both.</p>

            are involved: <figure/></p>
          <p>With regard to (2), Light has been variously interpreted as symbolizing the Idea of
            Good (Plotinus, as appears from XXIII 4), Reason (Steinhart, <title>Einleitung</title>
            pp. 212 ff.), and the Ideas (Susemihl <title>Gen. Entw.</title> II pp. 195 ff.). But the
            chiasmus in 508 E, 509 A (<foreign lang="greek">&lt;&gt;πιστήμην
              ὄψιν</foreign>) clearly establishes equation (2) as well as (6), and the entire
            simile is plunged in confusion if Light is equated with anything except Truth. Cf.
            Stumpf l.c. p. 60 notes and Biehl l.c. pp. 50&mdash;53. Plato means that as Light,
            coming from the Sun, enables colours to be seen, and the faculty of Sight to see, so
            Truth (or rather Trueness, as Bosanquet remarks), coming from the Good, enables the
            Ideas to be known, and the faculty of <foreign lang="greek">νοῦς</foreign> to know. It
            should be carefully noted that Truth (or its source, the Idea of Good) is not yet
            regarded as creating, but only as actualizing the faculty of Reason. The conception of
            the Good as the ultimate cause of all Existence follows later (509 B ff.): here it is
            represented only as the cause of Knowledge. See also on 490 B, 508 D (<foreign lang="greek">ὅταν μὲν κτλ.</foreign>). If we would grasp the full significance of
            Plato's comparison, we must not be content with the merely philosophical interpretation
            of Light, but remember also the many poetical and religious associations which attached
            themselves to such words as <foreign lang="greek">φῶς</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">φέγγος</foreign>, especially in the Mysteries: see Neil on <bibl n="Aristoph. Kn. 1319">Ar. <title>Knights</title> 1319</bibl>, Mommsen <title>Feste d.
              Stadt Athen</title> pp. 229 f., 238 f. and Hatch on <title>The influence of the
              Mysteries upon Christian usages</title> in his <title>Hibbert Lectures</title> pp.
            283&mdash;309. The prominent position occupied by Light in the half-religious,
            half-philosophical teaching of Plotinus (see Zeller^{3} III 2 pp. 498 f., 500 note 2,
            616 al.) may to a large extent be attributed to the elaboration and expansion of the
            mystical elements involved in Plato's simile, the whole of which, together with the
            similes of the Line and the Cave, is of the greatest importance for the history of
            Neoplatonism. Cf. also 508 A, B notes</p>

          <p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">οὐκ οὐσίας κτλ.</lemma> has occasioned a vast
            amount of discussion. Krohn boldly declares that &lsquo;Die <foreign lang="greek">ἰδέα τοῦ ἀγαθοῦ</foreign> ist keine Idee, denn sie hat keine <foreign lang="greek">οὐσία</foreign>, sondern es ist eine Macht, die mit unserer Denkweise
            nur als die Gottheit begriffen werden kann&rsquo; (<title>Pl. St.</title> p. 146).
            Fouill&eacute;e <title>La Philosophie de Platon</title> II p. 109 draws an
            over-subtle distinction between <foreign lang="greek">εἶναι</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">οὐσία</foreign>, holding that although the Good is not <foreign lang="greek">οὐσία</foreign>, it nevertheless is <foreign lang="greek">ὄν</foreign> (cf. VII 518 C). Others have suspected the text, O. Schneider, for
            example, proposing <foreign lang="greek">οὐ &lt;μόνον&gt; οὐσίας
            κτλ.</foreign> (<title>Versuch einer genet. Entw. d. Plat.</title>
            <foreign lang="greek">ἀγαθόν</foreign> p. 16). That the text is right, the balance
            with <foreign lang="greek">οὐ γένεσινὄντα</foreign> conclusively shews.
            The Sun, said Socrates, is the cause of <foreign lang="greek">γένεσις</foreign>, though
            not himself <foreign lang="greek">γένεσις</foreign>. Just so the Good is the cause of
              <foreign lang="greek">οὐσία</foreign>, though not itself <foreign lang="greek">οὐσία</foreign>, but (to use a Neoplatonic expression) <foreign lang="greek">ὑπερούσιος</foreign>. Plato's meaning is as follows. The Sun is not <foreign lang="greek">γένεσις</foreign> in the sense in which the objects which he produces
            are <foreign lang="greek">γιγνόμενα</foreign>. Yet in a certain sense he too is
              <foreign lang="greek">γένεσις</foreign>, for he is <foreign lang="greek">ὁρατός</foreign>: see VII 529 C ff. and <bibl n="Plat. Tim. 28B"><title>Tim.</title>
              28 B</bibl>. (Bosanquet cannot be right in denying that Plato regards the Sun as a
              <foreign lang="greek">γιγνόμενον</foreign>). As the cause of <foreign lang="greek">γένεσις</foreign>, we may, in fact, regard the Sun as the only true <foreign lang="greek">γένεσις</foreign>, for all <foreign lang="greek">γιγνόμενα</foreign>
            are derived from him. Similarly the Good is not <foreign lang="greek">οὐσία</foreign>
            in the sense in which the Ideas are <foreign lang="greek">οὐσίαι</foreign>; but in a
            higher sense it is the only true <foreign lang="greek">οὐσία</foreign>, for all
              <foreign lang="greek">οὐσίαι</foreign> are only specific determinations of the Good.
            The <foreign lang="greek">ὑπερουσιότης</foreign> of the Good is merely Plato's way of
            saying that the first Principle of all existence must itself be underived. See on
              <foreign lang="greek">ἀρχὴν ἀνυπόθετον</foreign> 510 B and cf. Biehl l.c. p. 62
            and Fouill&eacute;e l.c. II pp. 105&mdash;111, where the matter is very clearly
            explained. The doctrine of the <foreign lang="greek">ὑπερουσιότης</foreign> of the
            Highest afterwards became a cardinal point with the Neoplatonists: see Plotinus ap.

            fountain from which both Knowledge and Existence flow&mdash;in no cold and
            colourless ontological abstraction, like Being, but in that for which <foreign lang="greek">πᾶσα ἡ κτίσις συστενάζει καὶ συνωδίνει</foreign>

            similitude more fully. Let us take a line, and divide it into two unequal parts, to
            represent the objects of Sight and the objects of Thought respectively. If we further
            subdivide each part in the ratio of the original sections, we shall have four segments,
            representing, in order of clearness, (1) Images and the like, (2) so-called real things,
            (3) the objects of that intellectual method which descends from assumptions to a
            conclusion, using sensible objects as images or illustrations, (4) the objects of that
            intellectual method, which ascends from assumptions to an unassumed first principle,
            without making use of any sensible illustrations whatsoever, and thereafter descends to
            a conclusion. The third section represents the subjects investigated by the so-called
            &lsquo;Arts&rsquo; or mathematical sciences; the fourth is the sphere of
            Dialectic. The corresponding mental states are called by Socrates <foreign lang="greek">εἰκασία, πίστις, διάνοια</foreign>, and <foreign lang="greek">νόησις</foreign>.

            and pointless, and in view of the passage from the <title>Cratylus</title> there should
            be no doubt that Plato <hi rend="italic">more suo</hi> is merely scoffing at a
            well-known contemporary etymology. The reading <foreign lang="greek">οὐρανόν</foreign>&mdash;see cr. n.&mdash;would be fatal to Thompson's theory,
            but <foreign lang="greek">οὐρανοῦ</foreign> (which most MSS read) is more pointed and

            but there should be no question that Plato wrote <foreign lang="greek">ἄνισα</foreign>. If the line is bisected, all four segments are equal, and the
            elaborate proportions drawn in 510 A, 511 E, VII 534 A represent no corresponding
            relations between the different segments of the line. The inequality, as Schneider and
            Steinhart point out, is intended to represent the difference in <foreign lang="greek">σαφήνεια</foreign> or <foreign lang="greek">ἀλήθεια</foreign> between the <foreign lang="greek">δοξαστόν</foreign> (or <foreign lang="greek">ὁρατόν</foreign>) and the

            the <foreign lang="greek">νοητόν</foreign> should be represented by a longer segment.
            Others assign the larger part to the <foreign lang="greek">ὁρατόν</foreign>, as being
            the region of <foreign lang="greek">τὰ πολλά</foreign> (Plutarch l.c. and Espinas in
            his edition of Book VI), but the length of the two main segments should follow the
            primary and fundamental principle of Plato's classification. The relevant consideration

            A is right. Schneider (<title>Addit.</title> p. 51) refers to a dissertation by Mommsen
            published in 1842 as taking the view here advocated.</p>
          <p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ἐξ ὑποθέσεων</lemma>
            <foreign lang="greek">. ὑπόθεσις</foreign> is correctly defined in the Platonic
              <foreign lang="greek">ὅροι</foreign> (415 B) as <foreign lang="greek">ἀρχὴ
              ἀναπόδεικτος</foreign>, a starting-point which is not demonstrated, but taken for
            granted, assumed, postulated. The arithmetician, for example, <foreign lang="greek">ὑποτίθεται</foreign> the odd, the even, etc., i.e. assumes that his definition of
            odd, even, etc. is correct, and draws conclusions from his <foreign lang="greek">ὑπόθεσις</foreign> of the odd, the even, etc. by means of exclusively deductive
            reasoning: cf. H. Sidgwick in <title>J. Ph.</title> II p. 100. If we attack his <foreign lang="greek">ὑπόθεσις</foreign>, as Lucian for example does (<title>Hermot.</title>
            74, quoted by Stallbaum), he must, <hi rend="italic">qu&acirc;</hi> arithmetician,
            throw up the sponge, for the <foreign lang="greek">ὑποθέσεις</foreign> of the inferior
              <foreign lang="greek">νοητόν</foreign> can be demonstrated (or overthrown) only by
            Dialectic. Cf. generally <bibl n="Plat. Meno 86E"><title>Men.</title> 86 E</bibl> ff.
            Schneider may be right in supposing that Aristotle had the present passage in view when
            he wrote <foreign lang="greek">εὖ γὰρ καὶ Πλάτων ἠπόρει τοῦτο καὶ ἐζήτει,
              πότερον ἀπὸ τῶν ἀρχῶν ἢ ἐπὶ τὰς ἀρχάς ἐστιν ἡ ὁδός, ὥσπερ ἐν τῷ

              Nic.</title> I 2. 1095^{a} 32), though it is perhaps better (with Zeller^{4} II 1, p.

            quod excogitat animus), for the verb of the relative clause can hardly be omit<pb n="67"/> ted. <foreign lang="greek">λόγῳ</foreign>, once proposed by Hermann, has nothing in

          <p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ἀρχὴν ἀνυπόθετον</lemma>. The only <foreign lang="greek">ἀρχὴ ἀνυπόθετος</foreign> is the Idea of the Good: cf. VII 532 A f.
            Towards this the Dialectician travels, starting from <foreign lang="greek">ὑποθέσεις</foreign>. He may begin, for example, by &lsquo;assuming&rsquo; the
            &lsquo;just.&rsquo; In such a case he assumes that his definition of
            &lsquo;just&rsquo; is correct, i.e. corresponds exactly to the Idea of
            &lsquo;Just.&rsquo; But whereas the arithmetician treats his <foreign lang="greek">ὑπόθεσις</foreign> as an ultimate truth, and proceeds deductively to a
            conclusion, making use of sensible images by way of illustration, the dialectician
            treats his hypothesis as purely provisional, testing, revising, rejecting (VII 533 C
            note), and reconstructing, and gradually ascending step by step to the first principle
            of all (<foreign lang="greek">τὴν τοῦ παντὸς ἀρχήν</foreign>), without employing
            any sensible objects to illustrate his reasoning. The one gives no account of his
              <foreign lang="greek">ὑπόθεσις</foreign> (<foreign lang="greek">οὐδένα
              λόγονφανερῶν</foreign> in C below); the other not only does, but must do
            so, just because he <hi rend="italic">is</hi> a dialectician: cf. VII 533 C ff. He
            connects his <foreign lang="greek">ὑποθέσεις</foreign> with others, subsuming them
            under higher and yet higher &mdash;better and truer&mdash;<foreign lang="greek">ὑποθέσεις</foreign>, until at last he has traversed the whole region of <foreign lang="greek">νοητά</foreign>. Such of his <foreign lang="greek">ὑποθέσεις</foreign>
            as survive will be improved at each stage in the ascent, and finally, as soon as the
            Idea of Good is reached, all his surviving <foreign lang="greek">ὑποθέσεις</foreign>
            will actually have become perfect counterparts of the Ideas which they have hitherto
            been only <hi rend="italic">assumed</hi> to represent. In the meantime the <foreign lang="greek">ἀρχὴ τοῦ παντός</foreign>, which Plato himself described dogmatically
              <foreign lang="greek">δἰ εἰκόνος</foreign> in 507 A&mdash;509 C, will have
            ceased to be a mere <foreign lang="greek">ὑπόθεσις</foreign>: it will have become, in
            the fullest sense of the term, an <foreign lang="greek">ἀρχὴ ἀνυπόθετος</foreign>:
            for the highest rung of the ladder is not reached until the entire domain of the
            knowable has been exhausted, and shewn to be the expression of the Idea of Good. Plato's
            ideal&mdash;it is no more&mdash;is a comprehensive and purely intellectual view
            of the totality of <foreign lang="greek">νοητά</foreign>, in which every department is
            seen in its connexion with every other, and all in their dependence on the Good, which
            is in itself <foreign lang="greek">ἀνυπόθετος</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">ὑπερούσιοσἀνυπόθετος</foreign> because higher than all <foreign lang="greek">ὑποθέσεις</foreign> and itself proved by an exhaustive scrutiny of all
              <foreign lang="greek">νοητά, ὑπερούσιος</foreign> because higher than, and the
            cause of, all existence. See also on 511 B and the Appendix to Book VII <hi rend="italic">On Plato's Dialectic</hi>, together with Jackson <title>J. of

            here must not be held to imply that even the dialectician's conceptions of the Ideas are
            correct <hi rend="italic">before</hi> he has reached the Idea of the Good. Till then,
            they are only <foreign lang="greek">ὑποθέσεις</foreign>, though the false <foreign lang="greek">ὑποθέσεις</foreign> are weeded out (VII 533 C note), and the

            which&mdash;see App. I to Book VII&mdash;Plato holds to be <hi rend="italic">distinct</hi> from the Idea. But the ambiguity is resolved as soon as we are shewn
            (in 511 C ff.) how to interpret <foreign lang="greek">διανοούμενοι</foreign> and
              <foreign lang="greek">διανοίᾳ</foreign> (511 A), and we then see that Plato is here
            speaking of the <hi rend="italic">mathematical</hi> square. The singular <foreign lang="greek">τοῦ τετραγώνου</foreign> is generic (cf. <foreign lang="greek">ὁ
              σοφιστής</foreign> for the whole class of Sophists), for there are many
            &lsquo;mathematical&rsquo; squares, diagonals etc. (VII 526 A note and App. I to
            Book VII). It is conceivably for this reason that Plato drops the article with <foreign lang="greek">διαμέτρου</foreign> (&lsquo;a diagonal itself&rsquo;), thereby
            also getting a more precise antithesis to <foreign lang="greek">ἀλλ’ οὐ
            ταύτης</foreign>, or else (if this suggestion is hypercritical) <foreign lang="greek">διαμέτρου</foreign> is also generic. Sidgwick is, I think, mistaken when he says
              (<title>J. Ph.</title> II p. 103) that the language of this passage &ldquo;in no
            way supports the interpolation of intermediates (Aristotle's <foreign lang="greek">τὰ
              μεταξύ</foreign>) between particulars and Ideas&rdquo;: for <foreign lang="greek">διανοούμενοι</foreign> involves <foreign lang="greek">διάνοια</foreign>, and since
              <foreign lang="greek">διάνοια</foreign> is intermediate between <foreign lang="greek">νοῦς</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">δόξα</foreign> (511 D), we may reasonably
            suppose that its objects are likewise intermediate <pb n="69"/> between the higher
              <foreign lang="greek">νοητά</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">δοξαστά</foreign>.

          <p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ζητοῦντές τε</lemma>. Instead of <foreign lang="greek">τε</foreign>, I formerly read <foreign lang="greek">δέ</foreign> (on
            slight MS authority), with Ast and Stallbaum; but the corruption of <foreign lang="greek">δέ</foreign> to <foreign lang="greek">τε</foreign> is exceedingly
            improbable here. The antithetical force of the clause <foreign lang="greek">ζητοῦντεσἰδεῖν</foreign> is weakened by the occurrence of the words
              <foreign lang="greek">ὡς εἰκόσιν αὖ</foreign> in the <foreign lang="greek">μέν</foreign> clause. If the objects in question are used as images, the further
            statement that the real object of investigation is their originals (<foreign lang="greek">αὐτὰ ἐκεῖνα</foreign>) loses its antithetical force, and becomes a
            sort of adjunct. Hence <foreign lang="greek">τε</foreign> following <foreign lang="greek">ζητοῦντες</foreign> is more appropriate than <foreign lang="greek">αὐτὰ δὲ ἐκεῖνα ζητοῦντες ἰδεῖν</foreign>, which would be the natural way of

            Schneider), but rather &ldquo;the impersonal reason, or drift of the

            &lsquo;faculty,&rsquo; but simply &lsquo;power&rsquo; (cf. 508 E note):
            the argument, unaided by <foreign lang="greek">εἰκόνες</foreign> (<foreign lang="greek">αὐτός</foreign> &lsquo;by itself,&rsquo; cf. <foreign lang="greek">αὐτοῖς εἴδεσι</foreign> 510 B note), grasps its object by the
            inherent power of dialectical argumentation (<foreign lang="greek">διαλέγεσθαι</foreign>), and nothing else. In spite of Grimmelt (<hi rend="italic">de
              reip. unit.</hi> etc. p. 52) it is certainly an error to identify <foreign lang="greek">ὁ λόγος</foreign> with <foreign lang="greek">νοῦς</foreign>. Why does
            Dialectic dispense with all sensible images or illustrations? Plato (it should be
            remembered) holds that the intrusion of any element of sense-perception, however small,
            impedes the exercise of thought: see <bibl n="Plat. Phaedo 79C"><title>Phaed.</title> 79
              C</bibl> ff. The <foreign lang="greek">ὑποθέσεις</foreign> of the dialectician may
            be and often are generalisations from <foreign lang="greek">αἰσθητά</foreign>, but a
            generalisation, regarded in itself, is wholly <foreign lang="greek">νοητόν</foreign>.
            These <foreign lang="greek">ὑποθέσεις</foreign> it is the province of Dialectic to
            test in every possible way, to demolish where necessary (VII 533 C note), to correct by
            one another, to classify according to their mutual coherence and interdependence, until
            by an exhaustive scrutiny of all <foreign lang="greek">νοητά</foreign> we grasp the
            unifying principle of all existence&mdash;the Idea of the Good. Cf. VII 517 C note
            and see on <foreign lang="greek">τοῦ ἀνυποθέτου</foreign> below and the Appendix to

          <p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">τοῦ ἀνυποθέτου</lemma>. See on <foreign lang="greek">ἀρχὴν ἀνυπόθετον</foreign> 510 B. Plato makes no attempt in the
              <title>Republic</title> to classify Ideas in such an ascending scale as he here
            suggests, though it is probable from 509 A that Knowledge and Truth would rank near to
            the Good. Nor is there any dialogue in which an exhaustive classification is even
            attempted. Such hints as Plato gives us throughout his writings are enumerated in Stumpf
              <hi rend="italic">das Verh&auml;ltniss</hi> etc. pp. 50, 56, 76, and in Zeller^{4}
            II 1, pp. 704&mdash;707: cf. also Fouill&eacute;e <title>La Philosophie de
              Platon</title> II pp. 99&mdash;104. We must suppose that each higher Idea will
            excel all the lower both in range and in excellence. These two characteristics are, from
            Plato's point of view, the same. The wider an Idea is in range and extension, the
            greater will be the sum of existences of which it is the cause. But the Idea of Good is
            the cause of all existence, so that each higher Idea will be better than all below it,
            because it contains more of <pb n="71"/> Good. Beyond this it is perhaps safer not to
            go. A systematic attempt to correlate all intelligibles among themselves and in their
            connexion with the Good would have been premature in Plato's day, and is premature
            still. The permanent value of Plato's conception lies in the ideal which it sets before
            every succeeding generation of investigators.</p>
          <p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">πάλιν αὖ κτλ.</lemma> The dialectician's progress
            involves both an ascent and a descent&mdash;an ascent <foreign lang="greek">ἐπὶ
              τὴν ἀρχήν</foreign>, and a descent <foreign lang="greek">ἀπὸ τῆς ἀρχῆς ἐπὶ
              τὴν τελευτήν</foreign> (cf. Aristotle quoted on 510 B). By the time that he reaches
            the Idea of the Good, all his surviving <foreign lang="greek">ὑποθέσεις</foreign> have
            become exact counterparts of the Ideas which are their objective correlates; the others
            have all of them been demolished (VII 533 C note). The conclusions (<foreign lang="greek">τελευταί</foreign>) of dialectic are therefore impregnable; <foreign lang="greek">ψευδὴς ἐπιστήμη</foreign> is a contradiction in terms (V 477 E note).

            greater (according to Plato) is the amount of truth or knowability which its
            subjectmatter contains. Plato's theory on this subject is the source of Aristotle's

            his innovation by etymology, hinting that the word <foreign lang="greek">διάνοια</foreign> is by derivation that which is between (<foreign lang="greek">διὰ
              μέσου</foreign>) <foreign lang="greek">νοῦς</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">δόξα</foreign>. So also J. and C. Cf. <foreign lang="greek">εἰκασία</foreign>

            &lsquo;seeing,&rsquo; as we still say, &lsquo;is believing.&rsquo; But
            Plato has already spoken of <title>AC</title> as <foreign lang="greek">δοξαστόν</foreign> (510 A note); so that <foreign lang="greek">πίστις</foreign>
            should not be confined to the objects of sight. It is in fact a subdivision of <foreign lang="greek">δόξα</foreign>, superior in point of &lsquo;clearness&rsquo;
              (<foreign lang="greek">σαφήνεια</foreign>) to <foreign lang="greek">εἰκασία</foreign>. We may regard it as the normal condition of the average uneducated
            mind. <foreign lang="greek">εἰκασία</foreign> is the state of mind in which <foreign lang="greek">εἰκόνες</foreign> are held to be true. Here again, if <foreign lang="greek">εἰκόνες</foreign> are strictly limited to images of <foreign lang="greek">ὁρατά</foreign> (cf. 509 E, 510 A), <foreign lang="greek">εἰκασία</foreign> must be similarly confined in its scope, and loses all metaphysical
            interest and importance: see VII 517 A note But since the <foreign lang="greek">εἰκόνες</foreign> are a lower grade of <foreign lang="greek">δοξαστά</foreign>
            (510 A note), <foreign lang="greek">εἰκασία</foreign> should be understood as a lower
            variety of <foreign lang="greek">δόξα</foreign> (as in VII 534 A), viz. the state of
            mind which accepts as true that which is a copy of a copy (<foreign lang="greek">τρίτον
              πρὸς ἀλήθειαν</foreign>). In this sense <foreign lang="greek">εἰκασία</foreign>
            (with a play on <foreign lang="greek">εἰκόνες</foreign>) is a new coinage of Plato's.
            The translation &lsquo;conjecture&rsquo; is misleading, for conjecture implies
            conscious doubt or hesitation, and doubt is foreign to <foreign lang="greek">εἰκασία</foreign> in Plato's sense. Plato may however have intended to suggest that
            such a state of mind is in reality no better than conjecture. See also X 598 A note and

          <p>514A - 517A The following comparison represents our nature in respect of education and
            the absence thereof. Let us imagine a number of prisoners confined in a subterranean
            cave, and unable to see anything except shadows of images and other such objects, cast
            by the light of a fire. Such men will believe that shadows of manufactured things are
            the only truth. If they are released, and led up step by step towards the light, they
            will turn and flee back into the cave; but if we compel them to emerge, they will
            gradually grow accustomed to the brightness, and be able to gaze upon the Sun and
            understand his sovereignty in the domain of visible things. Pity for their former
            friends will then begin to mingle with joy at their own escape. Should they redescend
            into their former place, the darkness will at first affect their vision, and expose them
            to the laughter of the others, who will, it may be, lay hands upon their deliverer and
            slay him.</p>
          <p>ff. The simile of the Cave presents us with a picture of the life of the uneducated man
              (<foreign lang="greek">τὴν ἡμετέραν φύσιν παιδείας τε πέρι καὶ
            ἀπαιδευσίας</foreign> 514 A: cf. also 515 A). From this point of view it should be
            compared with <bibl n="Plat. Theaet. 172C"><title>Theaet.</title> 172 C</bibl>
            &mdash;177 C, and (in spite of the different situation) with <bibl n="Plat. Phaedo 109A"><title>Phaed.</title> 109 A</bibl>&mdash;E, where the
            equation is:&mdash;Depths of Ocean : Hollows of Earth=Hollows of Earth : The true
            Earth. Plato bids us connect the Cave with the Line (517 A), and does so himself (l.c.,
            and 532 C). We have seen that the lower segment of the line (<title>AC</title>) is
            spoken of sometimes as <foreign lang="greek">ὁρατόν</foreign>, sometimes as <foreign lang="greek">δοξαστόν</foreign> (VI 510 B note). Plato does not even now distinguish
            between the two terms; and since the <foreign lang="greek">ἀπαίδευτος</foreign> is
            concerned with <foreign lang="greek">τὸ δοξαστόν</foreign> in general rather than with
              <foreign lang="greek">τὸ ὁρατόν</foreign> exclusively, we shall best apprehend
            Plato's meaning if we interpret the simile by the following proportion:&mdash;Cave :

            <hi rend="italic">s.</hi>

            <foreign lang="greek">ὁρατόν</foreign> : <foreign lang="greek">νοητόν</foreign>. See

          <p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ἰδὲ γὰρ κτλ.</lemma> Empedocles spoke of the
            terrestrial region as a cave (<foreign lang="greek">ἠλύθομεν τόδ’ ὑπ’ ἄντρον
              ὑπόστεγον</foreign> 31 ed. Karsten), and similar expressions occur in the Orphic
            verses e.g. <foreign lang="greek">ταῦτα πατὴρ ποίησε κατὰ σπέος
            ἠεροειδές</foreign> (ap. Procl. <hi rend="italic">in Tim.</hi> 95 D): see Rohde
              <title>Psyche</title>^{2} II p. 178 note and Dieterich <title>Nekyia</title> p. 159
            note There is however nothing to shew that Plato borrowed the underlying idea, much less
            the details, of his simile from any previous writer: for the metaphorical application of
              <foreign lang="greek">ἄνω, ὑψόθεν</foreign> and kindred words in connexion with
            true <foreign lang="greek">παιδεία</foreign> is a favourite usage of Plato's (cf. <bibl n="Plat. Theaet. 175B"><title>Theaet.</title> 175 B</bibl>, <bibl n="Plat. Soph. 216C"><title>Soph.</title> 216 C</bibl>, <bibl n="Plat. Phaedo 109A"><title>Phaed.</title> 109 A</bibl> ff.), and the simile might easily have been
            elaborated from such a metaphor. For a strikingly eloquent imitation see Cic. <hi rend="italic">de nat. deor.</hi> II 95 (translated from Aristotle: see
            <title>Frag.</title> 14. 1476^{a} 34 ff.). With the life of the cave-dwellers Bosanquet
            aptly compares the account of uncivilized humanity in <bibl n="Aesch. PB 447">Aesch.
                <title>Prom.</title> 447</bibl>&mdash;453. A kindred though not identical figure
            is employed in Fitzgerald's Omar Khayya/m LXVIII: &ldquo;We are no other than a
            moving row Of magic Shadow-shapes that come and go Round with the Sun-illumined Lantern

          <p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ἀναπεπταμένην κτλ.</lemma> Herwerden suspects
            corruption, on the ground that the cave is dark, except for the light of the fire. But
            unless the <hi rend="italic">entrance</hi> to the cave is open to the light of day, how
            are the prisoners ever to emerge, as they ultimately do (515 E)? The <foreign lang="greek">εἴσοδος</foreign> is long (<foreign lang="greek">μακρά</foreign>) and
            steep (515 E), so that the daylight cannot reach the cave in any case. Prantl is right,
            I think, in understanding <foreign lang="greek">μακράν</foreign> of <hi rend="italic">length</hi> and not width, although Schneider and the English translators apparently
            hold the other view. See next note.</p>
          <p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">παρ’ ἅπαν τὸ σπήλαιον</lemma> should (I believe)
            be taken separately from <foreign lang="greek">μακράν</foreign>. The words define the
              <hi rend="italic">width</hi> of the entrance, which is &lsquo;along the whole
            of,&rsquo; i.e. &lsquo;as wide as,&rsquo; the cave. The reason will appear
            later: see on <foreign lang="greek">ὅρα τοίνυν</foreign> 514 B. The translation
            &ldquo;extending along the entire length of the cavern&rdquo; (D. and V.) seems
            to render <foreign lang="greek">μακράν</foreign> altogether otiose. See Fig. ii on p.

            emendation, which Cobet approves and Hermann and others adopt, I now think right.
              <foreign lang="greek">μένειν</foreign> is not, I believe, used absolutely in the
            sense of <foreign lang="greek">μένειν αὐτοῦ</foreign>, which is the meaning required
            here. It might be possible to understand <foreign lang="greek">μένειν</foreign> as
            equivalent to <foreign lang="greek">μένειν ἀκινήτους</foreign>, in view of <bibl n="Plat. Crat. 426E"><title>Crat.</title> 426 E</bibl> and <bibl n="Plat. Phaedrus 261D"><title>Phaedr.</title> 261 D</bibl>, but &lsquo;remain
            motionless&rsquo; is not quite suitable in point of sense. Still less does the
            possible rendering &lsquo;remain by themselves&rsquo; fit the situation. On the
            other hand <foreign lang="greek">μένειν τε αὐτοῦ</foreign> &lsquo;remain where
            they are,&rsquo; &lsquo;remain in one place&rsquo; (cf. I 327 C, II 371 C),
            corresponds exactly to <foreign lang="greek">ἐν δεσμοῖς τὰ σκέλη</foreign>, just as
              <foreign lang="greek">εἴς τε τὸ πρόσθεν μόνον ὁρᾶν</foreign> echoes <foreign lang="greek">ἐν δεσμοῖς τοὺς αὐχένας</foreign>. The <foreign lang="greek">τετε</foreign> after <foreign lang="greek">καὶκαί</foreign>
            suggests that Plato intended this correspondence. There is nothing to be said for
            Herwerden's proposal to insert <foreign lang="greek">ἀκινήτους</foreign>.</p>

            is no improvement. The word, like <foreign lang="greek">ὄντας</foreign>, depends of
            course on <foreign lang="greek">ἰδέ</foreign>. For <foreign lang="greek">καόμενον</foreign>, Hirschig, with Cobet's approval, conjectures <foreign lang="greek">καομένου</foreign>, and so Baiter also reads: but <foreign lang="greek">καομένου</foreign> leaves <foreign lang="greek">αὐτοῖς</foreign> out in the cold.

            (so also Schneider): it should not be taken with <foreign lang="greek">ὁδόν</foreign>
            in the sense of a &lsquo;raised way&rsquo; (Jowett). There is no reason why the
              <foreign lang="greek">ὁδός</foreign> should be raised above the level of the ground,
            and it is unnecessarily harsh to construe the adverb with the noun. The fact that verbal
            nouns occasionally take an adverb in Plato (see on IV 434 C) does not justify Jowett's

            without further specification, stand for the spectators, and no further specification is

            The low wall which crosses the <foreign lang="greek">εἴσοδος</foreign> at a point
            between the prisoners and the fire intercepts the shadows of the <foreign lang="greek">παραφέροντες</foreign>: but the <foreign lang="greek">σκεύη</foreign> which they
            carry, presumably on their heads, overtop the wall, and are reflected on the wall of the
            cave in front of the prisoners. See Fig. ii on p. 65. Plato adopts various devices in
            order to suggest a due proportion between the objects inside and outside the cave in
            point of reality. Thus (1) the typical examples <foreign lang="greek">ἀνδριάντες</foreign> etc. are themselves images of the natural objects of the
            superior <foreign lang="greek">ὁρατόν</foreign>: (2) the originals of the Cave are all
            (except the prisoners themselves 515 A) <foreign lang="greek">σκευαστά</foreign>,
            whereas those of the superior <foreign lang="greek">ὁρατόν</foreign> are
            &mdash;primarily speaking&mdash;<foreign lang="greek">φυτευτά</foreign> (for
            the significance of this see 532 C note): (3) the contents of the Cave, both originals
            and shadows, may be regarded as less luminous and true than the <foreign lang="greek">ὁρατά</foreign> outside, because they derive their light and truth, not from the
            Sun, but from an artificial Fire (see also on 517 C). The interpretation of the simile
            is to be sought in the <foreign lang="greek">δοξαστόν</foreign> generally as well as in
            the <foreign lang="greek">ὁρατόν</foreign> in particular (see on 517 A), but we need
            not suppose that every detail is significant. Comparisons have been made between the
              <foreign lang="greek">παραφέροντες</foreign> and (in the <foreign lang="greek">ὁρατόν</foreign>) <foreign lang="greek">δαίμονες</foreign> (Campbell II p. 16,
            comparing <title>Tim.</title> 43), or (in the <foreign lang="greek">δοξαστόν</foreign>)
            Sophists etc. (Shorey, <title>Idea of Good</title> etc. p. 238). The latter analogy is
            the more fruitful, but neither of them is altogether free from difficulty, and Plato may
            have intended the <foreign lang="greek">παραφέροντες</foreign> only as part of the
            machinery of his similitude. If the Cave is to represent the world of <foreign lang="greek">τὰ πολλά</foreign>, it must have a semblance of life and motion; and
            without the <foreign lang="greek">παραφέροντες</foreign> the shadows would be
            motionless and dead.</p>

            <foreign lang="greek">παριόντα</foreign> (or <foreign lang="greek">παραφερόμενα</foreign>): therefore (<foreign lang="greek">οὖν</foreign>) they

            shadow of a table &lsquo;a table,&rsquo; and in so doing they are, without
            knowing it, naming, not, as they suppose, the shadow, but the substance. J. and C.
            remark that &ldquo;<foreign lang="greek">παριόντα</foreign> is rather confusing as
            it might signify either the shadows&rdquo; (cf. 516 C) &ldquo;or the

          <p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">εἰ φύσει τοιάδε κτλ.</lemma>
            <foreign lang="greek"> φύσει</foreign> has been variously interpreted as follows. (1)
              &lsquo;<foreign lang="greek">φύσει</foreign> est revera&rsquo; (Ast,
            Stallbaum): (2) &lsquo;si res et natura ferret,&rsquo; &lsquo;in the course
            of nature&rsquo; (Schneider, J. and C., D. and V.): (3) &lsquo;<foreign lang="greek">φύσει</foreign>, no one knows how&rsquo; (Nettleship <title>Lect.
              and Rem.</title> II p. 260). None of these explanations is either linguistically easy
            or altogether suitable in point of meaning. It should be remembered that the condition
            of the prisoners, shut out as they are from light and truth amid the darkness of the
            Cave, is &lsquo;unnatural&rsquo; (<foreign lang="greek">παρὰ φύσιν</foreign>)
            in the Platonic sense of the word (see IV 443 B note). Their release is therefore a
            return to their true nature, and may for this reason be described as
            &lsquo;natural.&rsquo; This, I think, is what Plato means to suggest by <foreign lang="greek">φύσει</foreign>. It is true, as we are presently told (515 E <foreign lang="greek">βίᾳ</foreign>), that force has to be employed in order to drag the
            prisoners on high; but their deliverance is none the less &lsquo;natural&rsquo;
            in Plato's way of thinking. Schleiermacher and Herwerden wish to read <foreign lang="greek">οἵα τις ἂν εἴη φύσει, εἰ τοιάδε κτλ.</foreign> The fact that
              <foreign lang="greek">εἰ</foreign> was omitted by A^{1}, and is absent from five
            other MSS, may appear to favour this conjecture. We might suppose that <foreign lang="greek">εἰ</foreign> fell out by <foreign lang="greek">ὁμοιοτέλευτον</foreign>
            after <foreign lang="greek">φύσει</foreign>, disappeared altogether from several MSS,
            and was wrongly replaced in A. (The evidence of <foreign lang="greek">Π</foreign> is
            unfortunately wanting here.) But on this view it is difficult to see what <foreign lang="greek">φύσει</foreign> adds to <foreign lang="greek">οἵα τις ἂν
            εἴη</foreign>, and for this and other reasons I prefer the solution which I have

            Plato is thinking chiefly of the empirical politician and political adviser, who
            foretells the future from the present and the past (cf. Thuc. I 22), but limits his
            intellectual horizon by his own experience, and knows nothing of the real determining

            1, pp. 223&mdash;227 and cf. VI 496 C, D notes Read in the light of another and even
            more momentous sacrifice, the sentence assumes a kind of prophetical import, like the
            famous passage about the <foreign lang="greek">λόγος θεῖος</foreign> in the
              <title>Phaedo</title> (85 C, D). See Geddes's <title>Phaedo of Plato</title> pp.
            280&mdash;283. The text is difficult to determine. If we retain <foreign lang="greek">λαβεῖν καὶ ἀποκτείνειν, ἀποκτιννύναι ἄν</foreign>, we must either
            a regard <foreign lang="greek">ἆρ’ οὐ λέγοιτ’ ἄν</foreign> as
            equivalent to <foreign lang="greek">ἆρ’ οὐκ οἴει γέλωτ’ ἂν αὐτὸν παρασχεῖν
              καὶ λέγεσθαι ἄν</foreign>, and take <foreign lang="greek">λέγεσθαι ἄν</foreign>
            as equivalent to <foreign lang="greek">ἐκείνους ἂν εἰπεῖν</foreign>, carrying on
              <foreign lang="greek">ἐκείνους</foreign> as subject to <foreign lang="greek">ἀποκτιννύναι ἄν</foreign> (Schneider), or b supply <foreign lang="greek">οὐκ
              οἴει</foreign>, although these words do not occur after 516 C (J. and C.). The
            second solution is preferable to the first, but either is a <hi rend="italic">tour de
              force.</hi> No satisfactory explanation of the infinitive <foreign lang="greek">ἀποκτιννύναι ἄν</foreign> appears to be possible, and the immediate juxtaposition
            of the two forms of the infinitive is also in itself suspicious. A few inferior MSS read
              <foreign lang="greek">ἀποκτενεῖν</foreign> for the <foreign lang="greek">ἀποκτείνειν</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">αὖ</foreign> for the <foreign lang="greek">ἄν</foreign> of A: but otherwise there is no important variant. The
            emendations proposed are (1) <foreign lang="greek">λαβεῖν, κἂν
            ἀποκτείνειαν</foreign> (Ast), (2) <foreign lang="greek">λαβεῖν, καὶ ἀποκτείνοιεν
              ἄν</foreign> (Stallbaum), (3) <foreign lang="greek">λαβεῖν, κἂν
            ἀποκτιννύοιεν</foreign> (Cobet), (4) <foreign lang="greek">λαβεῖν, καὶ
              ἀποκτείνειαν ἄν</foreign> (Baiter). The correction in the text appears to me not
            only easier, but more in harmony with Plato's fulness of expression. I suppose that the
            error arose thus. A scribe accidentally omitted <foreign lang="greek">ἀποκτιννύναι</foreign>, and the infinitive was wrongly replaced after, instead of
            before, <foreign lang="greek">ἀποκτείνειαν</foreign>. This would give <foreign lang="greek">λαβεῖν καὶ ἀποκτείνειαν, ἀποκτιννύναι ἄν</foreign>, from which
            the change is inevitable to the text of A.</p>
          <p>517A - 518B The simile of the Cave should be connected with the Line. The Cave is the
            visible world, the fire is the Sun, and the prisoners' journey towards the light
            resembles the ascent of the soul into the intelligible sphere, in which the Idea of Good
            reigns supreme. We need not wonder that the philosopher is unwilling to leave the light
            of thought for the darkness of practical affairs, or that he is dazed and confused when
            he does.</p>
          <p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ταύτην κτλ.</lemma> If we interpret the lower
            section of the line as <foreign lang="greek">ὁρατόν</foreign> and nothing more, the
            following comparisons are involved:&mdash;(1) Fire=Sun: (2) Shadows of <foreign lang="greek">ἀνδριάντες</foreign> and other <foreign lang="greek">σκευαστά</foreign> cast by Fire = Shadows etc. of <foreign lang="greek">φυτευτά</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">σκευαστά</foreign> cast by the Sun: (3)

            the ascent from the Cave into the <foreign lang="greek">ὁρατόν</foreign>=the ascent
            from the <foreign lang="greek">ὁρατόν</foreign> into the <foreign lang="greek">νοητόν</foreign>. The second comparison is of little or no importance, for the
              <foreign lang="greek">ἀπαίδευτος</foreign>, of whose condition the Cave is an
            allegory, does not contemplate exclusively or even principally natural shadows of
              <foreign lang="greek">φυτευτά</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">σκευαστά</foreign>
            (cf. VI 511 E note). Nor do the other comparisons exhaust the significance of the Cave
            as an allegory of <foreign lang="greek">ἀπαιδευσία</foreign>. In order fully to
            apprehend its meaning, we must regard the lower section of the line as <foreign lang="greek">δοξαστόν</foreign> in the sense of V 475 E ff. Plato himself does so:
            see VI 510 A note The shadows and originals within the cave will then symbolise <foreign lang="greek">δόξαι</foreign> which are respectively twice and once removed from the
            truth which they seek to portray (see on 517 D), and the ascent from the Cave into the
              <foreign lang="greek">ὁρατόν</foreign> will represent the soul's ascent from the
              <foreign lang="greek">δοξαστόν</foreign> into the <foreign lang="greek">νοητόν</foreign>&mdash;from the <foreign lang="greek">πολλά</foreign> (in the

            &lsquo;images&rsquo; of justice) by a rhetorician or pleader&rdquo;

          <p>518B - 521B It follows that Education is not a way of putting knowledge into empty
            souls, but a revolution of the Reason or organ of Knowledge, whose gaze must be directed
            upon Being and the brightest part thereof, which is the Good. The entire soul turns
            round along with Reason in this revolution. Other virtues are secondary and
            adventitious, but Reason never loses its power, and works weal or woe, according as it
            is or is not converted by means of Education. The best natures in our city, after they
            have ascended to the Good, must rejoin the prisoners whom they have left. To force them
            thus to redescend, may seem unjust; but Law seeks to make the whole city prosperous
            rather than a single class. And indeed it is also just that they should thus repay their
            country for having reared and educated them. They will themselves admit the force of our
            demands, and take their turn in the work of government, not eagerly, but as a necessity.
            We have seen that a well governed city is impossible unless a life better than that of
            ruling is open to its rulers, and the life of true philosophy is better.</p>
          <p>ff. Nothing that Plato has bequeathed to us is more valuable than his theory of
            education as developed in this part of the <title>Republic</title>, and there is
            probably nothing in the whole range of educational literature, ancient or modern, which
            takes so far-reaching and profound a view of the aim and scope of education, or is so
            well fitted to inspire the teacher with indomitable courage and inextinguishable hope.

            to put <foreign lang="greek">ἐπιστήμη</foreign> into the soul; but Plato's argument
            indicates that the power or faculty of <foreign lang="greek">ἐπιστήμη</foreign>
              (<foreign lang="greek">ταύτην τὴν δύναμιν</foreign>), and its organ <foreign lang="greek">νοῦς</foreign> are <hi rend="italic">already</hi> present in the soul of

            prisoners in the cave. <foreign lang="greek">νοῦς</foreign> is in fact the <foreign lang="greek">θεῖόν τι ἐν ἡμῖν</foreign>, according to Plato, through whose
            indwelling man is most truly man by being like to God (VI 501 B, IX 589 D notes). The
            doctrine that <foreign lang="greek">μάθησις</foreign> is <foreign lang="greek">ἀνάμνησις</foreign> implies what is fundamentally the same view: see
            <title>Meno</title> 81 A ff. and <bibl n="Plat. Phaedo 72E"><title>Phaed.</title> 72
            E</bibl>&mdash;76 D, especially 73 A <foreign lang="greek">ἐρωτώμενοι οἱ

            Plato's conception of the divine element in man is the ultimate basis of all his proofs
            of Immortality. In its deeper bearings, therefore, the view of education here presented
            is incomparably grander and more profound than the usual connotation of the word either
            in ancient or in modern times. We educate our pupils not only for time, but for
            eternity, and therefore <foreign lang="greek">πείρας οὐδὲν ἀνήσομεν, ἕως ἂν ἢ

              ἔχουσα εἰς Αἵδου ἡ ψυχὴ ἔρχεται πλὴν τῆς παιδείας τε καὶ τροφῆς
            κτλ.</foreign> Michael Angelo used to say that every block of marble contained a statue,
            and that the sculptor brings it to light by cutting away the encumbrances by which the
            &lsquo;human face divine&rsquo; is concealed. In like manner, according to
            Plato, it is the business of the teacher to prune the soul of his pupil of those
            unnatural excrescences and incrustations which hide its true nature (519 A, B note),
            until the human <hi rend="italic">soul</hi> divine (VI 501 B note) stands out in all its
            pristine grace and purity. It should carefully be noted that in Plato's theory of
            education the entire soul is involved (<foreign lang="greek">ξὺν ὅλῃ τῇ
            ψυχῇ</foreign>). The Platonic <foreign lang="greek">περιαγωγή</foreign>, although, or
            rather, perhaps, because, it applies primarily and immediately to the intellect, effects
            a moral no less than an intellectual revolution. The moral discipline of Books
            II&mdash;IV, so far from being overthrown, is strengthened and consolidated by being

              <foreign lang="greek">ὄργανον</foreign> round. Hence he concludes (<foreign lang="greek">τοίνυν</foreign>) Education is not (as the Sophists say) an art of
            putting sight into the soul's eye (<foreign lang="greek">τοῦ ἐμποιῆσαι αὐτῷ τὸ
              ὁρᾶν</foreign> refers to <foreign lang="greek">τυφλοῖς ὀφθαλμοῖς ὄψιν
              ἐντιθέντες</foreign>), but an art of turning round just this very eye or <foreign lang="greek">ὄργανον</foreign> which is present in every soul from the first. The
            prevailing view since Schneider regards <foreign lang="greek">τούτου αὐτοῦ</foreign>
            as anticipating and explained by, not as depending on, <foreign lang="greek">τῆς
              περιαγωγῆς</foreign>. This yields a tolerable sense, but makes it difficult to supply
            the subject of <foreign lang="greek">μεταστραφήσεται</foreign>, and <foreign lang="greek">αὐτῷ</foreign> is also awkward. On Ast's view <foreign lang="greek">τίνα μεταστραφήσεται</foreign> explains <foreign lang="greek">τούτου
              αὐτοῦ τῆς περιαγωγῆς</foreign>, and the subject of <foreign lang="greek">μεταστραφήσεται</foreign> as well as the antecedent of <foreign lang="greek">αὐτῷ</foreign> is at once seen to be <foreign lang="greek">τὸ ὄργανον ᾧ
              καταμανθάνει ἕκαστος</foreign>, for it is identical with the antecedent of <foreign lang="greek">τούτου αὐτοῦ</foreign>.</p>
          <p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">τοῦ ἐμποιῆσαι κτλ.</lemma> The genitive has been

            they do not belong to soul essentially and from the first. Krohn (<title>Pl. St.</title>

            quite lose The divine property of her first being&rdquo; (<title>Comus</title> 464
            ff.). Through the weight of these encumbrances the eye of the soul is turned down (cf.
            IX 586 A <foreign lang="greek">κάτω ἀεὶ βλέποντες καὶ κεκυφότες εἰς γῆν καὶ
              εἰς τραπέζας κτλ.</foreign>), nor can the soul look upwards until they are knocked
            away (<foreign lang="greek">περιεκόπη</foreign>: cf. <foreign lang="greek">περικρουσθεῖσα</foreign> in X 611 E). We may again compare the lines of Milton
            &ldquo;Mammon, the least erected spirit that fell From Heaven; for e'en in Heaven
            his looks and thoughts Were always downward bent&rdquo; (<title>Par. Lost</title> I

            can hardly (with J. and C.) suppose that the allusion is to Heracles, Pollux etc., for
            Heracles' descent to Hades was an incident which happened long before his ascent to
            Heaven; and Pollux's life among the gods was intermittent. Cf. Schneider in his
            translation p. 304 note 187. Schneider himself suggests that Plato is thinking of
            legends about e.g. Aesculapius' deliverance from Hades, after Zeus had smitten him (cf.
            III 408 C and Roscher's <title>Lexicon d. Mythologie</title> I p. 620), and others have
            thought of Briareos and the <foreign lang="greek">ἑκατόγχειροι</foreign>: see
              <title>Il.</title> I 402&mdash;405 and cf. Hes. <title>Theog.</title>
            617&mdash;721. Mr Walter Headlam has pointed out to me that Semele was also raised
            from Hades to Heaven, citing Paus. II 31. 2 and ib. 37. 5: cf. also Plut. l.c. <foreign lang="greek">Διόνυσον εἰς θεοὺς ἀνελθεῖν καὶ τὴν Σεμέλην ἀνάγειν
            ὕστερον</foreign>. These examples are certainly more to the point. It is worthy of
            remark that Justin Martyr in a remarkable passage of his <title>Apologia pro
            Christianis</title> speaks of the ascent of Asclepius and others into Heaven as Pagan
            parallels to the Christian doctrine of the Ascension: <foreign lang="greek">Ἰησοῦν

            21: cf. also <title>Dialogus cum Tryphone</title> 69). I was once half inclined to
            suspect that the clause <foreign lang="greek">ὥσπερ ἐξ Αἵδου
            ἀνελθεῖν</foreign> (although it appears in all MSS) might be an early
            satirical adscript by some Pagan scribe on the doctrine of our Lord's descent into Hell,
            and subsequent resurrection and ascent into Heaven. <foreign lang="greek">τινες</foreign> might well be a specific allusion (518 B note), and there is more than
            a suspicion of satire in <foreign lang="greek">δή</foreign>. But I have no longer any
            doubt that the text is sound.</p>
          <p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ὀστράκου -- περιστροφή</lemma>. On the different
            interpretations given by the ancients of this proverb see App. VI. The proverb is
            derived from the game of <foreign lang="greek">ὀστρακίνδα</foreign>, the authorities
            for which are cited by Grasberger <title>Erziehung u. Unterricht</title> I pp.
            57&mdash;60. The players were divided into two parties, separated by a line. A

            boys, who shouted <foreign lang="greek">νὺξ ἡμέρα</foreign> or <foreign lang="greek">νὺξ ἢ ἡμέρα</foreign>, &lsquo;Heads or Tails,&rsquo; as he threw it.
            According as the white or black fell uppermost, one side ran away and the other gave
            chase. Plato means that education is not, like the &lsquo;spinning of a
            coin,&rsquo; an affair of no consequence, to be settled off-hand, and by chance, but
            a slow and laborious scientific process, dealing with the gravest of all possible

          <p>523A - 524C I distinguish (says Socrates) between two classes of perceptions, those
            which stimulate the intellect, and those which do not. To the former belong all such
            sense-presentations as are selfcontradictory. We have here, for example, three fingers.
            Sight tells us that each is a finger. So far there is no contradiction and the intellect
            is not roused. But it is otherwise with size and smallness, thickness and thinness, and
            the like. The perception which reports that suchand-such a thing is hard frequently
            tells us that it is also soft, and the same, mutatis mutandis, may be said of all
            perceptions which deal with relative qualities of this kind. In such cases the soul is
            perplexed, and appeals to the intellect for help. The intellect, promptly respond- <pb n="109"/> ing, apprehends &lsquo;great&rsquo; and &lsquo;small&rsquo;
            (for example) as distinct and separate from one another, unlike the senses, by which
            they were seen together and in confusion. It is thus that we are first led to ask

              <foreign lang="greek">αἴσθησις</foreign> by itself does not, and cannot, present us
            with a judgment of any kind. It merely furnishes a particular sensation, which is
            referred to our mental picture of the objects in question, and the resulting judgment is
            not <foreign lang="greek">αἴσθησις</foreign>, but <foreign lang="greek">δόξα</foreign>, which is, according to Plato, a combination of <foreign lang="greek">μνήμη</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">αἴσθησις</foreign> (see <bibl n="Plat. Phileb. 38B"><title>Phil.</title> 38 B</bibl> ff. with Bury's notes). And in
            point of fact, the sort of contradictory judgments which are here ascribed to the
            initial step in the psychological process, viz. <foreign lang="greek">αἴσθησις</foreign> (524 A), have already been attributed to <foreign lang="greek">δόξα</foreign> in V 479 B&mdash;479 E. We have already seen that Plato
            throughout the whole of this part of the <title>Republic</title> is not careful to
            distinguish between <foreign lang="greek">αἰσθητόν</foreign> (especially <foreign lang="greek">ὁρατόν</foreign>) and <foreign lang="greek">δοξαστόν</foreign> (VI 510
            A note); and the same tendency shews itself again here. But in this part of the
            dialogue, Plato's argument is no way affected by his imperfect analysis of the
            psychological process involved in such a judgment as &lsquo;This is a
            finger.&rsquo; The relevant consideration is that in such cases the intellect is
            not, as a rule, aroused, and this is equally true whether we regard the judgment as an
            act of <foreign lang="greek">αἴσθησις</foreign> alone or as the joint product of
              <foreign lang="greek">αἴσθησις</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">μνήμη</foreign>.

              154 C</bibl>. These passages should be carefully read in connexion with the view
            enunciated here. I have endeavoured to explain some of the wider bearings of Plato's
            principle in a pamphlet on Classical Education published by Deighton, Bell and Co. 1895:
            see also App. II and Nettleship <title>Hellen.</title> pp. 152 ff. We should bear in
            mind that the antithesis of <foreign lang="greek">ἕν</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">πολλά</foreign> was the <hi rend="italic">fons et origo</hi> of Greek
            philosophy, and runs throughout its entire history. In Plato's time the question had
            become acute in connexion particularly with the problem of predication, and it was in
            trying to solve this special form of the antinomy that Plato devised his theory of
            Ideas. Nothing could be more natural or just than that his philosopher-kings should
            receive their first scientific impulse from the problem which had proved so great an
            intellectual stimulus in the past, and which had also led Plato himself to the goal
            whither he would have his guardians arrive, the contemplation of the Idea.</p>

            remembered that touch does not always report that an object is both hard and soft, but
            only when it feels the object hard in relation to one thing and soft in relation to
            another, and similarly in other cases. This limitation is expressed by <foreign lang="greek">αἰσθανομένη</foreign> (as well as by <foreign lang="greek">&lt;&gt;ν τοῖς τοιούτοις</foreign>), and explains its emphatic position. I
            have sometimes thought that &lt;<foreign lang="greek">οὕτως</foreign>&gt;

            Thereupon the soul is puzzled (<foreign lang="greek">ἀπορεῖ</foreign>), and calls in
              <foreign lang="greek">νόησις</foreign>. If big-and-little appear (viz. to <foreign lang="greek">νόησις</foreign>) not one but two, then each of them appears distinct
            from the other, and one: cf. V 476 A and <bibl n="Plat. Parm. 143D"><title>Parm.</title>
              143 D</bibl>. &lsquo;Accordingly&mdash;if each appears one, and both together
              two&mdash;<foreign lang="greek">νόησις</foreign>, conceiving as it does of two

            Plato's object is to make out that <foreign lang="greek">νόησις</foreign>, in order to

            &lsquo;What is the great?&rsquo; &lsquo;What is the small?&rsquo; etc.;
            and just herein consists their periagogic or educative value, for to such questions the

            is better. It may have been this passage of the <title>Republic</title>, or <bibl n="Plat. Phaedo 96E"><title>Phaed.</title> 96 E</bibl> ff., or both which inspired the

In <foreign lang="greek">πᾶν παντί</foreign> Plato copies the formal language of mathematics:
            cf. <foreign lang="greek">ἑκατέραν ἑκατέρᾳ</foreign> and the like in Euclid <hi rend="italic">passim.</hi> For the sense see <bibl n="Plat. Phileb. 56C"><title>Phil.</title> 56 C</bibl> ff., where these two kinds of number are made the
            basis of a distinction between philosophical or scientific and popular or unscientific
              <foreign lang="greek">ἀριθμητική</foreign>. It should be carefully noted that a
            plurality of mathematical units is expressly recognised both here (<foreign lang="greek">ἴσον τε ἕκαστον πᾶν παντί κτλ.</foreign>) and in <title>Phil.</title> l. c.

            that Plato placed <foreign lang="greek">μαφηματικά</foreign> between <foreign lang="greek">αἰσθητά</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">εἴδη, τῷ τὰ μὲν

            In antiquity, while algebra was still unknown, <foreign lang="greek">ἀριθμητική</foreign> must have taxed the powers of thought far more than now, and
            been, from the Platonic point of view, all the more valuable on that account as an

            D. To say that in all such cases the comparative is equivalent to <foreign lang="greek">οὕτω</foreign> with the positive is only to shelve the difficulty; and it is better
            to recognise the usage as exceptional than summarily to dismiss it as a barbarism (with

          <p>526C - 527C Next in order comes Plane Geometry. On its practical uses we need not
            dilate; the important question is whether it tends to turn the soul towards Being. A
            mere tiro in Geometry knows that it is not a practical art, in spite of such terms as
            &lsquo;squaring&rsquo; etc., which the poverty of language compels it to employ.
            The object of geometrical knowledge is ever-existent Being. For this reason we shall
            prescribe the study of Geometry, a subject which is moreover practically useful and an
            excellent educational propaedeutic.</p>

            on 524 D, Rothlauf l.c. pp. 50&mdash;69, and App. II to this book. The great
            importance attached by Plato and his school to geometry and kindred studies is attested
            from many sources: see for example Philoponus <hi rend="italic">in Arist. de an.</hi> I

            φιλοσοφίας</foreign>. Among Plato's companions or pupils in the Academy, Eudoxus and
            Menaechmus rendered the most conspicuous services to mathematical science (see Allman
              <title>Greek Geometry from Thales to Euclid</title> pp. 129&mdash;179), and Euclid
            himself, according to Proclus (<hi rend="italic">in Euclid.</hi> p. 68), was <foreign lang="greek">τῇ προαιρέσει Πλατωνικὸς καὶ τῇ φιλοσοφία ταύτῃ
            οἰκεῖος</foreign>. That <foreign lang="greek">ὁ θεὸς ἀεὶ γεωμετρεῖ</foreign> was
            a characteristic and profound saying of Plato's (Plut. <title>Conv. Disp.</title> VIII
            2. 718 C ff.), on the meaning of which see App. I.</p>
          <p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">τὸ ἐχόμενον τούτου</lemma>. If <foreign lang="greek">γεωμετρία</foreign> i.e. <foreign lang="greek">ἡ τοῦ

            D) concerns itself with <foreign lang="greek">δευτέρα αὔξη</foreign>, and Stereometry
            with <foreign lang="greek">τρίτη αὔξη</foreign>, we may infer that <foreign lang="greek">ἀριθμητική</foreign> deals with the <foreign lang="greek">πρώτη
            αὔξη</foreign>, i.e. presumably the line, which, according to the Pythagoreans, is a
            collection of points (cf. <title>Laws</title> 894 A and Rothlauf l.c. p. 51). And in
            point of fact the line represented number among the Pythagoreans exactly as the point is
            the geometrical symbol for the unit: cf. IX 587 D note Hence <foreign lang="greek">ἐχόμενον τούτου</foreign>: we take the <foreign lang="greek">δευτέρα

          <p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ὅσον μὲν κτλ.</lemma> is exactly the attitude of
            the historical Socrates, as Krohn (<title>Pl. St.</title> p. 376) and others have
            pointed out, comparing <bibl n="Xen. Mem. 4.7.2">Xen. <title>Mem.</title> IV 7. 2</bibl>
            ff. Practical necessities of this kind probably originated the science (Gow <title>Gk
              Math.</title> pp. 134 ff.) and gave it its name <foreign lang="greek">γεωμετρία</foreign>. The name <foreign lang="greek">μαθήματα</foreign> (or <foreign lang="greek">μαθηματικά</foreign>) in the special sense of Mathematics owes its
            origin, no doubt, to the position occupied by mathematical studies in Plato's <foreign lang="greek">μαθήματα</foreign>: but the usage itself is not found till Aristotle
            (Rothlauf l.c. p. 18), although it is clear from [<title>Epin.</title>] 990 D, that some
            Platonists resented the <foreign lang="greek">γελοῖον ὄνομα γεωμετρίαν</foreign>.

            &lsquo;produce&rsquo; (as e.g. a line) has no authority, and Euclid's word for

            &lsquo;eternal and unchangeable&rsquo; (Arist. <title>Met.</title> A 6. 987^{b}
            16: cf. VI 510 C ff., VII 526 A note), but not Ideas. The Platonic meaning of <foreign lang="greek">τοῦ ἀεὶ ὄντος</foreign> is certainly not exhausted by the
            observation that &ldquo;the truths of every science are always true&rdquo;
            (Bosanquet). <foreign lang="greek">ὄντος</foreign> implies substantial existence,
            independently of our thoughts, and independently also of particulars. The existence of

            to rob the words of Plato of half their significance, in the fruitless attempt to find
            in his ontology nothing but what commends itself to certain schools of philosophy in the

              <foreign lang="greek">τινὸς</foreign> (if placed after <foreign lang="greek">ποτέ</foreign>) could hardly stand at all. Schneider translates &ldquo;des etwas

            wrongly explains <foreign lang="greek">τι</foreign> as &ldquo;aliqua

          <p>527C - 528E Shall we prescribe Astronomy as our third subject? Glauco approves,
            pointing to its usefulness in practical affairs. After reproving his friend for
            advocating the Platonic curriculum chiefly on this ground, Socrates observes that the
            solid should first be studied in itself, and afterwards the solid in motion. In other
            words Stereometry should precede Astronomy. Although the problems of Stereometry are not
            yet solved, we may hope for success under proper guidance, and with the support of the
            State.</p>

            l.c. pp. 194&mdash;202, Tannery <title>Rev. Phil.</title> X (1880) pp. 523 ff. The
            most famous stereometrical problem of Plato's time was the so-called &lsquo;Delian
            problem&rsquo; or duplication of the cube, and it is highly probable that Plato had
            this question in his mind when he wrote the present chapter. A dramatic poet, whom
            Valckenaer supposed to be Euripides, had already made allusion to it in the lines
              <foreign lang="greek">μικρόν γ’ ἔλεξας βασιλικοῦ σηκὸν τάφου·</foreign>
            &verbar; <foreign lang="greek">διπλάσιος ἔστω. τοῦ καλοῦ</foreign> (v.l.

              τάχει τάφου</foreign> (Nauck <title>Trag. Gr. Fr.</title> p. 676). The story runs
            that the Delians, having been commanded by an oracle to double a certain altar, were in
            great perplexity, <foreign lang="greek">διαπεμψαμένους δὲ τοὺς παρὰ τῷ Πλάτωνι
              ἐν Ἀκαδημίᾳ γεωμέτρας ἀξιοῦν αὑτοῖς εὑρεῖν τὸ ζητούμενον</foreign>
            (Eratosthenes, quoted by Eutocius in Archimed. III pp. 102 ff. Heiberg. See also Plut.

              <title>Das Delische Problem</title> p. 10). Plato favourably entertained their
            application, and the students of the Academy set to work with extraordinary enthusiasm.
            A remarkable stimulus was thereby given to the study of stereometry, and the Delian
            problem was successfully solved. The anecdote may of course be apocryphal, but we have
            not the smallest reason for rejecting it. The memory of such incidents is usually
            cherished with peculiar care in the history of a College, and Eratosthenes
            (276&mdash;194 B.C.) was born only seventy-one years after Plato's death. In any
            case the duplication of the cube may well have seemed in Plato's time a question of the
            first importance for the purposes of stereometrical science, for, as Tannery remarks
            (l.c. p. 256), the duplication of the square, which had already been discovered (<bibl n="Plat. Meno 82B"><title>Men.</title> 82 B</bibl> ff.), was believed to be the key to
            plane problems, and so it was probably surmised that the <foreign lang="greek">διπλασιασμὸς τοῦ κύβου</foreign> would give the solution of a whole series of
            solid problems. English readers will find a short account of this classical <foreign lang="greek">ἀπορία</foreign> with some of its ancient solutions in Rouse Ball's
              <title>Math. Recreations and Problems</title> pp. 154 ff. The most elaborate and

            Glauco's insistence on the practical uses of astronomy may be all very well with a

            (with Ast) as an independent question: for it is difficult to supply
            &lsquo;whether.&rsquo; Schneider's objections to this view are based on the idea

            Plato makes this clear by placing the two contrasting clauses in close juxtaposition.

          <p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ταῦτά γε -- ηὑρῆσθαι</lemma>. Plato does not of

            l.c. X p. 524), not to speak of Hippocrates of Chios, who had concerned himself in the
            fifth century B.C. with the question of the duplication of the cube (Allman <title>Gk
              Geometry</title> etc. pp. 84 ff.). He only means that its problems had not yet been

            of it to Plato himself is beset with grave difficulties, as Blass (l.c. pp.
            21&mdash;30) and others have pointed out (see especially Cantor l.c. pp.
            194&mdash;202 and Sturm <title>Das Delische Problem</title> pp. 49 ff.). It is
            however universally allowed that the principle involved &mdash;the finding of
            &ldquo;two mean proportionals between one straight line and another twice as
            long&rdquo; (Gow <title>Gk Math.</title> p. 169) &mdash;was first stated by

              <foreign lang="greek">οὔπω ηὑρῆσθαι</foreign> that Plato did not think a final
            solution of this as of other stereometrical problems had yet been reached: there is at

            to offer a solution of the famous difficulty (see Sturm l.c. pp. 22&mdash;32). In D.

            Plato implies that in his city this claim will be fully satisfied; and the Platonic

            Plato's picture of the <hi rend="italic">odium stereometricum</hi>, if the phrase may be
            allowed, is evidently drawn from life. He seems to speak as if he had himself an
              <foreign lang="greek">ἐπιστάτης</foreign> ready, and wished to secure for him public
            support in order that students might be willing to work under him. Now although <foreign lang="greek">ὡς νῦν ἔχει</foreign> belongs, strictly speaking, to the following
            clause, the words <hi rend="italic">may</hi>, so far as the Greek is concerned, be
            connected with <foreign lang="greek">ἔπειτα καὶ γενομένου</foreign>, and will then
            be equivalent to <foreign lang="greek">ὡς νῦν ἐγένετο ἐπιστάτης</foreign>. I think
            it not impossible that Plato intended his readers to suspect him <pb n="124"/> of this
            further meaning. If there is anything in this conjecture, to whom does Plato allude?
            Not, surely, to himself, although some have suspected the philosopher of blowing his own
            trumpet in a somewhat similar passage of the <title>Phaedo</title> (78 A): see
            Lutoslawski's <hi rend="italic">Plato's Logic</hi> pp. 263 f. We are told by Plutarch
              <hi rend="italic">de genio Socratis</hi> 7. 579 C that Plato referred the Delian
            deputation to Eudoxus, telling them that the problem was <foreign lang="greek">οὔ τοι
              φαῦλον οὐδ’ ἀμβλὺ διανοίας ὁρώσης, ἄκρως δὲ τὰς γραμμὰς ἠσκημένης
              ἔργον εἶναι· τοῦτο μὲν οὖν Εὔδοξον αὐτοῖς τὸν Κνίδιον ἢ τὸν
              Κυζικηνὸν Ἑλικῶνα συντελέσειν κτλ.</foreign> Now we know that Eudoxus not only
            himself achieved a solution of the Delian problem (Sturm l.c. pp. 32&mdash;37), but
            was also, in the fullest sense of the term, &lsquo;the founder of scientific
            Stereometry&rsquo; (G&uuml;nther in M&uuml;ller's <title>Handbuch</title> V
            1, p. 30), and did more for the subject than any of Plato's disciples (Cantor l.c. pp.
            208&mdash;210). For these reasons I think it not unlikely that Plato has Eudoxus in
            his mind. Eudoxus and his pupils seem to have been living and working in the Academy
            along with the followers of Plato sometime between Plato's second and third visits to
            Sicily (368 B.C. and 361 B.C.: see Allman <title>Gk Geometry</title> etc. p. 178), and
            it is a pleasing and I hope pardonable conjecture&mdash;I do not claim that it is
            more&mdash;to suppose that Plato avails himself of this opportunity to pay a
            graceful compliment to his fellow-workers. See also on line 19 below and

            course no stress should be laid on the conjecture&mdash;that <foreign lang="greek">ὑπὸ χάριτος</foreign> conceals some complimentary allusion to a particular person.
            If so, Eudoxus may be intended (see above on 528 C). There is, it is true, a tradition
            that Plato and Eudoxus had not always been on the best of terms (Allman <title>Gk
            Geom.</title> pp. 128 f.), but during the visit of Eudoxus to Athens between 368 and 361
            B.C., they appear to have worked harmoniously and even cordially together (ib. pp. 133,
            178). See also 530 A note But we have no evidence to shew that Eudoxus bore the
            sobriquet of <foreign lang="greek">χάρις</foreign>, though his character and
            personality (see Arist. <title>Eth. Nic.</title> X 2. 1172^{b} 15 ff.), and even perhaps
            his name, deserved such a compliment. I think Plato means merely &lsquo;through
            elegance,&rsquo; i.e. through the inherent elegance of the subject: cf. <foreign lang="greek">τό γε ἐπίχαρι καὶ διαφερόντως ἔχει</foreign>. The use of <foreign lang="greek">ὑπό</foreign> is as in <foreign lang="greek">ὑπὸ δέους φωνὴν
              ἔρρηξε</foreign> and the like: see K&uuml;hnerGerth <title>Gr. Gr.</title> II 1,
            p. 523. Badham's <foreign lang="greek">ἐπιχάριτα</foreign> for <foreign lang="greek">ὑπὸ χάριτος</foreign> is an unlucky venture. Dr Jackson suggests that <foreign lang="greek">ὑπὸ χάριτος</foreign> may perhaps mean &lsquo;by grace,
            favour,&rsquo; &lsquo;on sufferance&rsquo;: but Glauco's reply appears to me
            against this view.</p>

          <p>528E - 530C Astronomy will accordingly be fourth in order, and Stereometry third. Yes,
            says Glauco; for assuredly Astronomy compels the soul to look &lsquo;on
            high.&rsquo; On the contrary, Socrates replies, as studied at present, Astronomy
            turns the soul's eye down, though the bodily eye looks upward. True astronomy is not
            observation of the visible heavens, which are, like all things seen, imperfect and
            subject to change; it is a mathematical science, which studies the true movements of
            intelligible stars and uses the visible firmament as its orrery. We shall therefore
            pursue Astronomy by making use of problems and leave the heavens alone.</p>
          <p>ff. We have seen that the study of Stereometry, the science which deals with <foreign lang="greek">τρίτη αὔξη</foreign>, naturally follows the study of Geometry, in
            which <foreign lang="greek">δευτέρα αὔξη</foreign> is investigated (526 C note).
            Astronomy, like Stereometry, is still concerned with bodies of three dimensions, but in
            Astronomy we have one additional element, viz. Motion, so that the study of Astronomy,
            as Plato conceives it, is a degree more complicated than Stereometry, and forms its
            natural sequel: cf. 528 A, B. Plato's conception of <foreign lang="greek">ἀριθμητική</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">γεωμετρική</foreign> would have
            commended itself in the main to the mathematicians of his day (cf. 525 D ff., 527 A),
            although they might not have accepted his view of the ontology of these sciences; but in
            the two remaining subjects of his curriculum, Astronomy and Harmonics, he consciously
            and deliberately parts company with his contemporaries (see 529 A&mdash;530 C, 530
            E&mdash;531 C). After every allowance has been made for the perfervid enthusiasm of
            Plato's style, it must be confessed that the application of the principles laid down in
            this chapter would have checked the progress of astronomical science. Both Astronomy and
            Harmonics are treated by Plato as branches of pure rather than applied mathematics; and
            in each of these sciences Plato either discredits or altogether prohibits observation.
            It must be remembered, on the other hand, that Plato's object is not to promote the
            study of physical science for its own sake, but to provide a suitable <foreign lang="greek">προπαιδεία</foreign> for those who are to crown their lives by the
            contemplation of the Idea, from which every element of sense-perception is far removed.
            The astronomy which Plato sketches in this chapter is a unique compound of poetry,
            metaphysics and mathematics. Besides the powerful appeal which it makes to the poetical
            imagination, it has a permanent value even in the <pb n="126"/> history of Astronomy as
            a passionate protest against mere empiricism, and an emphatic if exaggerated vindication
            of the theoretical side of the science. See also on 529 C, D and App. II.</p>

            to Glauco the material heavens, not the <foreign lang="greek">νοητὸς τόπος</foreign>:
            and he thinks the soul looks upwards if the bodily eye is turned aloft! The essence of
            Glauco's error consists in materializing the spiritual; and Plato here warns us against
            a danger which is responsible for countless errors, not only in Platonic criticism, but
            in every department of human thought and dogma. See also on 529 B, C.</p>

              <title>Clouds</title> 171&mdash;173 <foreign lang="greek">ζητοῦντος αὐτοῦ τῆς

            had some ground for his anger. I don't in the least care, he says in effect to
            Aristophanes, whether your Socrates looks up or down: so long as he studies <foreign lang="greek">αἰσθητά</foreign>, he is not <hi rend="italic">my</hi> Socrates, and I

              <foreign lang="greek">ἐξ ὑπτίας νεῖν ἐν γῇ</foreign> as an allusion to Socrates
            in the <foreign lang="greek">κρεμάθρα</foreign>: cf. <bibl n="Plat. Apol. 19C"><title>Ap.</title> 19 C</bibl>

              <foreign lang="greek">κρεμάθρα</foreign>, as presumably he did, since he was looking
            at the moon, then any one who had seen the <title>Clouds</title> would at once catch the
            allusion, especially after <foreign lang="greek">ἄνω κεχηνώς</foreign> and the other
            references just above. For <foreign lang="greek">νεῖν</foreign> of floating in the air,

          <p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ἢ ἐν θαλάττῃ</lemma> is thrown in by Plato with

            him on land, float him, if you like, in the sea; but though his body's eye looks upward,
            his soul looks down. On the text and other views of this passage see App. IX. <pb n="128"/></p>

            embellishments in the heavens, forasmuch as they are wrought in that which is seen with
            the bodily eye, we should indeed consider more beautiful and perfect than anything

            the movements wherewith essential speed and essential slowness, in true and genuine
            number and in all true forms, are moved in relation to each other and therewithal make
            that which is essentially in them to move: the true adornments, which are apprehended by
            reasoning and the mathematical intelligence, but not by sight.&rsquo; The clause
              <foreign lang="greek">κάλλιστα μὲν ἔχειν</foreign> is concessive, and
              <foreign lang="greek">ἐπείπερ ἐν ὁρατῷ πεποίκιλται</foreign> gives the reason
            why <foreign lang="greek">τὰ ἐν οὐρανῷ ποικίλματα πολὺ ἐνδεῖ τῶν
            ἀληθινῶν</foreign> (sc. <foreign lang="greek">ποικιλμάτων</foreign>), for the
              <foreign lang="greek">ἀληθινὰ ποικίλματα</foreign> are wrought, not <foreign lang="greek">ἐν ὁρατῷ</foreign>, but <foreign lang="greek">ἐν νοητῷ</foreign>,
            i.e. in the lower <foreign lang="greek">νοητόν</foreign>, with which and which alone
            the true astronomer as such is conversant. See App. I. The clause <foreign lang="greek">ἃς τὸ ὀ͂ν τάχοσφορὰς κτλ.</foreign> explains <foreign lang="greek">τῶν ἀληθινῶν</foreign> (<foreign lang="greek">ποικιλμάτων</foreign>), being
            equivalent, as Schneider points out, to <foreign lang="greek">τοῦτ’ ἔστι, τῶν
              φορῶν, ἂς κτλ.</foreign>, &lsquo;that is, the movements which&rsquo; etc.
            So much for the relation between the different members of the sentence. In order to
            grasp the meaning of Plato, we should read the sentence aloud, letting the full stress
            of the voice fall on the words <foreign lang="greek">ἀληθινῶν, ὄν, οὖσα,
              ἀληθινῷ, ἀληθέσι</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">-όντα</foreign> in <foreign lang="greek">τὰ ἐνόντα φέρει</foreign>. Each of these words is emphatic, and
            expresses that degree of Truth or Being which belongs to the mathematical realities of
            true astronomy, as opposed to the sensibles or <foreign lang="greek">αἰσθητά</foreign>
            which form the subject-matter of the astronomy which Plato has just condemned. Popular
            astronomy observes with the bodily eye the movements of visible and material planets,
            e.g. Mercury and Mars. These two planets <foreign lang="greek">φορὰς πρὸς ἄλληλα
              φέρει</foreign> in <foreign lang="greek">γιγνόμενος</foreign> or <foreign lang="greek">κινητὸς ἀριθμός</foreign>, i.e. in time (cf. <bibl n="Plat. Tim. 37C"><title>Tim.</title> 37 C</bibl> ff.), Mercury, as astronomers tell us, completing
            his orbit in about three, and Mars in about twenty-three, months. In the second place,
            these planets travel in <foreign lang="greek">γιγνόμενα</foreign> (not <foreign lang="greek">ἀληθῆ</foreign>) <foreign lang="greek">σχήματα</foreign>, i.e. in
            forms or orbits which belong to the world of <foreign lang="greek">γιγνόμενα</foreign>,
            and as they travel they carry with them the <foreign lang="greek">γιγνόμενα</foreign>
            which they contain, Mars for example his snow-caps and canals. The Platonic astronomer,
            on the other hand, looks with the eye of <foreign lang="greek">διάνοια</foreign> at the
              <foreign lang="greek">ἀληθινὰ ποικίλματα</foreign>, i.e. at the motions of true or
            mathematical stars. These mathematical stars <foreign lang="greek">φορὰς πρὸς ἄλληλα
              φέρεται ἐν τῷ ἀληθινῷ ἀριθμῷ</foreign>, i.e. in mathematical number, e.g. in
            3 and 23 (not three <hi rend="italic">months</hi>, etc.), and also <foreign lang="greek">ἐν ἀληθέσι σχήμασιν</foreign>, i.e. in mathematical orbits, viz. the perfect
            ellipses which are imperfectly reproduced in the orbits of the visible material planets.
            Furthermore, although here perhaps our imagination may refuse to follow Plato in his
            flight, just as the visible Mars in his journey carries with him the <foreign lang="greek">γιγνόμενα</foreign> which he contains, so Plato represents the true
            stars of mathematical astronomy as carrying round with them <foreign lang="greek">τὰ
              ἐνόντα</foreign>, i.e. the mathematical <hi rend="italic">realities</hi> which are
            in them. The mathematical counterpart of Mars, for example, will take with it in its
            revolution those perfect mathematical forms which are imperfectly reproduced in the
            canals and snow-caps of the visible Mars. Plato in short conceives of a mathematical
              <foreign lang="greek">οὐρανός</foreign> of which the visible heavens are but a
            blurred and imperfect expression in time and space, just as every visible and material
            triangle is only an approximation to a true or perfect, i.e. a mathematical, triangle.
            The following remark of Aristotle's is intended as an objection to Plato's theory, but,
            according to the doctrine of this part of the <title>Republic</title>, Plato would have
            accepted the criticism as containing a just and true account of the astronomy which he
            prescribes: <foreign lang="greek">ἔτι δὲ εἴ τις παρὰ τὰ εἴδη καὶ τὰ αἰσθητὰ
              τὰ μεταξὺ θήσεται, πολλὰς ἀπορίας ἕξει. δῆλον γὰρ ὡς ὁμοίως γραμμαί τε
              παρ’ αὐτὰς καὶ τὰς αἰσθητὰς ἔσονται καὶ ἕκαστον τῶν ἄλλων γενῶν. ὥστ’
              ἐπείπερ ἀστρολογία μία τούτων ἐστίν, ἔσται τις καὶ οὐρανὸς παρὰ τὸν
              αἰσθητὸν οὐρανὸν καὶ ἥλιός τε καὶ σελήνη καὶ τἄλλα ὁμοίως τὰ κατὰ
              τὸν οὐρανόν</foreign> (<title>Met.</title> B 2. 997^{b} 12 ff.). It remains to
            speak of two particular difficulties. What does Plato mean by <foreign lang="greek">ταῦτα τὰ ἐν τῷ οὐρανῷ ποικίλματα</foreign>, and by <foreign lang="greek">τὸ
              ὂν τάχος καὶ ἡ οὖσα βραδυτής</foreign>? The <foreign lang="greek">ποικίλματα</foreign> seem to be generally identified with the stars and nothing more.
            But inasmuch as astronomy deals with <foreign lang="greek">φορὰ βάθους</foreign>, and
            the ordinary astronomer, according to Plato, studies <foreign lang="greek">τὰς τῶν
              ἄστρων φοράς</foreign> (cf. 533 A) rather than <pb n="129"/>
            <foreign lang="greek">ἄστρα</foreign> themselves, it may be presumed that the <foreign lang="greek">ποικίλματα ἐν τῷ οὐρανῷ</foreign> in reality denote the stars
            regarded as moving bodies, i.e., strictly speaking, the movements of the heavenly bodies
            revolving in their orbits (cf. <bibl n="Plat. Tim. 39D"><title>Tim.</title> 39 D</bibl>
            and 40 C); and the presumption becomes a certainty when we reach the words <foreign lang="greek">τῶν ἀληθινῶν, ἃσφέρει</foreign>, for since the true
              <foreign lang="greek">ποικίλματα</foreign> which true astronomy studies are
            identified with the movements of true stars, we are bound in like manner to suppose that
            the <foreign lang="greek">γιγνόμενα ποικίλματα</foreign> which observational astronomy
            studies are the movements of <foreign lang="greek">γιγνόμενα ἄστρα</foreign>. Some
            may be disposed to think that <foreign lang="greek">τὰ ἐν οὐρανῷ
            ποικίλματα</foreign> refers to the intricate and complex patterns which the orbits of
            the celestial bodies weave upon the Heavens: cf. <bibl n="Plat. Tim. 39D"><title>Tim.</title> 39 D</bibl>
            <foreign lang="greek">τὰς τούτων πλάνας, πλήθει μὲν ἀμηχάνῳ χρωμένας,
              πεποικιλμένας δὲ θαυμαστῶς</foreign>. But in view of expressions like <bibl n="Aesch. PB 24">Aesch. <title>P. V.</title> 24</bibl>
            <foreign lang="greek">ἡ ποικιλείμων νύξ</foreign> and <bibl n="Eur. Hel. 1102">Eur.
                <title>Hel.</title> 1102</bibl>
            <foreign lang="greek">ἀστέρων ποικίλματα</foreign>, it is better to hold that Plato
            adopts the word which was usually applied to the &lsquo;spangles&rsquo; in the
            heavens, the &ldquo;patines of bright gold,&rdquo; with which &ldquo;the
            floor of heaven is thick inlaid&rdquo; (<title>Merchant of Venice</title> V 1), and
            uses it of the movements of the stars, especially as throughout this chapter he
            consistently represents the visible stars which popular astronomy investigates as
            nothing but visible or material <foreign lang="greek">φοραί</foreign>. I understand
              <foreign lang="greek">τὸ ὂν τάχος</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">ἡ οὖσα
              βραδυτής</foreign> as the mathematical counterparts of visible stars. This
            interpretation is, I think, the only one which gives a proper sense to <foreign lang="greek">φοράς τε πρὸς ἄλληλα φέρεται καὶ τὰ ἐνόντα φέρει</foreign>, and
            no other solution preserves in its full and unimpaired significance the necessary
            contrast between the astronomy of observation and Plato's form of the science. The place
            which in popular astronomy is occupied by a <foreign lang="greek">γιγνόμενον
            τάχος</foreign>, e.g. the planet Mercury, and a <foreign lang="greek">γιγνομένη
              βραδυτής</foreign>, e.g. the planet Mars, is in true astronomy filled by <foreign lang="greek">ὂν τάχος</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">οὖσα
            βραδυτής</foreign>. Plato's conception of a true science of Astronomy is a remarkable
            product of his peculiar half-poetical, half-philosophical imaginative faculty, and
            differs fundamentally from the theory and practice of the science both in antiquity and
            now. But it must in fairness be allowed that if a science of astronomy could be
            constructed on Platonic principles, admitting no element of sense-perception, and
            dealing exclusively with incorporeal mathematical abstractions, it would prove a better
            prelude to the study of the <foreign lang="greek">ἀχρώματός τε καὶ ἀσχημάτιστος
              καὶ ἀναφὴς οὐσία</foreign> (<bibl n="Plat. Phaedrus 247C"><title>Phaedr.</title>
              247 C</bibl>) than could ever be provided by the astronomy which depends on
            observation of the heavenly bodies. See further App. II, and for other views of this
            passage App. X.</p>

            occasioned the search for Neptune, would not have seemed to Plato anything very
            extraordinary. Unless he is greatly exaggerating here, and I do not deny that throughout

            Plato's views on law in the heavens must have undergone considerable modification before

            as it seems to me, unduly anxious throughout the whole of this episode to minimise and
            explain away Plato's depreciation of the senses and their objects, although by so doing
            they can make his theories harmonize more nearly with the views of certain modern
            philosophers, and possibly also with the truth. Krohn (<title>Pl. St.</title> pp.
            170&mdash;174) inclines to the opposite error, although, except perhaps on verbal
            grounds, Plato would not quarrel with his definition of Platonic astronomy as
            &ldquo;die Wissenschaft von den Bewegungen intelligiblen K&ouml;rper.&rdquo;
            Plato's Astronomy is in fact a kind of idealised Kinematics, with occasional

          <p>530C - 531C Next will come the science which is sister to Astronomy, viz. Harmonics.
            For particulars we will refer to the Pythagoreans, taking care, however, to maintain our
            leading principles intact. We may ignore the good people who try to determine a minimum
            interval and unit of measurement by the ear; but the Pythagoreans are also wrong, for it
            is the numerical ratios of audible consonances which they study. They ought to ascend to
            problems and examine which numbers are consonant, which not, and why. The science of
            Harmonics is useless for our purpose if otherwise pursued.</p>
          <p>ff. With the science of Harmonics we reach the end of Plato's <foreign lang="greek">προπαιδεία</foreign>. Plato's conception of Harmonics is in all respects analogous
            to his view of Astronomy. We have seen that the visible movements of the celestial
            bodies are only imperfect copies of those mathematical movements which true Astronomy
            seeks to apprehend. In like manner, the audible movements which produce audible
            consonances are imperfect reproductions of those mathematical movements from which
            result mathematical consonances, and it is these true consonances which the <foreign lang="greek">ἁρμονικός</foreign> should study. The methods of pure mathematics are
            to be employed in Harmonics as well as in Astronomy, and observation and experiment are
            forbidden. If we criticise Plato from the standpoint of acoustical science, we must
            allow that he falls into the same error as before, but the emphasis, however
            exaggerated, which he lays on the mathematical and theoretical element in Harmonics, is
            not without importance in the history of the science; and we must remember that the
            study of Harmonics is valuable to Plato only as a preparation for Dialectic. The
            poetical affinities of the Platonic science of Harmonics are worthy of remark, though
            this chapter refrains from any allusion to them. It is altogether in harmony with
            Plato's theory to hold that &lsquo;the solemn and divine harmonies of music, heard
            or learned,&rsquo; appeal to us so powerfully because they are one expression of
            those &lsquo;unheard harmonies&rsquo; which are also expressed in the sister
            souls of Nature and of Man (<bibl n="Plat. Tim. 35A"><title>Tim.</title> 35 A</bibl>
            ff.), and although there is much in Browning's Abt Vogler to which Plato would demur,
            the idea which inspires that noble poem has its philosophical basis in some such theory
            as Plato here suggests.</p>
          <p>&ldquo;But here is the finger of God, a flash of the will that can, Existent behind
            all laws, that made them and lo they are! And I know not, if, save in this, such gift be
            allowed to man, That out of three sounds he frame, not a fourth sound, but a star. <pb n="132"/> Consider it well: each tone of our scale in itself is nought; It is
            everywhere in the world&mdash;loud, soft, and all is said: Give it to me to use! I
            mix it with two in my thought; And there! ye have heard and seen: consider and bow the
            head!&rdquo;</p>
          <p>It is perhaps because he believed that the Soul of the Universe no less than that of
            Man is attuned to these eternal harmonies, as well as for other reasons, that Plato
            makes his <foreign lang="greek">προπαιδεία</foreign> culminate in Harmonics. See also
            App. II.</p>

              <foreign lang="greek">ἁρμονίη ἀφανὴς φανερῆς κρείσσων</foreign> (Heracl. <bibl n="Plat. Fr. 47B"><title>Fr.</title> 47 B</bibl>ywater). &lsquo;Heard harmonies

          <p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">νὴ τοὺς θεοὺς κτλ.</lemma> There were two rival
            schools of musical theory in Greece, viz. &ldquo;(1) the Pythagorean or
            mathematical, who identified each interval with a ratio, (2) the
            &lsquo;musical&rsquo; (<foreign lang="greek">μουσικοί</foreign>), who measured
            all intervals as multiples or fractions of the Tone&rdquo; (Monro in <title>Dict.
              Ant.</title> II p. 193). Cf. <title>Modes of Anc. Gk. Mus.</title> p. 124. Plato's
            criticism was intended to apply to the first school; but Glauco erroneously understands
            it of the second.</p>

              <foreign lang="greek">ὀνομάζοντες</foreign> shew that <foreign lang="greek">πυκνώματα</foreign> is a technical term. The word <foreign lang="greek">πύκνωμα</foreign> does not appear to occur elsewhere in this sense, but <foreign lang="greek">πυκνόν</foreign> was a favourite word with writers of the
            &lsquo;musical&rsquo; school, as may be seen from its constant employment by
            Aristoxenus. <foreign lang="greek">πυκνόν</foreign> is thus defined: <foreign lang="greek">τὸ ἐκ δύο διαστημάτων συνεστηκὸς ἃ συντεθέντα ἔλαττον διάστημα
              περιέξει τοῦ λειπομένου διαστήματος ἐν τῷ διὰ τεσσάρων</foreign> (Aristox.
              <title>Harm.</title> 24. 10 ff. Marquard) i.e. any combination of two intervals which
            are together less than the interval remaining in the Fourth when the <foreign lang="greek">πυκνόν</foreign> is subtracted from the Fourth, e.g. two quarter tone
            intervals, or even two semitone intervals (but not more): see Aristox. l.c. 50. 15 ff.
            The definition in Bacchius <title>Isag.</title> 20 von Jan <foreign lang="greek">τὸ ἐκ
              δύο διαστημάτων ἐλαχίστων συγκείμενον ἐν ἑκάστῳ γένει</foreign> is less
            exact, but not, so far as it goes, inconsistent with that of Aristoxenus. Plato's
              <foreign lang="greek">πυκνώματα</foreign> must be &ldquo;haec ipsa <foreign lang="greek">πυκνά</foreign> vel alia parva et tamen composita intervalla,&rdquo;
            so called &ldquo;propter sonorum in angusto spatio quasi confertorum
            frequentiam&rdquo; (Schneider). Cf. <foreign lang="greek">πυκνότης</foreign> in

            καταπύκνωσις</foreign> etc. in Theo 91 and often in Aristoxenus, and see generally
            Westphal and Rossbach <title>Gr. Harm.</title> etc. pp. 105 ff. It is possible that the
            musical application of these terms was originally a metaphor borrowed from the art of
            weaving: for &ldquo;vestes <hi rend="italic">spatha textae</hi>, ob densitatem, quam

            should study intelligible stars with the mathematical intelligence, using the visible

            so the true <foreign lang="greek">ἁρμονικός</foreign> must investigate intelligible,
            and not audible, consonances. In the words of a modern writer, he must &ldquo;look,
            not into the tone-world here, but into the world of harmony beyond.&rdquo; Plato
            holds that certain mathematical numbers are in themselves <foreign lang="greek">ξύμφωνοι</foreign>, and others not: see Theo 72&mdash;75, where examples of both
            varieties are given. The numbers or ratios of audible consonances are only particular
            and imperfect embodiments or expressions of these numbers: they may serve as <foreign lang="greek">παραδείγματα</foreign>, but nothing more. In the <title>Timaeus</title>
            Plato represents the World-soul as the grandest expression of certain <foreign lang="greek">ξύμφωνοι ἀριθμοί</foreign>, so that it is natural enough for him to
            crown his <foreign lang="greek">προπαιδεία</foreign> with the study of mathematical
              <foreign lang="greek">ξυμφωνία</foreign>, and say that it is &lsquo;useful in
            seeking out the beautiful and good.&rsquo; It must nevertheless be admitted that
            Plato's conception of Harmonics as well as of Astronomy is fundamentally different from
            that of modern science, in spite of the attempts which Bosanquet and others have made to
            prove their essential harmony. See on 530 C and App. II.</p>
          <p>531C - 533D The pursuit of these studies, if carried far enough to reveal their mutual
            relationship, will contribute to the end which we desire; but after all, they are only
            the prelude to Dialectic. We may compare Dialectic to the prisoner's progress from
            looking on real animals to beholding the sun, and these preparatory studies to his
            release and ascent from shadows and images within the cave to shadows of real objects in
            the world above. Socrates declines to give an account of the method and object of
            Dialectic; but insists that the Good must be seen, and that Dialectic alone can reveal
            it, for Dialectic is the only study which ascends on the ruins of its hypotheses to the
            Idea of Good, leading the soul on high, and using the &lsquo;Arts&rsquo; as
            handmaidens and helpers in the process of education.</p>

          <p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ἡ δέ γε κτλ.</lemma> Having described <foreign lang="greek">διαλεκτική</foreign> in terms of the cave-simile, Plato now proceeds to
            describe his <foreign lang="greek">προπαιδεία</foreign> in the same way: cf. 515 C, 516
            A notes Bosanquet finds a difficulty in <foreign lang="greek">ἡ
              λύσισἐπάνοδος</foreign>, and thinks it just conceivable that these words
            describe the training in music and gymnastic and not the <foreign lang="greek">προπαιδεία</foreign> (so also Susemihl <title>Gen. Entw.</title> II p. 201). But
            Plato's language is perfectly definite; and <foreign lang="greek">τῶν τεχνῶν ἂς
              διήλθομεν</foreign> (532 C) cannot mean anything beyond or except the five studies
            just described. Nor is this the only passage where the &lsquo;turning
            round&rsquo; of the prisoners while still in the cave and their gradual ascent are
            identified with the <foreign lang="greek">προπαιδεία</foreign>, or with part of it: see
            521 C. Plato means that the emancipation of the soul is a gradual process, and that we
            are not to expect our mathematical studies to deliver us from <foreign lang="greek">δόξα</foreign> all at once. <foreign lang="greek">ἡ λύσις
            εἴδωλα</foreign> suggests that their first effect will be to loosen our
            intellectual bonds, and turn us as it were from reflected to original <foreign lang="greek">δόξαι</foreign>&mdash;from <foreign lang="greek">εἰκασία</foreign>
            to <foreign lang="greek">πίστις</foreign> (VI 511 E, VII 517 A notes). The higher we

            stages of the <foreign lang="greek">προπαιδεία</foreign> (symbolized by <foreign lang="greek">ἐκεῖἀποσκιαζομένας</foreign>) we escape from <foreign lang="greek">δόξα</foreign> altogether. See App. I.</p>

            Iamblichus: see cr. n. and cf. Bywater in <title>J. Ph.</title> X p. 78.

              <foreign lang="greek">ἀδυναμία</foreign> (<foreign lang="greek">βλέπειν</foreign>)
            is to be supplied: cf. <bibl n="Plat. Apol. 36B"><title>Ap.</title> 36 B</bibl> (where

              Gr.</title> II p. 1072. For <foreign lang="greek">ἔτι</foreign> with a verbal noun

            clearly explained). Even without the aid of the <title>Sophist</title>, we might deduce
            the meaning from the antithetical clause <foreign lang="greek">ἀλλ’ οὐκ
              ἀποσκιαζομένας</foreign>, if we remember that the sun is a <foreign lang="greek">θεός</foreign> (VI 508 A). The adjective is regularly placed after the
            substantive when two coordinate qualifications have to be expressed (here <foreign lang="greek">ἐν τοῖς ὕδασιν</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">θεῖα</foreign>):

            far: nor is there anything rude in telling him frankly that he has reached his limit,
            and even if there were, Socrates does not spare Glauco's feelings (cf. 527 D, 529 A).
            That his audience would not be able to follow a description of the Good, has already
            been implied in VI 506 E ff. <foreign lang="greek">βουλοίμην ἄν, εἶπον, ἐμέ τε

            more confident of his own expository powers, though he is careful, as before, to avoid
              <pb n="139"/> the appearance of dogmatism and therefore introduces the expression
              <foreign lang="greek">ὅ γε δή μοι φαίνεται</foreign> etc. (cf. <foreign lang="greek">τοῦ γε δοκοῦντος ἐμοί</foreign> l.c.) and <foreign lang="greek">προθυμίας</foreign> (cf. <foreign lang="greek">προθυμούμενος δὲ κτλ.</foreign> VI
            506 D). Krohn (Pl. St. pp. 179 ff.) bitterly complains of Socrates for drawing back; and
            Whewell (Phil. of Discovery p. 436) observes &ldquo;We may venture to say that it
            does not appear that he had any answer ready.&rdquo; The dialectical method
            recommended by Plato in the Republic is doubtless, in its full significance, an
            unrealised ideal (cf. nn. on <foreign lang="greek">ἀρχὴν ἀνυπόθετον</foreign> VI 510
            B and <foreign lang="greek">τοῦ ἀνυποθέτου</foreign> 511 B), just as the ultimate
            object of Dialectic, the Idea of Good, will still recede as we approach it. The
            description which follows merely recapitulates the account already given in Book VI,
            with a few additional characteristics already familiar in the Socratic school: but the
            majority of the Platonic dialogues furnish practical illustrations of many essential
            features in Plato's dialectical method: so that it is possible to form a tolerably clear
            idea of the kind of answer which the Platonic Socrates might have made in reply to
            Glauco's invitation. See on the whole subject App. III.</p>

          <p>, B 7 <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">τόδε γοῦν κτλ.</lemma> Socrates proceeds to
            establish what he has just asserted, viz. that only dialectic can reveal the Good to
            those who are versed in the propaedeutic &lsquo;arts&rsquo; or sciences. In this
            at least (he says) every one will agree with us, viz. &lsquo;that it is some <hi rend="italic">other</hi>
            <foreign lang="greek">μέθοδος</foreign>&rsquo; (different from the five
            propaedeutic &lsquo;arts&rsquo;) &lsquo;which endeavours in every case to
            apprehend by scientific procedure concerning each several self&rsquo; (e.g. <foreign lang="greek">αὐτοῦ καλοῦ, αὐτοῦ δικαίου</foreign>, etc.) &lsquo;that which
            they severally <hi rend="italic">are</hi>&rsquo; (the <foreign lang="greek">οὐσία</foreign> of each) e.g. <foreign lang="greek">ὃ ἔστιν καλόν</foreign>,
            etc. Cf. 531 D <foreign lang="greek">οὐ γάρ που δοκοῦσί γε σοι οἱ ταῦτα</foreign>
            (the five propaedeutic &lsquo;arts&rsquo;) <foreign lang="greek">δεινοὶ
              διαλεκτικοὶ εἶναι</foreign>. Socrates continues: while all the other arts (except
              <foreign lang="greek">τὰ μαθηματικά</foreign>) address themselves <foreign lang="greek">πρὸς δόξας ἀνθρώπων</foreign>, etc., even the mathematical
            &lsquo;arts&rsquo; give no <foreign lang="greek">λόγος</foreign> of their
              <foreign lang="greek">ὑποθέσεις</foreign> (and so do not apprehend the <foreign lang="greek">ὃ ἔστιν</foreign> of their subject). Dialectic and Dialectic <hi rend="italic">alone</hi> does this (533 C), so that Dialectic is the <foreign lang="greek">ἄλλη τις μέθοδος</foreign> and <hi rend="italic">alone</hi> satisfies
            our needs. <foreign lang="greek">τόδε</foreign> is the object of <foreign lang="greek">λέγουσιν</foreign>, on which, and not on <foreign lang="greek">ἀμφισβητήσει,
            ὡς</foreign> depends. <foreign lang="greek">ἄλλη</foreign> means other than <foreign lang="greek">ὧν νῦν δὴ διήλθομεν. ἀλλά</foreign> is opposed to the negative
            notion contained in <foreign lang="greek">ἄλλη</foreign> (another <foreign lang="greek">μέθοδος</foreign>, <hi rend="italic">not</hi> that of the five
            &lsquo;arts,&rsquo; but etc.). Badham arbitrarily proposes to read <foreign lang="greek">ὅρῳ περιλαμβάνειν</foreign> for <foreign lang="greek">ὁδῷ περὶ
              παντὸς λαμβάνειν</foreign>. The expression <foreign lang="greek">περὶ
            παντός</foreign> &lsquo;about everything&rsquo; is of course different from
              <foreign lang="greek">αὐτοῦ ἑκάστου πέρι</foreign>, and <foreign lang="greek">μέθοδος ὁδῷ</foreign> is the kind of collocation in which Plato delights. For

            then,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;the method of dialectic alone proceeds by the
            destruction of hypotheses to the actual first principle, in order to make its results
            secure.&rsquo; Dialectic examines and cancels (<foreign lang="greek">ἀναιρεῖ</foreign>) one <foreign lang="greek">ὑπόθεσις</foreign> after another, till
            in the end it reaches the Idea of Good. Suppose for example that <foreign lang="greek">ὁσιότης</foreign> is the subject of discussion. Various <foreign lang="greek">ὑποθέσεις</foreign> are proposed, tested, and overthrown. Out of the ruins of the
            former <foreign lang="greek">ὑποθέσεις</foreign> we built a new and better one, which
            must in its turn be thoroughly tested, tried, and perhaps overthrown, before it can
            serve as a stepping-stone to one which is higher, truer and better: cf. 534 B, C. Now
            this process of testing, revising, discarding, is not, ideally speaking, complete until
            we examine the relations of our <foreign lang="greek">ὑπόθεσις</foreign> of <foreign lang="greek">ὁσιότης</foreign> with all <foreign lang="greek">νοητά</foreign>, and
            in such an examination we apply the same &lsquo;hypothetical method&rsquo;
            throughout the whole noetic sphere, testing and correcting all our <foreign lang="greek">ὑποθέσεις</foreign> by one another. In the final stage, which is of course only an
            ideal, all our <foreign lang="greek">ὑποθέσεις</foreign> become exact counterparts of
            the Ideas, and we have reached the <foreign lang="greek">ἀρχή</foreign> or Good.
            Thereafter the results of Dialectic are <foreign lang="greek">βέβαια</foreign>: see VI
            511 B. The earlier steps in this dialectical ascent may be illustrated from many, if not
            most, of the Platonic dialogues. For <foreign lang="greek">ἀναιροῦσα</foreign> cf.
            Arist. <title>Topic.</title>

          <p>533E - 534E In conclusion, after pointing out the proportions between the different
            intellectual states, Socrates declares that the essential feature of Dialectic is its
            power to grasp the reason or principle of all Being, separating the Idea of Good, for
            example, from everything else, defining it in words, and scrutinizing the definition by
            tests, from each and all of which it must emerge triumphantly. Glauco agrees that such a

              ταῦτά &lt;ἐστιν&gt; ἀναλογίαν κτλ.</foreign>: cf. VI 511 E. I cannot
            agree with Shorey when he says (<title>Idea of Good</title> etc. p. 235) that Plato
            &ldquo;avoids drawing out the proportion <foreign lang="greek">εἴδη</foreign>:
            objects of <foreign lang="greek">διάνοια</foreign>=<foreign lang="greek">σκευαστά</foreign> etc.: <foreign lang="greek">εἰκόνες</foreign>, because he is
            aware that the second member is a blank and the fourth is largely fantastic.&rdquo;
            Both of these assertions are in my opinion quite wrong, and if they were true, Plato
            would have refrained from drawing out the proportions between the faculties themselves
            for exactly the same reasons. See App. I. As it is, we should take Plato at his word. He
            may well decline to enter on the tedious and unprofitable task of expounding and
            illustrating in detail the proportions which may be conjectured to obtain between the
            different objects of our intellectual powers. It would for example lead to no useful
            result if we tried to establish a proportion between a particular <foreign lang="greek">ε&lt;&gt;δος</foreign>, one of the five <foreign lang="greek">μαθήματα</foreign>, a particular object of <foreign lang="greek">πίστις</foreign>,
            and a particular object of <foreign lang="greek">εἰκασία</foreign>. Such attempts

            certainly means tests or elenchi which are applied to the theory which the dialectician
            is himself maintaining. Plato means that the dialectician tests his view of good not by
            &lsquo;seeming&rsquo; i.e. by what &lsquo;seems&rsquo; (good, bad etc.)
            to the many, but by the Truth i.e. by that which &lsquo;is&rsquo; in the

            also any special application? Probably it has: otherwise the witticism seems
            unnecessarily far-fetched and frigid, even if we make every allowance for Plato's love
            of a mathematical jest (cf. <bibl n="Plat. Plt. 266B"><title>Pol.</title> 266 B</bibl>),
            as well as for the interest which the subject of irrationals seems to have excited among
            the mathematicians of his day (see <bibl n="Plat. Theaet. 147D"><title>Theaet.</title>
              147 D</bibl> ff. and Cantor l.c. pp. 182, 191, 203). Lucilius (II 20) has the line
            &ldquo;vix vivo homini ac monogrammo&rdquo; (&ldquo;a dead-alive sketch of
            an anatomy&rdquo; Tyrrell <title>Lat. Poetry</title> p. 175), and Cicero mocks at
            Epicurus' gods as &ldquo;monogrammos&rdquo; (<title>N. D.</title> II 59: cf. I

            solido&mdash; praeditum etc., and other passages in Usener <title>Epicurea</title>
            p. 234). Perhaps Plato means to suggest that his &ldquo;airy
            burgomasters,&rdquo; as Milton calls them, would in such a case be only as it were
            mere silhouettes (&ldquo;Schattenrisse&rdquo; Bertram <title>Bilderspr.

            note; but the fact is that <foreign lang="greek">δεῖν</foreign> is not altogether
            pleonastic in the present passage. Without <foreign lang="greek">δεῖν</foreign> we
            should translate &lsquo;that it <hi rend="italic">is</hi> those natures&rsquo;
            etc. and not &lsquo;that it must be those natures&rsquo; etc.; and there is a
            slight but appreciable difference between the two. Richards would expunge <foreign lang="greek">δεῖν</foreign> or read <foreign lang="greek">ἀεί</foreign>, but
              <foreign lang="greek">ἀεί</foreign> is quite unsuitable here. <foreign lang="greek">ἐκλεκτάς</foreign> (which I once proposed, taking the words as=&lsquo;ought to
            have been selected&rsquo;) is equally unsatisfactory, nor does <foreign lang="greek">θεῖναι</foreign>, which might be suggested in place of <foreign lang="greek">εἶναι</foreign>, carry conviction. The text is in my judgment sound.</p>

            There is considerable variety here in the inferior MSS, but the evidence of the

            with this explanation the Scholiast and Lexicographers agree. Some of the ancients

          <p>537D - 540C At this stage the best proficients will be advanced to higher honours, and
            tested by Dialectic. Great care must be taken in introducing them to this study; for
            where the character is immature and weak, dialectical debate too frequently engenders
            lawlessness, by overthrowing inherited beliefs. We shall therefore forbid such
            disputations to the young. After five years devoted solely to Dialectic, the next
            fifteen will be spent in acquiring experience of government and practical affairs. At
            the age of fifty those who have triumphantly passed through every trial, will
            thenceforward contemplate the Good, descending when their turn comes into the Cave to

            The anacoluthon will of course be scouted by many scholars; but although it is
            ungrammatical, no doubt, it is scarcely harsher than many anacolutha in Plato; see
            Schneider on IV 430 E and Engelhardt <title>Anac. Pl. Spec.</title> III p. 40, where
            numerous examples of the <hi rend="italic">nominativus pendens</hi> are given. Plato
            begins as if he were going to write <foreign lang="greek">δοκεῖ μοι</foreign> instead
            of <foreign lang="greek">μαντεύομαι</foreign>: compare <bibl n="Plat. Apol. 21C"><title>Ap.</title> 21 C</bibl>

            in any case it is safer to retain than to expunge such echoes of conversational style in

            Plato does not intend his Guardians to neglect the subject between 35 and 50, although
            practical duties occupy most of their time. Moreover at 50, Dialectic is resumed, and it
            is not till then that the Idea of Good is fully apprehended, so that the five years from

            parallel is not very close. Plato's <foreign lang="greek">καθαρμός</foreign> is
            sufficiently explained by the precepts which he himself lays down in VI 501 A: see also
              <bibl n="Plat. Plt. 293D"><title>Pol.</title> 293 D</bibl> and especially

            various <foreign lang="greek">καθαρμοί</foreign> applicable to commonwealths, and 752 B
            ff. Whether the <foreign lang="greek">καθαρμός</foreign> of the <title>Republic</title>
            is itself either possible or adequate is another matter: Grote pronounces it an <foreign lang="greek">εὐχή</foreign> (<title>Plato</title> III p. 218 note). An age which had
            witnessed the <foreign lang="greek">διοικισμός</foreign> of Mantinea (<bibl n="Xen. Hell. 5.2.7">Xen. <title>Hell.</title> V 2. 7</bibl>) might well have regarded
            it as feasible. &lsquo;Possible, but difficult&rsquo; is perhaps the safest
            verdict. The purgation, even if successfully applied, might not be sufficient to start
            the city well, but it would be a useful auxiliary to that &ldquo;express initiative
            force, exceptional and belonging to some peculiar crisis,&rdquo; which (according to
            Grote l. c.) would float the enterprise. Bosanquet raises the question how far the
              <foreign lang="greek">καθαρμός</foreign> is seriously meant. To me it appears to be
            neither more nor less serious than Plato's treatment of the general question as to the
            possibility of his ideal city: see on VI 502 C and Hirmer <title>Entstehung u. Komp. d.

            gymnastic when all their elders have been sent away? From what other State are the new
            teachers to be brought?&rdquo; Plato is perfectly consistent. The new teachers are

          <p>543A - 545C Socrates now returns to the point at which the digression occupying Books
            V&mdash;VII began. There are, as we observed, four leading varieties of States and
            individuals, in addition to the perfect polity and perfect man. In order of merit they
            are (1) Timarchy, or the Cretan and Laconian State, (2) Oligarchy, (3) Democracy, (4)
            Tyranny. All other kinds of commonwealths, such as dynasties etc., lie somewhere between
            these primary and conspicuous varieties. Furthermore, inasmuch as the specific character
            of States is determined by that of individuals, there will be five leading types of
            individual character, embodied respectively in (1) the aristocratic, (2) the
            timarchical, (3) the oligarchical, (4) the democratical, (5) the tyrannical man. The
            first of these we have already described; but we must review the others also, in order
            that, by contrasting the best and worst, we may apprehend the relation between undiluted
            justice and undiluted injustice in respect of the happiness and misery of their
            possessors. As before, we will examine the commonwealths first, and afterwards the
            individuals.</p>
          <p>ff. The description of the philosopher and the philosophic city is at last complete,
            and the argument returns to the point at which the &lsquo;digression&rsquo;
            began, viz. V 449 A: see note ad loc. Plato has already said repeatedly, and reminds us
            yet again in 544 A, that the aim of our whole investigation was to decide <foreign lang="greek">εἰ ὁ ἄριστος εὐδαιμονέστατος καὶ ὁ κάκιστος ἀθλιώτατος, ἢ
              ἄλλως ἔχοι</foreign> (cf. II 368 E, 369 A notes). With the character of the
            perfect man we are now familiar, but we have still to discover and describe <foreign lang="greek">τὸν κάκιστον</foreign>, in order that we may institute our comparison
            and pronounce our verdict. This is the task to which Plato addresses himself in VIII and
            IX (down to 576 B). The method which he follows resembles that adopted in II 369 B
            ff.&mdash;IV. In the first place, he retains throughout the former analogy between
            the Soul and the City, and his account of the imperfect man is in every instance
            preceded by an account of the imperfect State. Secondly, instead of going straight to
            the mark and giving us a single ready-made sketch of total and complete depravity, Plato
            draws an elaborate and quasi-historical picture of the gradual descent of the perfect
            State and the perfect Man through successive phases of ever-growing degeneration down to
            the lowest depth of wickedness and crime. In the same way, as Nettleship observes
              (<title>Lect. and Rem.</title> II p. 295), &ldquo;in describing a perfect state,
            or certain steps in the process of forming a perfect state,&rdquo; he sometimes
            wrote &ldquo;as if one step of that process succeeded another in a historical
            order.&rdquo; See on II 369 B, 372 D, 373 D et al. The question has often been
            discussed whether the sequence of polities in VIII and IX was intended to be really
            historical or not: see for example Zeller^{4} II pp. 923&mdash;925, Henkel
              <title>Studien zur Gesch. d. Gr. Lehre v. Staat</title> p. 56 and Krohn <title>Pl.
            St.</title> pp. 204 ff. Aristotle seems to have understood Plato's account as an attempt
            to describe the actual facts of Greek history, and severely criticizes it from his usual
            standpoint in <title>Pol.</title> E 12. 1316^{a} 1&mdash;^{b} 27 ; but Plato himself
            must of course have known as well as Aristotle that the historical development of Greek
            constitutions did not by any means always correspond with his scheme. See Whibley
              <title>Gk Olig.</title> pp. 62&mdash;88 and Greenidge <title>Gk Const.
            Hist.</title> pp. 12&mdash;35. The fact is that Aristotle altogether ignores the
            real object of Plato, which is, as we have seen, to arrive at the worst State and the
            worst man, and treats him as if he had undertaken to exhibit a full <pb n="196"/> and
            complete genealogical tree of all the changes good or bad which had ever taken place in
            Greek constitutional history. But Plato does not here profess to describe political
            advance, but only political decay; and even his theory of political decay is itself
            based upon a theory of psychological degeneration which justly and deliberately ignores,
            as irrelevant for our present purpose, the undoubted power of human character to improve
            as well as to deteriorate. The question, as Nettleship says, which Plato puts before
            himself is this: &ldquo;The human soul being as we have described it, and having in
            it a certain capacity for evil as well as for good, what would it come to, and through
            what stages would it pass, if its capacity for evil were realized gradually but without
            any abatement? In actual human experience there is always some abatement; there are
            always counteracting circumstances which prevent any one tendency working itself out in
            isolation and unhindered; but the philosopher may, as Plato here does, work out the
            result of a single tendency logically. These books therefore put before us an ideal
            history of evil, as the previous books put before us an ideal history of good&rdquo;
            (l. c. p. 295). The different stages in the decline of the individual soul are each
            reflected in the decline of the <foreign lang="greek">πολιτεία</foreign>, which is
            still, as in II&mdash;VII, not &lsquo;a lifeless instrument, or dead
            machine,&rsquo; but in the words of Isocrates, simply the soul of the State
              (<foreign lang="greek">ἔστι γὰρ ψυχὴ πόλεως οὐδὲν ἕτερον ἢ πολιτεία</foreign>
            <title>Areop.</title> 14). But although Plato treats the whole question from a
            psychological rather than a historical standpoint, it is none the less true that the
            materials of his picture are taken from Greek political and social life. In Books VIII
            and IX of the <title>Republic</title> we have an extraordinarily vivid and life-like
            embodiment of the results of Plato's observation and experience of the Greek character,
            both private and public, in all its different phases, Lacedaemonian, oligarchical,
            democratical or Athenian, and tyrannical; and the student of Greek history, whether
            political, economical or social, will obtain a clearer idea of the inner life and
            animating spirit of Greek constitutions from Plato's description than from any other
            ancient source whatever. For the rest, it should be noted that Plato has given us in
            this part of the <title>Republic</title> the earliest attempt at a Philosophy of
            History, and founded the psychological interpretation of the State. Every political
            movement is, according to him, the expression of some particular psychological impulse
            or impulses, and the Constitution inevitably assumes different forms, according as one
            or another element or &lsquo;part&rsquo; of soul obtains the mastery in the
            individual citizen. See on this subject Krohn <title>Pl. St.</title> pp. 199 ff., and
            Bluntschli <title>Theory of the State</title> pp. 76 f.</p>

            &lsquo;Kings,&rsquo; for Plato holds that there is no difference of principle
            between Kingship and Aristocracy: cf. VII 520 B with V 473 C, IX 587 B, and Henkel

            &lsquo;different&rsquo; gives a poor sense, and would take the genitive, which

          <p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ἐφεξῆς γιγνομένη</lemma>. From this and other
            indications it would appear on a first perusal that the sequence of commonwealths in
            VIII and IX is intended by Plato to be not merely logical, but historical also; but
            there is no question that the political evolution of Greek constitutions was far more
            complex than would appear from Plato's description. See on 543 A. We must above all
            things remember that it is in order to furnish a picture of the worst city and the worst
            man that the whole of this enquiry is undertaken, and Plato is at liberty to adopt
            whatever mode of presentation is best adapted for the object which he has in view. The
            form which he does in point of fact select is that of a historical narrative (see on 543
            A, 548 D), but the real order of the development which he describes is a
            &lsquo;logical order,&rsquo; and is primarily determined by psychological, and
            not by historical considerations. Although there are many points of contact between the
            development of Greek constitutional history and Plato's arrangement, Plato here employs
            narration primarily and chiefly as a vehicle or instrument for expressing the results of
            psychological analysis, and not because he believes that political development always
            and inevitably follows the same lines. See also on 543 A and infra 544 D.</p>

          <p>545C - 547C How does Timarchy arise out of Aristocracy? We may lay it down as a
            universal rule that constitutional change is originated by dissension within the
            governing class. Socrates invokes the Muses to tell &lsquo;how first sedition
            entered.&rsquo; Like everything else, our perfect city is subject to Nature's
            universal law, that whatever is created perishes. Out of the elements of the number
            which expresses the shortest period of gestation in the human kind, Socrates builds up a
            &lsquo;geometrical number,&rsquo; which he calls &lsquo;the lord of better
            and worse births.&rsquo; When, through ignorance of these, couples are united
            inopportunely, as one day they will be, a degenerate race of offspring arises. The best
            of these in due course become rulers; but the mixture of races&mdash;golden, silver,
            copper, iron&mdash;waxes greater, and sedition is the result. The contending parties
            finally, by means of a compromise, effect the transition to Timarchy&mdash;a form of
            commonwealth standing midway between Aristocracy and Oligarchy.</p>
          <p>ff. I have discussed the famous &lsquo;Number of Plato&rsquo; at length in
            Appendix I, and must refer the reader to that Appendix for a fuller justification of
            views which considerations of space preclude me from defending <hi rend="italic">totis
              viribus</hi> throughout the notes. The connexion of the episode with the argument of
            the <title>Republic</title> may be expressed as follows. In accordance with the form of
            a historical narrative which he employs throughout these two books, Plato invites us to
            conceive of his perfect city as having actually existed long ago, just as in the
              <title>Timaeus</title> (23 C ff.) and <title>Critias</title> (109 B ff.) the Platonic
            Utopia appears as prehistoric Athens. In making this demand upon the imagination of his
            countrymen, Plato could count upon the support to be derived from the prevalence of the
            view that mankind had degenerated from an age of innocence and bliss in the far-distant
            past: see the references in my <pb n="202"/> edition of the <title>Protagoras</title> p.
            xxiii and Rohde <title>Griech. Roman</title> pp. 216 ff. What, then, was the originating
            cause of degeneration? Plato finds the cause, not in anything peculiar to the Ideal
            city, but in a law which prevails throughout the whole of Nature&mdash;the law that
              <hi rend="italic">everything created is doomed to decay.</hi> There cannot be any
              <foreign lang="greek">ἴδιος μεταβολή</foreign> (to quote the phrase of Aristotle
              <title>Pol.</title> E 12. 1316^{a} 12) of a perfect City; for a city which carries <hi rend="italic">within itself</hi> the seeds of decay is not perfect, but imperfect. In
            the sequel Plato first describes the manner in which degeneration begins to take effect
              (<foreign lang="greek">οὐ μόνον δέον</foreign> 546 A, B), and afterwards
            proceeds to construct a Number which is the expression of that law of inevitable
            degeneration to which the Universe and all its parts are subject. The substance of what
            he has to say on the first head is that a psychologically inferior offspring gradually
            makes its appearance because children are sometimes begotten inopportunely. It is
            noteworthy that here, as everywhere in Books VIII and IX, the decline of the
            constitution or soul of the State (543 A note) is traced to the decline of the soul of
            the individual. In the words <foreign lang="greek">ἀνθρωπείῳ
            δὲτριάδος</foreign> (546 B, C), Plato, copying the method of the
            Pythagoreans, and closely following their calculations, at all events in the first part
            of the reckoning, attempts to give an arithmetical expression to the Law of Change in
            that which he calls the <foreign lang="greek">γεωμετρικὸς ἀριθμός</foreign>.
            According to the view which I have endeavoured to establish in Appendix I, the
            arithmetic, in which each of the factors and processes involved was full of significance
            to ancient speculators on the theory of numbers, may be thus expressed in modern
            arithmetical notation: (1) 3^{3} + 4^{3} + 5^{3}=216. (2) (3 x 4 x 5)^{4}=12,960,000
            =3600^{2}=4800 x 2700.</p>
          <p>The first number, 216, is the shortest period of gestation in the human race expressed
            in days. In the second equation, the number 12,960,000 expresses, also in days, the
            duration of a Great Year in the life of the Universe. Expressed in years, the number is
            36,000, if we count, as Plato here does, 360 days in the year. The two
            &lsquo;harmonies,&rsquo; 3600^{2} and 4800 x 2700, are the two cycles described
            in the <title>Politicus</title>, each of which is a Great Year. In the first <foreign lang="greek">ὁμοιότης</foreign> prevails, in the second <foreign lang="greek">ἀνομοιότης</foreign>: the World &lsquo;waxes&rsquo; in the first, and
            &lsquo;wanes&rsquo; in the second, without, however, suffering dissolution. In
            what sense the whole number 36,000 years, which astronomers sometimes called the
              <title>Platonicus annus</title> in the middle ages, is at once the numerical Cause of
            Change, and the &lsquo;lord of better and worse births,&rsquo; is pointed out in
            App. I, Pt ii &sect; 7, and also in the notes on 546 C. How far Plato attached a
            serious value to his Number and the calculations from which he derives it, I have
            briefly discussed at the end of App. I, Pt ii. Here it must suffice to say that the
            episode, like many other passages in Plato, is half-serious, and half-playful. The
            setting of the whole is mythical, for it is only for literary and artistic purposes that
            Plato pictures his ideal city as historically true: and the meaning of the latter part
            of the Number is deciphered by the aid of one of Plato's myths. Moreover, the style of
            the whole passage, though extraordinarily rhythmical and highly-wrought, acquires a
            touch of fantastic humour from the bewildering parade of mathematical terms, at some of
            which even Plato's own contemporaries would probably have smiled. On its serious side,
            the Number affords an interesting example of the application of Number and Mathematics
            to explain the life of the Universe and Man; and, as I have said in the Appendix, finds
            its fittest apology in the saying <foreign lang="greek">θεὸς ἀεὶ
            γεωμετρεῖ</foreign>. It is of some importance in the history of philosophy because of
            its connexion with Pythagorean embryology and physics, and its employment by the
            Neoplatonists to justify the wildest astrological vagaries. The extreme difficulty of
            the Greek has made the Platonic <pb n="203"/> Number a favourite hunting-ground of
            successive generations of scholars, and the works which have been written on the
            subject, a few of which are mentioned in the Appendix, are very numerous.</p>

            of the Universe. <foreign lang="greek">ἀφορίας</foreign> is said, because the rulers

              συζυγείς</foreign> is <foreign lang="greek">ὁμοιούντων τε καὶ ἀνομοιούντων καὶ
              αὐξόντων καὶ φθινόντων</foreign>, and as <foreign lang="greek">ὧν ἐπίτριτος
              πυθμήν</foreign> means &lsquo;of which 4, 3,&rsquo; Plato himself tells us
            two of the numbers, and the third is also readily suggested by <foreign lang="greek">πεμπάδι</foreign>. 3, 4 and 5 are said to &lsquo;make like,&rsquo; because,
            as we shall see, in the latter part of the Number, where the triangle fulfils its office
            as a <foreign lang="greek">κοσμικὸν τρίγωνον</foreign> (Proclus l.c. II p. 45. 23),
            they produce the &lsquo;harmony&rsquo; 3600^{2}, and square numbers are <foreign lang="greek">ὅμοιοι</foreign> (Iambl. l.c. p. 82): they &lsquo;make
            unlike&rsquo; because they produce <pb n="206"/> the &lsquo;harmony&rsquo;
            4800 x 2700, and oblong numbers are <foreign lang="greek">ἀνόμοιοι</foreign> (ib.):
            they are said to wax and wane in a figurative sense&mdash;to wax in the first
            harmony, which represents in a certain sense the waxing of the Universe, and to wane in
            the second, which represents its wane. As the elements out of which the Universe is
            formed, they may be said to grow with its growth, and decline with its decline. The
            words have also a further meaning as a description of 3, 4, 5 regarded as the <foreign lang="greek">ἀρχαί</foreign> of everything which exists: see App. I, Pt ii
            &sect; 5. Now the first number in which cubings of 3, 4 and 5 are present is 3^{3} +
            4^{3} + 5^{3}=216, and Aristides Quintilianus, in the passage where he refers to Plato's
            number, speaking of the Pythagorean triangle, remarks <foreign lang="greek">ἀλλ’ εἰ

            in 8, and 8 : 6 is &lsquo;the fourth&rsquo; (<foreign lang="greek">διὰ

            &lsquo;the fifth&rsquo; (<foreign lang="greek">διὰ πέντε</foreign>). In the
            next 12 days the body is formed: and 12 : 6 is the octave (<foreign lang="greek">διὰ

          <p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ὧν ἐπίτριτος πυθμὴν κτλ.</lemma> In <foreign lang="greek">ἀνθρωπείῳ δὲἀπέφηναν</foreign> the Pythagorean triangle
            was employed to construct the period of gestation for the microcosm or man: here it is
            used to construct two periods in the lifetime of the macrocosm or Universe, for that is
            what Plato means by the two &lsquo;harmonies.&rsquo; The translation is:
            &lsquo;of which, 4, 3 married with 5, yields two harmonies when thrice increased,
            the one equal an equal number of times, so many times 100, the other of equal length one
            way, but oblong:&mdash;on the one side, of 100 squares of rational diameters of five
            diminished by one each, or if of irrational diameters, by two: on the other of one
            hundred cubes of three.&rsquo; The antecedent of <foreign lang="greek">ὧν</foreign> is <foreign lang="greek">ὁμοιούντων τε καὶ ἀνομοιούντων καὶ
              αὐξόντων καὶ φθινόντων</foreign>, which I have already interpreted as the numbers
            3, 4, 5. Of these numbers (<foreign lang="greek">ὧν</foreign>) the <foreign lang="greek">ἐπίτριτος πυθμήν</foreign> i.e. 3, 4 (cf. Theo Smyrn. p. 80 ed.
            Hiller, Proclus l. c. II p. 37 <foreign lang="greek">ὁ ἐπίτριτος πυθμὴν γ́ καὶ
            δ́</foreign>), is &lsquo;married&rsquo; or &lsquo;coupled&rsquo; with 5.
            That is to say, 3, 4, and 5 are multiplied together: whence we get 3 x 4 x 5=60.
            &lsquo;Thrice increased&rsquo; is &lsquo;three times multiplied by
            itself&rsquo;; and 60 thrice increased is therefore 60 x 60 x 60 x 60. This sum,
            which is 12,960,000, yields two harmonies. One of the two harmonies is &lsquo;equal
            an equal number of times, viz. <hi rend="italic">so</hi> many times 100,&rsquo; in
            other words, it is a square (cf. <bibl n="Plat. Theaet. 147E"><title>Theaet.</title> 147
              E</bibl>) each of whose sides is a certain number of times 100 (for <foreign lang="greek">τοσαυτάκις</foreign> cf. <foreign lang="greek">τοσοῦτον</foreign> in
              <title>Alc.</title> I 108 E), viz. of course 36 times 100, for 60 x 60 x 60 x
            60=3600^{2}. See Fig. 4. <figure/> The other harmony which 60 x 60 x 60 x 60 yields is a
            rectangle (with <foreign lang="greek">προμήκη</foreign> cf. <pb n="207"/>
            <bibl n="Plat. Theaet. 148A"><title>Theaet.</title> 148 A</bibl>), one of whose sides is
            one hundred cubes of 3, i.e. 2700, and the other the number which Plato describes in
              <foreign lang="greek">ἑκατὸν μὲνδυοῖν</foreign>. What is that number?
              <foreign lang="greek">ἀριθμοὶ ἀπό</foreign> means (numerical) &lsquo;squares
            of&rsquo; (cf. Procl. l. c. II p. 38. 9 et al.): the side in question is therefore
            &lsquo;100 squares of&rsquo;&mdash;what? Of the rational diameter of 5 etc.
            Now the &lsquo;rational diameter of 5&rsquo; is the nearest rational number to
            the real diameter of a square whose side is 5 (Theo l. c. pp. 43 ff. and other
            authorities). The real diameter <figure/> of a square whose side is 5 is &radic;50.
            See Fig. 5. AC^{2}=5^{2} + 5^{2}=50 (by Pythagoras' famous <foreign lang="greek">εὕρημα</foreign> Eucl. I 47): therefore AC=&radic;50. And the nearest rational
            number to &radic;50 is 7: for &radic;49=7. Consequently 7 is &lsquo;the
            rational diameter&rsquo; of 5. And 100 squares of 7=100 x 49=4900. But we are told
            to diminish the 100 squares by 1 each. Do so: 4900 - (1 x 100)=4800. This side is
            therefore 4800. The words <foreign lang="greek">ἀρρήτων δὲ δυοῖν</foreign> give us
            an alternative way of reaching the number 4800. The construction is <foreign lang="greek">&lt;ἀπὸ&gt; ἀρρήτων δὲ &lt;διαμέτρων δεομένων&gt;
              δυοῖν &lt;ἑκάστων&gt;</foreign> = (or of 100) &lsquo;squares of <hi rend="italic">irrational</hi> diameters of 5, wanting 2 each.&rsquo; Now the <hi rend="italic">irrational</hi> diameter of 5 is &radic;50. Square this and it
            becomes 50. 100 squares of 50= 5000. Subtract 2 from each square and you have 5000 - (2
            x 100)=4800. The two sides of the oblong are therefore <figure/> 4800 and 2700
            (&lsquo;one hundred cubes of three&rsquo;). The area is 4800 x 2700= 12,960,000
            which is 60 x 60 x 60 x 60. See Fig. 6. Thus the arithmetical meaning of this part of
            Plato's Number may be expressed by us as follows:</p>
          <p>(3 x 4 x 5)^{4}=3600^{2}=4800 x 2700.</p>
          <p>In this explanation, which is defended at length in App. I, Pt i &sect; 2, the most
            important novelty is my view of <foreign lang="greek">τρὶς αὐξηθείς</foreign>. Most,
            but not quite all, of the other expressions have been explained in the above way at one
            time or another, though never, as far as I have noticed, by any single critic. The
            meaning of <foreign lang="greek">ἐπίτριτος πυθμήν</foreign> was perfectly well known
            to ancient mathematicians: and Proclus fully understood the
            &lsquo;rational&rsquo; and &lsquo;irrational&rsquo; diameters of 5. The
            full explanation of <foreign lang="greek">ἑκατὸν μὲντριάδος</foreign> is
            due to Barozzi, except that he did not multiply the sides. As regards <foreign lang="greek">τρὶς αὐξηθείς</foreign>, I believe that I have proved my view in App.
            I, Pt i &sect; 2 and Pt iii. Here I will only say that just as in the increasing
            series 1, 60, 3600, 216000 the number 216000 or 60^{3} is the &lsquo;<hi rend="italic">third</hi> increase&rsquo; (<foreign lang="greek">τρίτη
            αὔξη</foreign>) of unity, so in the increasing series 60, 3600, 216000, 12960000, the
            number 12960000 or (as <hi rend="italic">we</hi> express it, but as Plato, to whom
            &lsquo;power&rsquo; means either &lsquo;square&rsquo; or
            &lsquo;root,&rsquo; never did or could express it, 60^{4}) is the third increase
            of 60.</p>
          <p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">συζυγείς</lemma>. The metaphor is from marriage, and
            marriage, among the Pythagoreans, was usually expressed by multiplication. Thus 6, which
            is the product of the first male number 3 and the first female number 2, was called by
            them marriage. <foreign lang="greek">συζυγεῖσα</foreign> also means
            &lsquo;multiplied with&rsquo; in Proclus l. c. II p. 544 (App. I, Pt i
            &sect; 2).</p>
          <p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">δύο ἁρμονίας</lemma>. The square and oblong may be
            regarded as <foreign lang="greek">ἁρμονίαι</foreign> because in them, as in the number
            216 above, all things are <foreign lang="greek">προσήγορα καὶ ῥητὰ πρὸς
            ἄλληλα</foreign>. Thus 12,960,000=(35 + 1) x 360,000, so that, as 35 is a <foreign lang="greek">ἁρμονία</foreign>, 12,960,000 contains the portentous number of 360,000
              <foreign lang="greek">ἁρμονίαι</foreign>
            <hi rend="italic">plus</hi> (1 x 360,000=) 360,000, each <foreign lang="greek">ἁρμονία</foreign> thus having added to it, as before, the unit which is <foreign lang="greek">ἡ πάντων ἀρχή</foreign>. The analogy between the Microcosm and the
            Macrocosm is thus preserved : see on <foreign lang="greek">πἁνταῥητά</foreign> 546 B <pb n="208"/> above. So much for the
            arithmetical meaning of the term <foreign lang="greek">ἁρμονίας</foreign>. In App. I,
            Pt ii &sect; 5 I have given my reasons for connecting the two <foreign lang="greek">ἁρμονίαι</foreign> with the myth of the <title>Politicus.</title> In that myth we
            are told how two cycles of equal and vast duration invariably succeed one another in the
            life of the Universe, a progressive and a retrogressive cycle. These two cycles are two
            Great Years, in the first of which <foreign lang="greek">ὁμοιότης</foreign> prevails
            and the Universe is fresh and strong, while in the second, in which we are living now,
              <foreign lang="greek">ἀνομοιότης</foreign> begins to assert itself and the Universe
            flags and wanes. Cf. 547 A note Here the first <foreign lang="greek">ἁρμονία</foreign>, which is a square and therefore <foreign lang="greek">ὅμοιον</foreign>, represents the progressive cycle, the cycle of <foreign lang="greek">όμοιότης</foreign>, and the second <foreign lang="greek">ἁρμονία</foreign>, which is an oblong, and therefore <foreign lang="greek">ἀνόμοιον</foreign> (see above on 546 B line 12), stands for the retrogressive cycle,
            the cycle of <foreign lang="greek">ἀνομοιότης</foreign>. If this identification is, as
            I believe, correct, each <foreign lang="greek">ἁρμονία</foreign> represents a Great
            Year. The area or number of each harmony, according to Plato, is 12,960,000, and as
            Plato elsewhere says that the Great Year is measured <foreign lang="greek">τῷ τοῦ
              ταὐτοῦ καὶ ὁμοίως ἰόντος κύκλῳ</foreign> (<bibl n="Plat. Tim. 39D"><title>Tim.</title> 39 D</bibl>), i.e. by the diurnal revolutions of the heavens,
            we may take this number as denoting days. Converted into years, on the astronomical
            calculation of 360 days to the year, followed by Plato here and elsewhere, the number
            becomes 36,000 years, which was known in Ptolemaic astronomy as the <hi rend="italic">magnus Platonicus annus.</hi> For the evidence on all these points, see App. I, Pt ii
            &sect;&sect; 5, 6.</p>
          <p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ξύμπας δὲ οὗτος κτλ.</lemma> &lsquo;This
            whole number, a number <hi rend="italic">measuring the earth</hi>, is lord of better and
            worse births.&rsquo; On its arithmetical side, <foreign lang="greek">γεωμετρικός</foreign> means only that the number is reached by means of <foreign lang="greek">γεωμετρία</foreign> and expressed in geometrical figures: but I have no
            doubt that Plato meant the word to bear another and profounder meaning, suitable to the
            real import of the two harmonies whereof this is the number. The number is <foreign lang="greek">τῷ ὄντι γεωμετρικός</foreign>, for it measures an aeon of the
            Universe, of which the Earth is part (cf. 555 A note and VI 511 B note): and indeed it
            is artistically right that the meaning of the two harmonies should be summed up at the
            climax of the whole in a single pregnant word. How do good and bad births depend upon
            this number? Because in the early days of our era, when God had but lately left the
            world, and <foreign lang="greek">ἀνομοιότης</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">ἀνωμαλία</foreign> were young, Nature produced better children than <foreign lang="greek">οἶοι νῦν βροτοί εἰσιν</foreign>. Plato in fact invites us to think
            of his city as having existed soon after the change to the aeon in which we now live,
            just as throughout Book VIII and part of IX the Ideal City is figured in the past. For
            more on this subject see App. I, Pt ii &sect;&sect; 5&mdash;7. I know not
            what others will think, but to me it seems that the extraordinary range and elevation of
            its central ideas make the Platonic number worthy even of a writer who is full of
            &lsquo;thoughts that wander through eternity.&rsquo; The connexion between the
            Human Child and the Divine, the Microcosm and the Macrocosm, has played no small part in
            the history of human thought, and the story of a Great Year, with the hope which it
            affords of the <foreign lang="greek">ἀποκατάστασις</foreign> of all things
              (<title>Acts</title> 3. 21), has been and is, in its religious setting, the solace and
            support of many a &lsquo;human child.&rsquo;</p>

            appointed certain periodic times or seasons in the life of men and women when their
            union will produce good offspring, but refers to unions of wrong couples, superabundance
            of marriages, and the like: cf. V 459 E ff. The notion that the number of the Great Year
            is to be <pb n="209"/> used by the rulers as a means of determining at what time unions
            should take place, derives no support from the Greek, and ought not to be entertained.
            In point of fact, the number is not a nuptial but a secular number, being <foreign lang="greek">γεωμετρικὸς ὡς ἀληθῶς</foreign>. The expression &lsquo;nuptial
            number&rsquo; is not applied to it either by Plato or by Aristotle, and it is only

            constantly associated by Plato with neglect of &lsquo;Music&rsquo;: see on IV

            well as the fact that in the city which comes next in order Gymnastic is more esteemed
            than Music (548 C). But <foreign lang="greek">πρῶτον</foreign> after <foreign lang="greek">ἡμῶν</foreign> supports the MS tradition, and the decline of the ideal
            city, which, as we have seen, arises from inevitable organic deterioration, shews itself
            in a general lowering of vital energy, rather than in the exaltation of any one pursuit
            at the expense of another. In the Spartan city Gymnastic ranks higher than Music,
            because Music has fallen from the high position which she formerly occupied, and not

          <p>547C - 548D So much for the origin of Timarchy. In character, it will resemble
            Aristocracy on the one hand, and Oligarchy on the other; partly also it will have
            peculiarities of its own. The aristocratical features of Timarchy are respect for the
            ruling class and so forth; its own distinctive peculiarity is the love of war and
            warlike matters; in cupidity and avarice it is like Oligarchy. On the whole Timarchy is
            a mixture of good and evil; but the one conspicuous feature of this polity is the love
            of victory and honour.</p>
          <p>Plato's description of &lsquo;timocracy&rsquo; is, as he says himself, a sketch
            (548 D), but one in which hardly any feature of first-rate importance is wholly ignored.
            He regards &lsquo;timocracy&rsquo; as primarily and essentially the political
            embodiment of <foreign lang="greek">θυμοειδές</foreign> (548 C), and consequently a
            sort of half-way house between aristocracy and oligarchy, as <foreign lang="greek">θυμοειδές</foreign> is between <foreign lang="greek">λογιστικόν</foreign> and
              <foreign lang="greek">φιλοχρήματον</foreign>. It is, however, at the same time a
            &lsquo;mixed&rsquo; constitution (548 C note), and partakes in the
            characteristics of both its neighbours. The portrait of timocracy is drawn in the main
            from Sparta, as the notes will shew, but it represents the Sparta of the fifth rather
            than of the fourth century, during which the oligarchical element in the Spartan
            constitution began to acquire an undue predominance, owing to the temptations of empire
            and other causes: cf. Isocr. <hi rend="italic">de Pace</hi> 95&mdash;103. Plato's

          <p>548D - 550C The character of the timarchical man is now described in close analogy with
            that of the timarchical State (548 D&mdash;549 B). In origin (continues Socrates) he
            was the son of a good father living in an ill-regulated city and abstaining from public
            life. Drawn by his father's precepts and example towards the higher life, and by
            maternal and other influences towards the lower, he finally surrendered himself to the
            dominion of the intermediate principle in the soul, and thus became timarchical.</p>

              <foreign lang="greek">είλκέτην, ἠγέτην, ὡμολόγησαν</foreign> 547 B, and indeed
            with the whole of Plato's exposition, which is deliberately arrayed in the vesture of a
            historical narrative or epic poem: see on 543 A, 544 C. It appears to be the custom to
            translate most of the aorists of this kind in Books VIII and IX by the present, but in
            some cases the effect is much more realistic and picturesque if we make them past, and I
            think that Plato intended some of these aorists to be understood in that way. The
            instances in point are 550 B <foreign lang="greek">ἦλθε, παρέδωκε,
            ἐγένετο</foreign>, 550 E <foreign lang="greek">ἀπειργάσαντο</foreign>, 551 B

              <foreign lang="greek">ἠλευθέρωσε, διένειμε</foreign>. Except in 550 E, 551 B, 555
            D, 565 B, and 566 E, in which the aorists are no doubt the so-called gnomic aorists
            &ldquo;used in animated language to express general truths&rdquo; (Goodwin
              <title>MT.</title> p. 53), each of these tenses is in my opinion correctly translated
            by a past in English. Plato of course repeatedly employs the <pb n="215"/> present also,
            not only where he is painting a scene (e.g. 549 B ff., 553 A ff., 555 C ff.), but also
            when he is describing the actual genesis of a particular sort of commonwealth or
            individual (e.g. 550 D, 551 A, B al. and many instances of <foreign lang="greek">γίγνεται</foreign>), and in such cases the appearance of historical narration is not
            preserved, for it would be pedantic to view all these presents as merely examples of the

            is here speaking of the origin of the &lsquo;timarchical&rsquo; <hi rend="italic">man</hi>, not of the &lsquo;timarchical&rsquo;
            <title>State</title>, and the <foreign lang="greek">ἀριστοκρατικός</foreign> whose son
            becomes <foreign lang="greek">τιμοκρατικός</foreign> may be found in any one of the
            degenerate commonwealths, although he will not rule except &lsquo;in his <hi rend="italic">own</hi> city,&rsquo; i.e. aristocracy. We must beware of supposing
            that there is no remnant of good men in depraved States (cf. VI 492 E ff., 496 C ff., IX
            591 E ff.). If Plato had here preserved the fiction of a historical narrative and made
            the <foreign lang="greek">τιμοκρατικὸς νεανίας</foreign> the son of an <foreign lang="greek">ἀριστοκρατικός</foreign> in his own ideal city, he could only have
            attributed his fall to the same law of natural degeneration which subverted the <foreign lang="greek">καλλίπολις</foreign> (546 A ff.). As it is, the description is drawn
            from facts of daily experience and observation, and Plato, as is suggested by the Oxford
            editors, may well be thinking of some &lsquo;Laconizing youth of Athens,&rsquo;
            perhaps of some member of the Socratic circle. We have already seen that Plato
            frequently deserts the epic or narrative form of exposition which he has chosen to
            express his views: see above on 548 D. I formerly printed a comma after <foreign lang="greek">πως</foreign> and a full stop after <foreign lang="greek">ἔχειν</foreign>, but now revert to Stallbaum's punctuation, because (1) the contrast
            with <foreign lang="greek">καὶ ἔστι μέν γε κτλ.</foreign> seems to require a fuller
            pause after <foreign lang="greek">πως</foreign>, (2) <foreign lang="greek">ἐνίοτε

            which Plato wishes to emphasise, is most easily accounted for on the supposition that

            grammatically it can only, as with <foreign lang="greek">ἀκούῃ</foreign>, be the son.
            I formerly placed <foreign lang="greek">αἰσθάνηται</foreign> after <foreign lang="greek">ἀχθομένης τε</foreign>: Richards excises it altogether. Neither
            solution is perfectly satisfactory; and it is possible that the sentence by some
            accident or other was imperfectly revised by Plato. The grammatical structure of this
            chapter from <foreign lang="greek">ἐνίοτε πατρός</foreign> down to <foreign lang="greek">ἐπαινουμένους</foreign> (550 A) is considerably freer than is usual
            even with Plato, and there are other passages in Book VIII which seem to stand in need
            of revision: cf. 558 A note Nothing is easier than to &lsquo;emend&rsquo; them
            all in accordance with our grammatical rules, but such emendations involve so great a
            departure from the MSS that they lack every element of probability, and as it is
            possible that the fault is Plato's, it is safer for us to adhere to the MSS. Nearly all
            the greatest writers occasionally offend against the rules by which we seek to bind
            them. See the excellent remarks of Longinus on the subject of correctness <hi rend="italic">versus</hi> fire in composition (<foreign lang="greek">περὶ

            ominous activity in the Spartan State, although it had not yet attained the <pb n="219"/> sovereign place. Plato's description of Greek oligarchies, if we judge it by the

            was <foreign lang="greek">πλουτοκρατία</foreign> (<title>Mem.</title> IV 6. 12). The
            establishment of a property qualification for full citizenship was the central feature
            in the programme of the Athenian oligarchical party from 412 B.C. onwards: see (for 411)
            Thuc. VIII 65. 3, 97. 1 and (for 404) <bibl n="Xen. Hell. 2.3.48">Xen.

            It is therefore natural enough that Plato should define oligarchy as he does, especially
            as in his younger days, both personally and through his friends, he was himself
            connected with the Athenian oligarchical faction (Grote VIII p. 30). The term
            &lsquo;oligarchy&rsquo; retained its Platonic sense after Plato (cf. e.g. Arist.

            (Bosanquet). The remark applies with equal force to <foreign lang="greek">πρὸ τούτου
              φοβήσαντες</foreign> (cf. Thuc. VIII 66. 2), and it can scarcely be doubted that the
            familiar struggles of oligarchy against democracy in his own as well as other times
            supplied Plato with this detail of the picture. But the employment of force would be
            equally necessary in order to transform a timarchy into an oligarchy, owing to the
            opposition to be apprehended from the impoverished and relatively poorer sections of the
            timarchs, who would under an oligarchy be formally and for ever excluded from office.
            The conspiracy of Cinadon partly illustrates Plato's point; for it was supported by

            forgotten 545 C, D, where constitutional change was said to originate from <foreign lang="greek">στάσις</foreign> in the ruling class. But the struggle between those

              <hi rend="italic">de iure</hi> rulers as well as the rich. In Sparta it would be
            otherwise, because those who failed to pay their contributions to the <foreign lang="greek">ξυσσίτια</foreign> ceased <hi rend="italic">ipso facto</hi> to be
            rulers; only Plato's timarchy is not in this particular a copy of Sparta, but rather

            explanation is, I think, easier than that of Stallbaum, who prints <foreign lang="greek">ἄθρει γάρ· εἰ νεῶν κτλ.</foreign>, understand<pb n="222"/> ing (after <foreign lang="greek">ἐπιτρέποι</foreign>) <foreign lang="greek">τί λέγοις ἂν περὶ
              τούτου;</foreign> or the like, and <foreign lang="greek">λέγοιμι ἄν</foreign> to
            govern the accusative with infinitive. J. and C.'s solution is in principle the same as
            Stallbaum's. The text may be corrupt, but no convincing emendation has hitherto been
            offered. The different proposals are <foreign lang="greek">εἰκός</foreign> (Ast,
            Richards) and <foreign lang="greek">ἂν εἴη δέος</foreign> (Liebhold) for <foreign lang="greek">ἦ δ’ ὅς</foreign>: &lt;<foreign lang="greek">φαίην

              κτλ.</foreign> Richards&mdash;but it would surely be better to add the word after
              <foreign lang="greek">ναυτιλίαν</foreign>. I have sometimes fancied that Plato wrote
              <foreign lang="greek">πονηράν, ἦ δ’ ὅς, τὴν ναυτιλίαν αὐτοῖς
            ναυτίλλεσθαι</foreign>, taking the accusative as in apposition to the previous sentence
            (cf. in some respects <title>Hipp. Mai.</title> 291 E and infra 567 C); but, for a
            reason to be mentioned presently on 551 D, perhaps <foreign lang="greek">ναυτιλίαν
              &lt;ἀνάγκη&gt;</foreign> is right.</p>

            anything except a gloss or variant on <foreign lang="greek">ὁτουοῦν</foreign>: the
            corrections <foreign lang="greek">ἥστινος</foreign> or <foreign lang="greek">ἡστινοσοῦν</foreign> (Ast) are much less easy and probable. <foreign lang="greek">περὶ</foreign> governs <foreign lang="greek">ἀρχῆς</foreign>, on which <foreign lang="greek">ἄλλου ὁτουοῦν</foreign>, which is neuter, depends.

            vexatious, although the evidence turns out to be so. Some misfortune, such as happened
            for example at the battle of Arginusae (Xen. <title>Hell.</title> 16. 33 ff., 7. 4 ff.,
            with Grote VII pp. 411 ff.), arouses a great wave of popular feeling, in consequence of
            which the general is put upon his trial, and <foreign lang="greek">συκοφάνται</foreign>
            manage to secure his condemnation (cf. Xen. l.c. I 7. 11). Badham and Cobet
            ignominiously expel <foreign lang="greek">βλαπτόμενον</foreign>, apparently for no
            better reason than that <foreign lang="greek">ἐμπεσόντα</foreign> can be followed by
              <foreign lang="greek">ὑπό</foreign> of the agent (Cobet <title>N. L.</title> p. 752,
              <title>V. L.</title>^{2} p. 54). If the passage is taken as I take it, <foreign lang="greek">βλαπτόμενον</foreign> cannot be cancelled without grave inconvenience;
            and even if <foreign lang="greek">βλαπτόμενον ὑπὸ συκοφαντῶν</foreign> be construed

          <p>554A - 555B In character, the oligarchical man resembles the oligarchical State. He
            gratifies his &lsquo;necessary&rsquo; desires and no others. He is avaricious,
            niggardly, sordid, and the blind god of wealth is leader of the chorus of his soul. From
            time to time, as opportunity offers, the drone-like desires within him assert
            themselves, but for the most part he forcibly represses them through fear of
            consequences. Thus, although his soul is a prey to sedition, his better desires
            generally prevail over those which are worse. In public competitions he is usually

            analogous to that produced by so-called partitive apposition (IV 431 A note), of which
            idiom a somewhat similar extension occurs in V 465 C, where see note. Richards suspects

              <foreign lang="greek">καί</foreign> was unlikely to disappear, and Plato's rapidity
            of thought and style renders him particularly liable to grammatical and other
            irregularities in his more spirited and dramatic passages: cf. VI 488 C, D, VII 531 A,

            dramatic effect: cf. X 617 D. <foreign lang="greek">ἡμέτεροι</foreign> has a
            colloquial ring (&lsquo;they are ours&rsquo;). A kindred meaning, but without
            any colloquial touch, appears in <bibl n="Xen. Cyrop. 2.3.2">Xen. <title>Cyr.</title> II
              3. 2</bibl> (quoted by Schneider <title>Addit.</title> p. 65) <foreign lang="greek">ἢν μὲν ἡμεῖς νικῶμενδῆλον ὅτι οἵ τε πολέμιοι ἡμέτεροι καὶ

            which Schneider finally suggested, has the support of A, II and other MSS. Baiter's
              <foreign lang="greek">ἄνδρες ἡμέτεροι εἰσὶ παρ’ οὐδέν</foreign> has found

            is intrinsically better (cf. 562 D), and may be right, but the intrusion of <foreign lang="greek">γάρ</foreign> in the best MSS remains a difficulty, and <foreign lang="greek">παραγγέλλειν</foreign> (as in Baiter's reading) is shorn perhaps of its

              (<foreign lang="greek">μεταδῶσι</foreign> but <foreign lang="greek">γίγνωνται</foreign>), no less than the meaning, clearly indicates that the two clauses
            do not express two separate and distinct acts. It is by means of the lot that <foreign lang="greek">ἰσότης</foreign> is secured; and hence democracy is not established
            until offices are assigned thereby: cf. Hdt. III 80 <foreign lang="greek">πάλῳ μὲν

              Const. Hist.</title> pp. 139 ff. The clause was, strangely enough, condemned by
            Hermann. Plato was not likely to omit all mention of the most characteristic and
            necessary factor in the establishment of a democracy, especially as he <pb n="234"/>
            introduces the same feature in describing the democratical man (561 B <foreign lang="greek">ὥσπερ λαχούσῃ</foreign>). J. and C., with Schneider and others, read
              <foreign lang="greek">γίγνονται</foreign>, for which there is very little MS support,
            remarking that &lsquo;the subjunctive is inexact, because any words dependent on
              <foreign lang="greek">ὅταν</foreign> should describe a characteristic of the origin
            of democracy, not merely a characteristic of democracy.&rsquo; The fact is that the
            words do explain the origin of democracy by explaining <foreign lang="greek">ἐξ ἴσου
              μεταδῶσι κτλ.</foreign>, where the aorist is rightly used of the act by which
            democracy is established; whereas if we read <foreign lang="greek">γίγνονται</foreign>
            the clause must be taken by itself, and then it can only express a characteristic of
            democracy after that constitution is in force, so that its proper place would be in the
            next chapter. It should be observed that in no ancient democracy that we know of was the
            lot employed in electing to <hi rend="italic">all</hi> magistracies: see Gilbert l.c. II
            p. 318. For this reason Plato writes <foreign lang="greek">ὡς τὸ πολύ</foreign>.</p>
          <p>557A - 558C The peculiar characteristics of Democracy are liberty and licence. It is of
            all governments the most manifold and many-coloured, resembling a bazaar of
            constitutions rather than a single polity. In a democratic city the individual is free
            to adopt his own policy independently of the State. Little trouble is taken to execute
            judicial sentences. The people are indulgent to educational defects in their leaders and
            require nothing beyond a profession of loyalty to the masses. Truly a delightful
            constitution, full of anarchy and colour, distributing a species of equality to equal
            and unequal alike!</p>
          <p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">τίνα δὴ οὖν κτλ.</lemma> The psychological
            principle of Democracy, as well as of Oligarchy, is <foreign lang="greek">τὸ
              ἐπιθυμητικόν</foreign>. But whereas in Oligarchy everything was subjected to the
            dominion of one particular desire, viz. the desire of wealth (550 C note), Democracy, on
            the other hand, is the political embodiment of absolute freedom and equality among all
            desires, unnecessary as well as necessary: see on 558 C ff. The materials for Plato's
            picture of democracy are of course taken from Athens more than any other single city. It
            is an extraordinarily vivid sketch; and indeed Plato's whole account of democracy and
            the democratical man (557 A&mdash;565 C), in spite of manifest exaggerations, brings
            Athens nearer to us than almost any monument of ancient literature, Aristophanes alone
            excepted. We can see that Plato was fully alive to the wonderful variety and colour of
            Athenian life; but even on this ground democracy did not appear to him worthy of praise.
            Multiplicity and variety are the offspring of that fatal <foreign lang="greek">ἀνομοιότης</foreign> which works ruin alike in the city and the soul (547 A note).
            In other respects, Plato represents democracy as a land of Hedonism, peopled by Anarchy
            and Waywardness, and darkened by the shadow of the Tyranny to which it must at last
            succumb. Nearly all the greatest writers of Greek antiquity were on the whole
            unfavourable to democracy, except of course the Orators: and least of all in Plato could
            democracy expect a champion. For the other side of the picture, we should of course take
            Pericles' speech in Thuc. II 35 ff. See Neil's <title>Knights of Aristophanes</title>

              παμπολλαί, ἀλλ’ οὐ πόλις</foreign>, the different varieties of individuals living
            in it representing so many different constitutions. In view of 561 C we may even go

            as Plato would hold, the waywardness and instability of democratic policy, constantly
            reversing to-morrow what it decrees today. See Thuc. I 44, II 65, III 36 ff., IV 28 and
            VIII 1. Democracy in fact, from Plato's point of view, is the political expression of

            an invisible <foreign lang="greek">ἥρως</foreign> or circumambient spirit of one who
            has joined the happy or unhappy dead: see Rohde <title>Psyche</title>^{2} I pp. 146 ff.

              (<title>Rev. d. Phil.</title> VIII pp. 171 ff.) seems to think there is a specific
            reference to such an invisible hero as sometimes rendered service in battle (cf. Paus.
            III 19. 12 with Frazer's note, and Hdt. VIII 64); but Plato's language is quite general.
            The meaning cannot be &lsquo;parades like a hero&rsquo; (as Jowett translates),
            for <foreign lang="greek">ἥρως</foreign> is not thus used in Greek, and a parading
            hero always excites popular attention. J. and C. think &lsquo;there is an implied
            allusion to the <foreign lang="greek">νόστοι</foreign>. &ldquo;He is welcomed
            wherever he goes like one of the heroes returning from the siege of

              οὔτε ὁρῶντος οὐδενός</foreign>? It may be noted that the superstition of which
            Plato here avails himself was widely prevalent in Greece as elsewhere. Hence some of the
            Pythagoreans asserted <foreign lang="greek">ψυχὴν ε&lt;&gt;ναι τὰ ἐν τῷ
              ἀέρι ξύσματα</foreign> (Arist. <hi rend="italic">de An.</hi> I 2. 404^{a} 18), and

              ἡρώων φησὶν εἶναι τὰ πίπτοντα</foreign> (VIII 34). The famous passage in
              <title>Cor.</title> I 11. 10 looks like a relic of some similar idea. Cf. also <bibl n="Plat. Phaedo 81C"><title>Phaed.</title> 81 C</bibl>, Zeller^{5} I p. 452 notes,

            becomes almost identical with that of Epicurus, who classified Desires as (1) natural
            and necessary, (2) natural and not-necessary, (3) neither natural nor necessary. For the

          <p>559D - 562A Let us now return and explain the genesis of the democratical man. An
            oligarchical father has a son, whom he brings up on narrow and parsimonious principles.
            The young man tastes the &lsquo;honey of drones,&rsquo; and sedition is
            engendered within his soul. A struggle ensues, and after perhaps a temporary check the
            unnecessary desires prevail; but with the help of fortune and advancing years a sort of
            equality of all desires is finally established; and the man becomes an impartial devotee
            of pleasure in all its forms&mdash;a beautiful and many-coloured creature,
            &lsquo;everything by starts and nothing long.&rsquo;</p>
          <p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">πάλιν τοίνυν κτλ.</lemma> Plato's description of
            the genesis of the democratical man is one of the most royal and magnificent pieces of
            writing in the whole range of literature, whether ancient or modern. Throughout most of
            this chapter, in the words of Longinus, the style <foreign lang="greek">πλουσιώτατα
              καθάπερ τι πέλαγος εἰς ἀναπεπταμένον κέχυταιμέγεθος</foreign>
              (<foreign lang="greek">περὶ ὕψους</foreign> 12. 2), and no better example will ever
            be discovered of that full tide of lofty thoughts and images and words&mdash;a tide
            &lsquo;too full for sound and foam&rsquo;&mdash;in which the author of the
            treatise <title>On the Sublime</title> places the essence of <foreign lang="greek">&lt;&gt;ψος</foreign>. We owe to Longinus what is by far the best
            appreciation of Plato's hierophantic vein: see especially cc. 33&mdash;36, where we
            can hear more than a mere echo of that sublimity which is itself, according to Longinus,
            the &lsquo;echo of high-mindedness&rsquo; (<foreign lang="greek">ὕψος
              μεγαλοφροσύνης ἀπήχημα</foreign> ib. 9. 2). For a very different estimate the
            student may be referred to Dionysius of Halicarnassus (<hi rend="italic">ad Cn. Pomp.
              Gem.</hi> 753&mdash;765 Reiske), whose pedantic criticisms make it tolerably plain
            that a study of the Attic orators does not qualify a man to sit in judgment upon Plato.
            The present episode is hardly less remarkable for psychological insight than for
            elevation of style, and the description of the democratic man as the chameleon of human
            society paints him for all time (561 C ff.). As a representation of actual fact, the
            picture is doubtless somewhat exaggerated, as usual; but it is extraordinarily vivid and
            powerful, and shews that the Platonic analogy between the individual and the State may
            prove in the hands of a master an admirable clue whereby to unravel the workings of the
            human soul in the individual as well as in the State.</p>

            Schneider defends the MSS by explaining <foreign lang="greek">μεταβολὴ

This explanation is much too difficult
            and obscure. Nor can <foreign lang="greek">ὀλιγαρχικῆς</foreign> by itself stand for
              <foreign lang="greek">ὀλιγαρχικῆς πολιτείας</foreign>, at all events in this
            connexion. The MS reading can only mean &lsquo;of the oligarchical change within
            himself into a democratical,&rsquo; an expression which bears no sense. I formerly
            wrote <foreign lang="greek">ὀλιγαρχικοῦ τοῦδημοκρατικόν</foreign>,
            comparing 559 E, 560 A; but it may fairly be objected that the &lsquo;oligarchical
              <hi rend="italic">element</hi>&rsquo; within the man does not change into a
            democratical: it is the <hi rend="italic">government</hi> that changes. For this reason
            I now prefer my old suggestion (<title>Cl. Rev.</title> IV p. 357), although the
            corruption of <foreign lang="greek">ὀλιγαρχικοῦ  δημοκρατικόν</foreign> is
            perhaps somewhat easier to explain. For the combination of genitives cf. V 449 A note An
            alternative solution would be to insert <foreign lang="greek">πολιτείας</foreign> after
              <foreign lang="greek">ἑαυτῷ</foreign>. This gives excellent sense, but it is
            difficult to assign a plausible reason for the loss of <foreign lang="greek">πολιτείας</foreign> in all our MSS. I am unable to resist the conclusion that the text
            is corrupt, otherwise I should not venture to make any alteration. If Plato did not
            write the passage as it is printed above, there can be little doubt that <foreign lang="greek">πολιτείας</foreign> has accidentally disappeared.</p>

            Stephanus), would be easier; but I think Plato means to suggest that the oligarchical
            element present in this <foreign lang="greek">νεανίας</foreign> is a universal feature
            of the human race. J. and C. think <foreign lang="greek">ἐκείνῳ</foreign> and
              <foreign lang="greek">ἑαυτῷ</foreign> may have changed places&mdash;a
            conjecture which is surely too bold. Schneider, taking <foreign lang="greek">ἑαυτῷ</foreign> as &lsquo;himself&rsquo; and not

          <p>562A - 563E It remains to describe tyranny and the tyrannical man. As oligarchy was
            overthrown by the insatiate pursuit of wealth, so democracy begins to change to tyranny,
            when evil cupbearers provide the wine of Freedom in excessive draughts. Anarchy under
            the name of Freedom infects every department of life&mdash;political, domestic,
            educational, and social: the very dogs and beasts of burden become tainted with the
            prevailing vice. In the final stage no regard whatever is paid to laws, whether written
            or unwritten.</p>

            victim to the excessive pursuit of its ideal, viz. Wealth, so also the extravagant

            A&mdash;565 D Plato puts before us the different stages in the fall of democracy:

            bear to see any one making himself even a <hi rend="italic">willing</hi> slave. In the
            sacred name of Freedom, Democracy, which is now on the verge of Tyranny, puts freedom
            down. The sentiment is perhaps a little exaggerated, but otherwise suitable enough; only
            we should rather have expected Plato to express this meaning by <foreign lang="greek">αὐτὸς α&lt;&gt;τῷ προσφέρῃ</foreign>. If there were any
            well-authenticated examples of the middle of <foreign lang="greek">προσφέρειν</foreign>
            used for the active, it would be better to construe <foreign lang="greek">προσφέρηται</foreign> as if it were <foreign lang="greek">προσφέρῃ</foreign>, and
            suppose that the slavery is applied to others: but the instances of <foreign lang="greek">προσφέρεσθαι</foreign>=<foreign lang="greek">προσφέρειν</foreign> in
            Stephanus-Hase s. v. are either dubious or from late authors. The syllable <foreign lang="greek">-ται</foreign> at the end of a line is sometimes abbreviated in uncial
            MSS (see Bond and Thompson <title>Public. of the Pal. Soc.</title> I Plate 106), and
            this fact lends additional plausibility to W. H. Thompson's conjecture, that we should
            write <foreign lang="greek">προσφέρῃ</foreign> for <foreign lang="greek">προσφέρηται</foreign>. I once proposed <foreign lang="greek">τισί</foreign>, and the
            proposal is approved by a critic in <title>Hermathena</title> XXIV p. 252. The citizens
            become so sensitive that the least degree of pressure applied to any section of them
            rouses them all. Meantime, as neither of these conjectures is quite convincing, I have

          <p>563E - 566D Such is the seed which developes into Tyranny, excessive freedom generating
            excessive servitude, in accordance with a common law. The drones wax more numerous and
            violent, and ruin the democracy in course of time as once they ruined oligarchy. A
            democratical State contains three classes of citizens (1) the drones, stinging as well
            as stingless, (2) the rich who serve as drones' provender, (3) the Demos, with whom the
            sovereignty lies. The most active members of the drone-fraternity become leaders of the
            Demos against the rich. By dint of extortion and calumny the propertied classes are at
            last compelled in self-defence to form an oligarchical party. Hence arise impeachments
            etc., and the people range themselves under a single Champion. As in the fable he who
            tasted human flesh became a wolf, so this Champion of the People, as soon as he spills
            the blood of fellow-citizens, is doomed to become a tyrant. Civil war begins; the

          <p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">οὐκ ἐξ ἄλλης κτλ.</lemma> In early times,
            according to Aristotle (<title>Pol.</title> E 5. 1305^{a} 7 ff.) democracies used to
            give rise to tyrannies. The tyranny of Dionysius I of Syracuse is a notorious
            illustration from later history (see Grote c. 81). But tyranny had other origins as
            well: it constantly appeared for example during the transition from Aristocracy to an
            oligarchical form of government (Whibley <title>Gk Olig.</title> pp. 72&mdash;83).
            Plato deliberately selects that particular origin which accords with his psychological
            standpoint. In the decline of an individual soul, &lsquo;lawless&rsquo; or
            unnatural (<foreign lang="greek">παράνομοι</foreign>) desires succeed the <foreign lang="greek">ἰσονομία</foreign> in which all desires are treated as equal. Hence
            tyranny, which is only the political expression of unnatural desire, succeeds democracy
            in the fall of a State. Granted that Plato thought Athens was still degenerating, he
            must certainly have expected her, unless the process of decay should be arrested, to end
            in a tyranny. See also on IX 576 B. With the position of <foreign lang="greek">οἶμαι</foreign> cf. 568 C and other examples in Braun <hi rend="italic">de hyperb.

          <p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">προεστός</lemma> refers not only to the <foreign lang="greek">εἷς προστάτης τοῦ δήμου</foreign> (565 C note), but to <foreign lang="greek">δημαγωγοί</foreign> in general and all who lead the people whether as

          <p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ἐκτὸς ὀλίγων</lemma>. The leaders in a democracy,
            says Plato, belong to the class of drones&mdash;with a few exceptions. Pericles, for
            example, was an illustrious exception (Thuc. II 65. 8, 9 and Xen. <title>Symp.</title>
            8. 39); and so, according even to Plato himself, was Aristides (<bibl n="Plat. Gorg. 526B"><title>Gorg.</title> 526 B</bibl>). Plato's general attitude
            towards Athenian demagogues has often been censured; but nearly all the greatest writers
            of antiquity, except the orators, pronounce the same verdict.</p>

            252. <foreign lang="greek">βλίττει</foreign> is retained by J. and C.; but there is no
            authority for the intransitive use of the verb, and <foreign lang="greek">βλίσειεν</foreign> in the very next sentence is active. Schneider reads <foreign lang="greek">βλύττει</foreign>, which would be a <foreign lang="greek">ἅπαξ
              εἰρημένον</foreign>. Ruhnken's <foreign lang="greek">βλίττεται</foreign> is
            unexceptionable in point of sense, and has found much favour. The author of this
            emendation claims (in his note on Tim. <title>Lex.</title> s.v. <foreign lang="greek">βλίττειν</foreign>) that it is confirmed &ldquo;cum Scholiastae, tum Codicis
            Parisini auctoritate.&rdquo; But the Paris MSS have all either <foreign lang="greek">βλίττει</foreign> or <foreign lang="greek">βλύττει</foreign>; and Bekker's

            <foreign lang="greek">ἀφαιρεῖται</foreign>) <foreign lang="greek">τὸ μέλι ἀπὸ τῶν

            was sometimes abbreviated in uncial MSS (see on 563 D), it is easier to suppose that the

The <foreign lang="greek">προστάτης τοῦ δήμου</foreign> in Athens was simply, &ldquo;the leading
            demagogue, who acted as guardian and representative of the demos, as the ordinary
              <foreign lang="greek">προστάτης</foreign> did of the metoecs&rdquo; (Whibley
              <title>Pol. Part. in Ath.</title> p. 51). He was not a magistrate, although his
            position was recognised and much sought after. Pericles was certainly <foreign lang="greek">προστάτης</foreign>, and, among his successors, apparently Cleon and
            others. For the authorities see Whibley l.c. and Gilbert <hi rend="italic">Beitr&auml;ge</hi> etc. pp. 78 ff. For <foreign lang="greek">ἕνα
            τινά</foreign> Cobet substitutes <foreign lang="greek">ἕνα γέ τινα</foreign>,
            without sufficient reason: cf. VI 494 D note To my mind the emphasis on <foreign lang="greek">ἕνα</foreign> is much stronger without <foreign lang="greek">γε</foreign>: and Plato clearly intends to emphasise that word, for it is by the rise
            of a <hi rend="italic">single</hi> champion that tyranny is caused.</p>

          <p>566D - 569C The tyrant begins his reign with popular measures, but as soon as his

            it is a sad necessity of his situation that he should purge the city of wealth and
            virtue. To provide against his growing unpopularity, he must increase his standing army
            by enlisting foreign mercenaries and the slaves of private citizens. These are his

            tyranny and its retinue: that is why we exclude them from our city. The higher they
            climb the hill of commonwealths, the more the honour paid to poets flags. As for the

              <foreign lang="greek">σοφούς</foreign>: but the article is necessary because <foreign lang="greek">τοὺς σοφούς</foreign> represents <foreign lang="greek">τῶν
            σοφῶν</foreign> of the quotation. As regards the verse itself, it was Sophocles (in his
              <foreign lang="greek">Αἴας ὁ Αοκρός</foreign>), and not Euripides, who was the
            author: see the references in Schneider, with Blaydes on <bibl n="Aristoph. Thes. 21">Ar.
                <title>Thesm.</title> 21</bibl>, <title>Frag.</title> 311 and Dindorf on <bibl n="Soph. Fr. 12">Soph. <title>Frag.</title> 12</bibl> = Nauck <title>Frag.</title>
            13. Plato's error is repeated in <bibl n="Plat. Theag. 125B"><title>Theag.</title> 125
            B</bibl>, and the Scholiast on Ar. <title>Thesm.</title> l.c. remarks that Aristophanes
            and Antisthenes made the same mistake, suggesting that either Aristophanes misled the
            others (so also Hirmer <title>Entst. u. Komp. d. pl. Pol.</title> p. 658 note 2), or
            that the two tragedians wrote the same line independently (so Schneider also thinks).
            The latter supposition is unlikely. Perhaps the reduplication of the cant Euripidean
              <foreign lang="greek">σοφός</foreign> is responsible for a kind of error which was
            easier in antiquity than it would be now. There is little to be said in favour of
            D&uuml;mmler's conjecture (<title>Akadem.</title> p. 16), that Antisthenes had
            quoted the line as from Euripides in an attack on Plato for associating with tyrants
            (Dionysius I and II), and that Plato, in his hurry to reply, forgets to rectify his
            assailant's error. Still less should we suppose that Plato's perverse exegesis is meant
            to caricature Antisthenes' way of expounding poetry.</p>

            body, foresees the future, and has access to a region of truth denied, with few

            appears also in Aristotle <title>Frag.</title> 12 <foreign lang="greek">ὅτανἐν τῷ ὑπνοῦν καθ’ ἑαυτὴν γένηται ἡ ψυχή, τότε τὴν

          <p>&ldquo;that serene and blessed mood In which the affections gently lead us on
            Until, the breath of this corporeal frame And even the motion of our human blood Almost

            things.&rdquo;</p>
          <p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ὀρέγεσθαί του</lemma>. Schneider and Stallbaum
            read <foreign lang="greek">ὀρέγεσθαι τοῦ αἰσθάνεσθαι</foreign> with II (see cr. n.)
            and a majority of MSS; but such an expression would be heavy and unpleasing. Jowett and
            Campbell think &ldquo;<foreign lang="greek">καὶ αἰσθάνεσθαι</foreign> should
            perhaps be struck out and the accent restored to <foreign lang="greek">του</foreign>,&rdquo; while Burnet omits <foreign lang="greek">καί</foreign>,
            reading <foreign lang="greek">ὀρέγεσθαί του αἰσθάνεσθαι</foreign>. The text, I
            believe, is sound, but cannot mean &lsquo;to aspire further (<foreign lang="greek">καὶ</foreign>) to perceive something which it knows not&rsquo; (J. and C.). We
            may translate &lsquo;to yearn after it knows not what and perceive what it knoweth
            not.&rsquo; Just as in evil dreams the baser part of soul reaches out after the
            object of its desires (571 C), so also the <foreign lang="greek">βέλτιστον</foreign>,
            in these happier visions of the night, has longings which are all its own. <foreign lang="greek">ὀρέγεσθαι</foreign> expresses the instinctive and unconscious turning
            of the soul towards the fountain of her being, and the waking counterpart of these
            visions of the night are just</p>
          <p>&ldquo;those shadowy recollections, Which, be they what they may, Are yet the
            fountain light of all our day, Are yet a master light of all our seeing.&rdquo;</p>
          <p>With the use of <foreign lang="greek">ὀρέγεσθαι</foreign> cf. <bibl n="Plat. Phaedo 65C"><title>Phaed.</title> 65 C</bibl>
            <foreign lang="greek">ὀρέγηται τοῦ ὄντος κτλ.</foreign>, a passage which throws
            light on Plato's meaning here in more ways than one. <pb n="322"/></p>
          <p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ἡσυχάσας</lemma>
            <foreign lang="greek">. ἡσυχάζω</foreign> is used transitively only in the aorist: cf.
            Solon ap. Arist. <title>Ath. Pol.</title> 5. 3. Schleiermacher (<title>Platons
            Staat</title> p. 601) thinks that Plato recognises here, and in <foreign lang="greek">ἐγείρας, ἑστιάσας, πραύνας, κινήσας</foreign> etc., a fourth principle or
            &lsquo;part&rsquo; of soul, that viz. which is able to excite or calm the
            others. Krohn on the other hand sees in this passage a sort of implicit recognition of
            the &lsquo;ego&rsquo; as a separate and distinct entity (<title>Pl. St.</title>
            p. 217). The latter view is nearer the truth (cf. V 462 C, D notes); but we ought not to
            press the words too much: cf. <foreign lang="greek">ἐπιεικεῖ τινι ἑαυτοῦ βίᾳ
              κατέχει ἄλλας κακὰς ἐπιθυμίας</foreign> VIII 554 C, and III 411 B note</p>
          <p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">εἴδη</lemma>. Other examples of this rare form of
            the dual in Plato are cited by Roeper <hi rend="italic">de dual. usu Plat.</hi> p. 12.</p>
          <p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">μάλιστα</lemma>: i.e. more than when he retires to

            take the word generally, as if divination by dreams were the best way of grasping truth.
            Plato would hardly say this, nor indeed would the average Greek. See especially <bibl n="Plat. Tim. 71D"><title>Tim.</title> 71 D</bibl> ff.</p>

          <p>572B - 573C The origin of the tyrannical man is as follows. A democratical father has a

          <p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">τυραννικὸς δὲ κτλ.</lemma> I formerly printed
              <foreign lang="greek">δή</foreign> for <foreign lang="greek">δέ</foreign> (with <hi rend="italic">q</hi> and Vermehren <title>Plat. Stud.</title> p. 112), but now prefer
            the reading of the best MSS. Plato is testing his account of the origin of the
            tyrannical man by obvious and admitted facts: cf. (with Schneider) IV 442 E ff. Lust,
            Drink, and Madness are confessedly tyrants; and we hold that a <foreign lang="greek">τυραννικὸς ἀνήρ</foreign> in the strictest sense of the term (for <foreign lang="greek">ἀκριβῶς</foreign> cf. I 341 C) is produced when a man falls under the
            dominion of all three. So that our theory accords with everyday experience. <foreign lang="greek">μελαγχολικός</foreign> is not of course &lsquo;passionate&rsquo;
            (Jowett), but &lsquo;insane&rsquo;: cf. <foreign lang="greek">ὅ γε μαινόμενος
              καὶ ὑποκεκινηκώς</foreign> above.</p>
          <p>573C - 576B In respect of his character and mode of life, the tyrannical man plunges
            into every form of dissipation, and is hounded on by ever fresh desires. His income and
            property soon disappear; and in order to satisfy his clamorous lusts, he plunders his
            father's estate, not hesitating if need be to lay violent hands on father and mother.
            Then follow sacrilege and theft, and every variety of crime; for he has now become in
            living fact that which once he rarely was in dreams. Such men, if few in number, may go
            abroad and join a tyrant's bodyguard or remain to swell the ranks of petty criminals at
            home; but if they are numerous, they make the worst of all their crew into a tyrant over
            their fatherland. Tyranny is the goal and consummation of such a man's desires.
            Throughout his whole existence, both before and after he attains the crown of his
            ambition, the tyrannical man is a stranger to freedom and friendship, faithless and
            superlatively unrighteous&mdash; in one word, he is the living embodiment of the
            monstrous lusts we found in dreams, and the longer he rules, the worse he grows.</p>
          <p>ff. Plato's <foreign lang="greek">τυραννικός</foreign> is a monster without a single
            redeeming feature of any kind, the incarnation of unnatural desire, &ldquo;bloody,
            Luxurious, avaricious, false, deceitful, Sudden,
            malicious&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;not in the legions Of horrid hell can come a
            devil more damned In evils&rdquo; (<title>Macbeth</title> Act IV Sc. 3). It must be
            admitted that Plato takes a terrible revenge on Dionysius: see on 577 A.</p>
          <p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">γίγνεται κτλ.</lemma> &lsquo;Such, apparently,
            is the origin also of the tyrannical man.&rsquo; The stress of the voice falls on
              <foreign lang="greek">τοιοῦτος</foreign> i.q. <foreign lang="greek">τυραννικός</foreign> (<foreign lang="greek">τυραννικὸς ἀνήρ</foreign> in Socrates'
            last sentence). <foreign lang="greek">καί</foreign> is <hi rend="italic">etiam</hi> :
            we have now described <hi rend="italic">his</hi> origin as well as that of the others.
            J. and C. propose <foreign lang="greek">ἁνήρ</foreign>, as if Plato meant <foreign lang="greek">γίγνεται οὕτω, καί &lt;&gt;στιν τοιοῦτος</foreign>. But the
              <hi rend="italic">character</hi> of the man has still to be described (<foreign lang="greek">ζῇ δὲ δὴ πῶς;</foreign>): hitherto we have been concerned only with
            his <hi rend="italic">genesis</hi> (<foreign lang="greek">γίγνεται μέν</foreign>).
            Schneider caught the meaning (&ldquo;so nun entsteht auch dieser Mann&rdquo;);
            but recent English translators are wrong. For <foreign lang="greek">μέν</foreign>
            Richards conjectures <foreign lang="greek">μὲν οὖν</foreign> (or <foreign lang="greek">οὐκοῦν γίγνεται μέν</foreign> as an alternative). The asyndeton helps
            of course to accentuate the antithesis between <foreign lang="greek">γίγνεται</foreign>

              <foreign lang="greek">τε</foreign> (<hi rend="italic">q</hi> and Stallbaum), or
            suggest <foreign lang="greek">ἔχοντά τε καὶ τρέφοντα</foreign> (Richards). Neither
            proposal is either necessary or probable. The words <foreign lang="greek">ὥσπερ
            πόλιν</foreign> have also caused difficulty; and Vind. E offers the ingenious
            emendation <foreign lang="greek">πώλον</foreign> (<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>). Should
              <foreign lang="greek">ὥσπερ πόλιν</foreign> be connected with <foreign lang="greek">τὸν ἔχοντά τε αὐτόν</foreign> or with <foreign lang="greek">ἄξει</foreign>?
            The latter view has hitherto, I believe, been held; but the introduction of the parallel
            is very awkward, and, in point of fact, neither <foreign lang="greek">Ἔρως</foreign>
            nor even the tyrant himself was said in Book VIII to lead the city into daring deeds
            (VIII 566 D ff., quoted by Stallbaum, is nothing to the point). On the other view
              <foreign lang="greek">ὥσπερ πόλιν</foreign> is natural and easy: if <foreign lang="greek">ὁ ἔρως</foreign> is a <foreign lang="greek">μόναρχος, ὁ ἔχων τὸν
              ἔρωτα</foreign> is the <foreign lang="greek">πόλις</foreign> where he rules. Cf.

The text is assuredly sound; and although Stallbaum is
            here at fault, Vermehren correctly explained the passage as long ago as 1870 (<title>Pl.

            we are about to enter on a new stage in the discussion: cf. VI 487 A, 506 D al.
            Aristotle blames Plato for not saying what is to follow tyranny (<title>Pol.</title> E
            12. 1316^{a} 25 ff.). In reply, Plato would, I think, first point out that he is not
            required to touch on this subject either by the main thesis of the
            <title>Republic</title> or by the special aim which he has in view throughout Books VIII
            and IX (see VIII 543 A note). He might afterwards observe that, since the best hope of
            founding the perfect city lies in imbuing an absolute ruler or one of his descendants
            with a love of genuine philosophy (VI 499 B&mdash;502 C), the deepest darkness
            perhaps contained a promise of the dawn. See especially the striking passage in
              <title>Laws</title> 709 E&mdash;712 A. Aristotle seems to have understood him to
            mean this (<foreign lang="greek">ἐπεὶ κατ’ ἐκεῖνον δεῖ εἰς τὴν πρώτην καὶ τὴν
              ἀρίστην· οὕτως γὰρ ἂν ἐγίνετο συνεχὲς καὶ κύκλος</foreign> l.c.), and
            criticises him accordingly from the facts of experience; but the succession of polities
            in the <title>Republic</title> is not intended to be in all respects, or even primarily
            and chiefly, historical (VIII 543 A note).</p>
          <p>576B - 577B What shall we say then about the happiness or unhappiness of the individual
            who is most depraved? As is the city, so will the individual be in point of happiness as
            well as virtue. And the city in which a tyrant rules is of all cities the worst and most
            unhappy. What of the tyrannical man? He that has lived with a tyrant, and is himself
            moreover capable of judging, will best decide. Let us pretend, says Socrates, that we
            ourselves possess these qualifications.</p>

            remains to compare him with <foreign lang="greek">ὁ ἄριστος</foreign> in respect of
            happiness and misery. The present chapter is introductory to the triad of arguments by
            means of which Plato proves that the victory rests with <foreign lang="greek">ὁ

            virtually tells us, on the evidence of his own eyes (577 A, B notes), but we should of
            course remember that in such cases we are apt to see what we wish to see, and Plato's

            quam ad exitum orationis Socraticae&rdquo; (Schneider. Cf. V 465 E note). Glauco
            admits most fully the claim that Plato has earned a right to speak with authority on

          <p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">προσποιησώμεθα κτλ.</lemma> Plato cannot appear <hi rend="italic">in propria persona</hi>, so that it is necessary for Socrates and Glauco
            to pretend that they also belong to the number of those &lsquo;who would be able to
            judge&rsquo; and have met with <foreign lang="greek">τύραννοι</foreign> and
              <foreign lang="greek">τυραννικοί</foreign>. The fiction is rendered necessary by the
            laws of dialogue as <foreign lang="greek">ἵνα ἐρωτῶμεν</foreign> frankly
            states. We must beware of supposing that it is <title>Plato</title> who
            &lsquo;pretends&rsquo;: Plato does not pretend, but <hi rend="italic">is</hi>
            <foreign lang="greek">δυνατὸς μὲν κρῖναι, ξυνῳκηκὼς δὲ ἐν τῷ αὐτῷ
            κτλ.</foreign> (577 A). Richards objects to <foreign lang="greek">ἄν</foreign> with
              <foreign lang="greek">δυνατῶν</foreign>, and it is certainly unusual to find <foreign lang="greek">ἄν</foreign> with an adjective in this way. But as <foreign lang="greek">δυνατῶν</foreign> can itself take an infinitive, it hardly differs from
            the participle <foreign lang="greek">δυναμένων</foreign>, and the suggestions <foreign lang="greek">δυνατῶν ὄντων</foreign>, or <foreign lang="greek">δυνατῶν ἂν
              &lt;ὄντων&gt;</foreign>, are unattractive. I should add in conclusion that
            nearly all critics are now agreed in holding that Plato throughout the whole of this
            passage is referring to his own experience of Dionysius I: see for example Susemihl
              <title>Gen. Entw.</title> II pp. 240, 294 ff., Teichm&uuml;ller <title>Lit.

            with Zeller^{4} II p. 413 note 1. The date of Plato's first visit to the elder Dionysius
            was in or near 388 B.C. Compare <title>Epp.</title> VII 324 A&mdash;327 D. Whether
            this epistle be genuine or not, the visit is abundantly attested, as Zeller proves (l.c.
            pp. 413&mdash;415 notes), and it is strange that J. and C. should still have doubts
            upon the subject. See also on V 473 D, VI 496 B, 499 B and infra 579 B note</p>
          <p>577B - 580C Like the city whose counterpart he is, the tyrannical man is in reality a
            slave, powerless to work his will, penniless and insatiate, full of fear and
            lamentation. A still greater depth of misery awaits him if he becomes a <pb n="334"/>
            tyrant. Imagine the piteous plight of one who is suddenly transported into a solitary
            place where he is at the mercy of his own slaves, and surrounded by free neighbours who
            make common cause with them! Such is the position of the tyrant, a prisoner in his own
            palace, tormented by longings which he can never appease. To sum up, he is the supreme
            embodiment of vice and misery, and the longer he holds sway, the worse he becomes.</p>

          <p>ff. The arguments by means of which Plato establishes his conclusion may be briefly
            described as the political argument, the psychological argument, and the metaphysical
            argument. The first (577 B&mdash;580 C) depends on the resemblance between the soul
            and the State, the second (580 C&mdash;583 A) on the threefold division of the soul
            into <foreign lang="greek">λογιστικόν, θυμοειδές</foreign>, and <foreign lang="greek">ἐπιθυμητικόν</foreign>, the third (583 B&mdash;587 B) on Plato's theory of
            Reality or Being. Now it is just these three methods of investigation, and these alone,
            which have been employed in the different parts of the dialogue, the political and
            psychological in II&mdash;IV and VIII&mdash;IX, the metaphysical in
            V&mdash;VII; and it is therefore altogether appropriate and right that Plato should
            bring them together now, and use their united forces &lsquo;in making up the last
            account.&rsquo; The sequence of the three arguments follows the usual Platonic way
            of progression from the exoteric to the esoteric, and as the ideal city culminated in
            metaphysical idealism, so it is a metaphysical argument that crowns our citadel of
            proof.</p>

            rest of this chapter aims at answering it by argument: see 579 C, D, where the
            conclusion of the reasoning is given. No satisfactory explanation of the MS reading
              <foreign lang="greek">τῷ τοιούτῳ λόγῳ σκοπεῖν</foreign> (cr. n.) has yet been
            offered. Some hold that <foreign lang="greek">τοιούτῳ</foreign> refers forward
            (&ldquo;nach folgender Regel,&rdquo; Schleiermacher, Prantl), but <foreign lang="greek">τῷ τοιούτῳ</foreign> cannot be thus used, although <foreign lang="greek">τοιούτῳ</foreign> by itself might be. Others translate &ldquo;by
            the help of such a process of reasoning as we now employ&rdquo; (J. and C. etc.). I
            doubt whether this meaning, which does not, by the way, furnish a sufficiently pointed
            antithesis to <foreign lang="greek">οἴεσθαι</foreign>, is easily conveyed by <foreign lang="greek">τῷ τοιούτῳ</foreign>. The translations &ldquo;bei einer solchen
            Untersuchung&rdquo; (Schneider), &ldquo;where the argument is of such a
            nature&rdquo; (J. and C., comparing the altogether different <foreign lang="greek">τοῖς τοιούτοις κακοῖς</foreign> in 579 C), and &lsquo;in this high
            argument&rsquo; are untenable on grammatical grounds; nor can we easily explain the
            dative as meaning &lsquo;in the interests of&rsquo; (&ldquo;videndum ne
            dativus eam rem significet, cuius gratia accurate quaerendum esse Socrates
            dicat&rdquo; Schneider). The emendations proposed are (1) <foreign lang="greek">τὼ
              τοιούτω λόγω</foreign> (Stephanus), (2) <foreign lang="greek">τὸ τοιοῦτον
            λόγῳ</foreign> or <foreign lang="greek">τὸν τοιοῦτον λόγῳ</foreign> (Ast), (3)
            fortasse <foreign lang="greek">εὖ μάλ’ ἐν κτλ.</foreign> (W. H. Thompson <title>J.
              Ph.</title> V p. 218). Did Stephanus mean by <foreign lang="greek">τὼ τοιούτω
            λόγω</foreign> something like the <foreign lang="greek">δίκαιος</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">ἄδικος λόγος</foreign> of the <title>Clouds</title>? <foreign lang="greek">τοιούτω</foreign> could not convey so much, but Stephanus was, I
            believe, on the right track when he restored <foreign lang="greek">τὼ

            D. The tyrant's splendid but awful isolation is admirably brought out by Plato: see also
            on VIII 567 B. In this respect Plato's similitude faithfully reflects the position of
            Dionysius I in Sicily and indeed, except for the support which Sparta lent him, in the
            whole Hellenic world. See Grote X p. 306 ff.</p>

            the truth in his &ldquo;per huius modi mala,&rdquo; but the dative is exactly as
            in <foreign lang="greek">τοσούτῳ πλείω</foreign>. The view that the dative is merely
            one of &lsquo;circumstance&rsquo;&mdash;an alternative suggestion in J. and

            is borrowed from the Athenian method of judging in musical or dramatic competitions.
            According to Petersen, who in his Dorpat program <hi rend="italic">&uuml;ber die
              Preisrichter der Grossen Dionysien zu Athen</hi> (1878) has carefully investigated the
            whole subject, the mode of procedure was as follows. Some time before the festival a
            number of qualified persons were selected by the <foreign lang="greek">βουλευταί</foreign> in cooperation with the <foreign lang="greek">χορηγοί</foreign>,
            and their names deposited in 10 urns, one for each <foreign lang="greek">φυλή</foreign>. On the day of the contest, one name was drawn from each urn, and the
            ten judges thereby constituted, after witnessing the performance, each wrote down in his
              <foreign lang="greek">γραμματεῖον</foreign> the order in which he arranged the
            several competitors. Of these ten judges five were next selected by lot, and the final
            verdict was given in accordance with the votes already registered by these five. The
            most important piece of evidence in support of this theory is furnished by Lysias 4. 3
              <foreign lang="greek">ἐβουλόμην δ̓ ἂν μὴ ἀπολαχεῖν αὐτὸν κριτὴν
              Διονυσίοις, &lt;&gt;ν̓ ὑμῖν φανερὸς ἐγένετο ἐμοὶ διηλλαγμένος,
              κρίνας τὴν ἐμὴν φυλὴν νικᾶν· νῦν δὲ ἔγραψε μὲν ταῦτα εἰς τὸ
              γραμματεῖον, ἀπέλαχε δέ</foreign>. In none of the ancient authorities, which are
            fully cited by Petersen, do we find the expression <foreign lang="greek">ὁ διὰ πάντων
              κριτής</foreign>: but Petersen thinks the phrase may perhaps denote any one of the
            surviving five, <hi rend="italic">who had lasted through all the stages</hi>, having
            been originally chosen by the Senate, and afterwards by lot on the two remaining
            opportunities. The singular number, according to Petersen, is generic, as in
            <title>Laws</title> 659 A, B and elsewhere. It is true of course that the matter could
            not always be brought to an immediate issue in this way; for, to take a single instance,
            in a case where there were, let us say, three competitors, the votes of the five judges
            might result in a tie between two competitors for each of the three prizes. Thus we
            might have: <figure/></p>
          <p>In such a case we must, I suppose, believe either that one of the five judges, who will
            then be <foreign lang="greek">ὁ διὰ πάντων κριτής</foreign>, had a casting vote, or
            else&mdash;and this is the more reasonable view&mdash;that C was held to be
            disqualified for the first prize, and fresh scrutinies began. Petersen's explanation is
            accepted in the main by M&uuml;ller (<hi rend="italic">Griech.
            B&uuml;hnenalt.</hi> pp. 369&mdash; 372), and, though to some extent
            conjectural, appears to me the best available, except in one point. <foreign lang="greek">ὁ διὰ πάντων κριτής</foreign> can hardly be separated from <foreign lang="greek">ὁ διὰ πάντων ἀγών</foreign>, a phrase which is quoted from Cratinus'
              <title>Panoptae</title> (<title>Fr.</title> 157 Kock), and explained as <foreign lang="greek">ὁ ἔσχατος ἀγών</foreign> in Bekker's <title>Anecdota</title> p. 91.
            10. The <foreign lang="greek">διὰ πάντων κριτής</foreign> must surely mean the judge
            of the <foreign lang="greek">διὰ πάντων ἀγών</foreign>, and if so, <foreign lang="greek">διὰ πάντων</foreign> should be similarly interpreted in both phrases.
            In <foreign lang="greek">διὰ πάντων ἀγών</foreign> it cannot mean &ldquo;der
            durch alle Stadien oder besser durch alle Collegien hindurchgegangen war&rdquo;
            (Petersen l. c. p. 24), but may possibly mean the last and greatest <foreign lang="greek">ἀγών</foreign>, as <foreign lang="greek">τὸ διὰ πασῶν</foreign> is
            the greatest interval in a scale of one octave. The expression is strangely reminiscent
            of the musical terms <foreign lang="greek">διὰ πέντε, διὰ τεττάρων, διὰ
            πασῶν</foreign> etc., and in a competition between <foreign lang="greek">χοροί</foreign>, it is natural enough that musical analogies should provide a name for
            the decisive struggle in which the claims of the competitors as it were contend with one
            another for the final victory. It will be seen that I understand <foreign lang="greek">ἀγών</foreign> in the quotation from Cratinus as referring, not to the actual
            dramatic or musical representation, but to the final struggle in which the lot
            arbitrates between the rival claims, the earlier <foreign lang="greek">ἀγών</foreign>
            being presumably that which is decided by the votes of the ten judges: so that the
            upshot of the whole matter will be that Socrates appeals to Glauco, as the Archon might
            to one of the five judges in what we may be forgiven for calling the &lsquo;grand
            finale,&rsquo; <pb n="341"/> calling on him to pronounce <foreign lang="greek">τίς
              πρῶτος κτλ.</foreign> The word <foreign lang="greek">ἀποφαίνεσθαι</foreign> is
            probably formal: cf. <title>Laws</title> 659 B and Dio Chrys. quoted by Petersen l. c.

          <p>580C - 583A A second proof may be founded on our psychological theory. Let us agree to
            call the three varieties of soul, knowledge-loving, honour-loving, and gain-loving
            respectively, and let us distinguish three corresponding varieties both of men and of
            pleasures. If you ask any three men who represent these different classes, which of the
            three lives is the most pleasurable, each will pronounce in favour of his own. Which of
            them is right? The necessary requisites for deciding this, like every other question,
            are experience, intelligence or wisdom (<foreign lang="greek">φρόνησις</foreign>), and
            argument. Now the lover of knowledge is the only one among the three in whom any of
            these qualifications are present, and he possesses them all. We therefore accept his
            verdict, and arrange accordingly, placing love of knowledge first, love of honour

          <p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">εἰς ἓν κεφάλαιον κτλ.</lemma> Plato recognised
            three varieties in <foreign lang="greek">τὸ ἐπιθυμητικόν</foreign>, corresponding
            respectively to the oligarchical, democratical, and tyrannical man (VIII 558 D note). In
            the present chapter these varieties again recede into the background. This apparent
            &lsquo;Inconsequenz,&rsquo; together with other reasons, led Krohn to suppose
            that the whole of this proof, as well as the next, was written at a different time from
            the rest of Books VIII and IX (<title>Pl. St.</title> pp. 221 ff. Cf. Pfleiderer <hi rend="italic">Zur L&ouml;sung</hi> etc. p. 75. Krohn has since retracted his view:
            see his <title>Pl. Fr.</title> p. 104). But the unity of the <foreign lang="greek">ἐπιθυμητικόν</foreign>
            <hi rend="italic">as such</hi> has never been sacrificed, since each of its varieties
            are also expressions of desire; and Plato is therefore fully justified in setting it
            over against <foreign lang="greek">φιλόσοφον</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">θυμοειδές</foreign>. To have compared each of its varieties separately with the two
            higher principles would have greatly lengthened and complicated Plato's proof; and he
              <pb n="343"/> reserves this point for another mode of treatment at a later opportunity
            (587 C note). Why does he select the word <foreign lang="greek">φιλοχρήματον</foreign>
            (s. <foreign lang="greek">φιλοκερδές</foreign>) to denote the <foreign lang="greek">ἐπιθυμητικόν</foreign> here? He wishes to find a <hi rend="italic">single</hi> word
            to contrast with <foreign lang="greek">φιλόσοφον</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">φιλόνικον</foreign> (s. <foreign lang="greek">φιλότιμον</foreign>). The word
              <foreign lang="greek">ἐπιθυμητικόν</foreign> itself is excluded, because we have
            agreed that the <foreign lang="greek">φιλόσοφον</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">φιλόνικον</foreign> have also <foreign lang="greek">ἐπιθυμίαι</foreign> of their
            own (580 D), and, as <foreign lang="greek">φιλοχρήματον</foreign> made its appearance
            in each of the three forms of <foreign lang="greek">ἐπιθυμία</foreign> (VIII 551 A,
            553 C, 555 A, 558 D, 561 A, 568 D, IX 572 C, 573 D), it is the best summary description
            available. Plato himself claims no more for it, and that is why he says <foreign lang="greek">μάλιστα ἂν εἰς ἓν κεφάλαιον ἀπερειδοίμεθα</foreign>. Cf.
            Grimmelt <hi rend="italic">de reip. Pl. comp. et unit.</hi> pp. 73 ff.</p>

        <div type="section" n="581B">
          <p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">φιλόνικον</lemma>. For the spelling of this word see
            VIII 548 C note and my note on <bibl n="Plat. Prot. 336E"><title>Prot.</title> 336
            E</bibl>. The present passage and also 586 C, D below conclusively prove that Plato
            connected the word with <foreign lang="greek">νίκη</foreign> and not with <foreign lang="greek">νεῖκος</foreign>, from which indeed it could not be derived without
            doing violence to the laws of the Greek language (cf. Schanz Vol. VI p. x). Now Plato
            certainly did not write <foreign lang="greek">νείκη</foreign>, but <foreign lang="greek">νίκη</foreign>: and it is therefore highly improbable that he wrote
              <foreign lang="greek">φιλόνεικος. φιλόνικος</foreign> has also considerable support
            from the inferior MSS of the <title>Republic.</title> The substitution of <foreign lang="greek">ει</foreign> for long <foreign lang="greek">ι</foreign> became extremely
            common in imperial times, especially in proper names derived from <foreign lang="greek">νίκη</foreign> (Meisterhans^{3} p. 49), and even <foreign lang="greek">ἐνείκων</foreign> and the like are also found on late inscriptions (e.g. CIG 1585).
            In the case of <foreign lang="greek">φιλόνεικος</foreign> the error was apparently
            established by Plutarch's time: see his <title>Ages.</title> 5. 4. The meaning
            &lsquo;lover of strife&rsquo; is often unsuitable in Plato; where it suits, it
            is secondary and derivative, for the lover of victory must also love strife: <hi rend="italic">non sine pulvere palma.</hi> For an exhaustive discussion of the
            question the student may be referred to Schmidt <title>Ethik d. alten Griechen</title> I
            pp. 386&mdash;391. While admitting that &lsquo;<foreign lang="greek">φιλόνικος</foreign> and its derivatives are far more frequent in Attic
            writers,&rsquo; Schmidt is inclined to admit the existence of <foreign lang="greek">φιλόνεικος</foreign> as a separate word, connected with <foreign lang="greek">νείκη</foreign> as a byeform&mdash;so he thinks&mdash;of <foreign lang="greek">νεῖκος</foreign>: but <foreign lang="greek">νείκη</foreign>, at least in classical
            Greek, is only a conjecture on Aeschylus <title>Ag.</title> 1378 and <title>Eum.</title>
            903: and in Plato, at all events, there is, I believe, no case in which <foreign lang="greek">φιλόνικος</foreign> does not give the meaning required by the context.</p>
          <p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ἥκιστα τούτων</lemma>: &lsquo;less than any of
            them,&rsquo; lit. &lsquo;least of these&rsquo; three <foreign lang="greek">εἴδη</foreign> of soul. There is no good reason for suspecting the text; for
            although strictly speaking the <foreign lang="greek">φιλόσοφον</foreign> can only care
            for <foreign lang="greek">σοφία</foreign>, the <foreign lang="greek">φιλόσοφος</foreign>, who presently (581 C ff.) takes the place of the <foreign lang="greek">φιλόσοφον</foreign>, is not wholly indifferent to either (582 B, C): he
            merely cares much less for them than the <foreign lang="greek">φιλόνικος</foreign> and
              <foreign lang="greek">φιλοχρήματος</foreign> do. <foreign lang="greek">τούτων</foreign> is necessary to bring out the contrast: <foreign lang="greek">ἥκιστα</foreign> alone, proposed by Baiter, or <foreign lang="greek">ἥκιστα
              πάντων</foreign> (W. H. Thompson) would express too much.</p>

              <foreign lang="greek">λέγομεν</foreign> (see cr. n.) is the reading of all MSS except
              <foreign lang="greek">ΑΠ</foreign><hi rend="italic">q</hi>^{1}, and Schneider is
            right, I think, in retaining it, not only because these three <foreign lang="greek">γένη</foreign> have been named before (IV 435 E), but still more because the
            classification was apparently a familiar one: see Stewart on Arist. l.c. For the
            orthographical error see <title>Introd.</title> &sect; 5. I take <foreign lang="greek">τριττά</foreign> as predicative: the hyperbaton is not, I think, a
            difficult one, because the stress of the voice falls on <foreign lang="greek">τριττά</foreign>, and to my ear it sounds more idiomatic than <foreign lang="greek">τὰ πρῶτα γένη τριττὰ εἶναι</foreign> would be. A possible alternative would be
            to take <foreign lang="greek">εἶναι</foreign> with <foreign lang="greek">φιλόσοφον
              κτλ.</foreign> (&lsquo;that the three primary classes of men are lovers of
            wisdom&rsquo; etc.), but this is somewhat less natural and satisfactory, in view
            especially of <foreign lang="greek">καὶ ἡδονῶν κτλ.</foreign> The words <foreign lang="greek">τὰ πρῶτα</foreign> mean &lsquo;the first&rsquo; or
            &lsquo;original,&rsquo; as in Aristotle's <foreign lang="greek">πρώτη
            ὕλη</foreign>, the Stoic <foreign lang="greek">πρῶται ἀρεταί</foreign> and the
            like: it would be possible to subdivide each of these primary classes into <foreign lang="greek">δεύτερα γένη, τρίτα γένη</foreign> etc. It should be mentioned that
            Shorey (<title>A. J. Ph.</title> VIII p. 364), reading <foreign lang="greek">λέγωμεν</foreign>, renders &lsquo;we may begin by assuming,&rsquo; but it is
            harsh to separate <foreign lang="greek">τὰ πρῶτα</foreign> from <foreign lang="greek">γένη</foreign>, and the adverbial <foreign lang="greek">τὰ πρῶτα</foreign>
            generally, if not always, refers <hi rend="italic">back</hi> to something said or done
            &lsquo;at the beginning.&rsquo;</p>
          <p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ὑποκείμενα</lemma>. The singular <foreign lang="greek">ὑποκείμενον</foreign> (see cr. n.), retained by Schneider and all other
            editors except Baiter, is questionable Greek. In such cases the adjective, participle,
            or verb agrees with the whole and not with the part. <foreign lang="greek">ὑποκείμενα</foreign> is little inferior to <foreign lang="greek">ὑποκείμενον</foreign> in authority and the corruption was easy. Cf. VIII 550 E note</p>

            &lsquo;But the lover of knowledge, said I, what value shall we suppose that he
            assigns to the other pleasures compared with that of knowing how the truth stands and
            always enjoying a kindred sort of pleasure while he learns? Will he not think them very
            far away?&rsquo; (viz. from <foreign lang="greek">ἡ τοῦ εἰδέναι</foreign>
            <pb n="345"/>
            <foreign lang="greek">κτλ.</foreign>). The <foreign lang="greek">χρηματιστικός</foreign> considers the pleasures of honour and learning <foreign lang="greek">οὐδενὸς ἀξίας</foreign>, compared with his own; the <foreign lang="greek">φιλότιμος</foreign> similarly, <hi rend="italic">mutatis mutandis</hi>;
            what then does the <foreign lang="greek">φιλόσοφος</foreign> consider <hi rend="italic">his</hi> pleasures to be compared with the others? What are his pleasures? Let us
            see. He either <hi rend="italic">knows</hi> (i.e. has learnt) the truth in any given
            instance or is getting to know (i.e. is <hi rend="italic">learning</hi>) it; his
            pleasures are therefore that of knowing and that of learning, i.e. <foreign lang="greek">τοιοῦτόν τι τῆς ἡδονῆς</foreign>, for the pleasures of learning are akin to
            those of knowing. From each of these pleasures those of gain and fame are far removed.

              <title>Rhetoric of Aristotle</title> I p. 299. It is tempting to make the verb middle
            (&lsquo;dispute with one another&rsquo;), as in <title>Laws</title> 957 D, and
            suppose that the pleasures are personified, as the two lives are in Prodicus' apologue

          <p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">μετά γε φρονήσεως</lemma> corresponds to <foreign lang="greek">φρονήσει</foreign> in 582 A. Plato is taking the three requisites in

The <foreign lang="greek">ἐμπειρία</foreign> of the <foreign lang="greek">φιλόσοφος</foreign> is alone intelligent, and, without <foreign lang="greek">φρόνησις, ἐμπειρία</foreign> is no more than a sort of <foreign lang="greek">ἄτεχνος τριβή</foreign> (<bibl n="Plat.

            indeed quite true, as Nettleship reminds us (<title>Lect. and Rem.</title> II p. 322),
            that the higher kind of man learns more from the experience which he shares with the
            lower kind without having to go through nearly the same amount of it.</p>
          <p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ἀλλὰ μὴν κτλ.</lemma> Bosanquet observes that
            &ldquo;this is perhaps a good argument to prove that the man of culture is
            preeminently competent to appraise the value of different ideals of life, but it is not
            a good argument to prove that he is a good judge of degrees of agreeable feeling in
            lives fundamentally different from his own&rdquo; (similarly Nettleship l. c. p.
            321). True; but that is not the point. Plato is attempting to prove that the <foreign lang="greek">φιλόσοφος</foreign> is the best judge, not of &lsquo;the degrees of
            agreeable feeling&rsquo; experienced, in one particular kind of life, but of the
            relative pleasure of three <hi rend="italic">different</hi> kinds of life, and his
            reasoning, granted that pleasures can be compared at all, is perfectly legitimate. Each
            of the three men pronounces his own life not merely <pb n="347"/> pleasant, but <hi rend="italic">pleasanter</hi> than those of the other two: how then are we to decide?
            Nothing but argument will help us, and the <foreign lang="greek">φιλόσοφος</foreign> is
            the only one of the triad who possesses that weapon. It should be observed that
            throughout this part of the discussion Plato takes it for granted that some kinds of
            pleasure are in point of fact more pleasant than others. At present his object is to
            discover what these are, but in the argument which is still to come (585 B ff.), he
            grapples with the metaphysical question&mdash;for to him it was a question, not of
            psychology, but of metaphysics&mdash;and attempts to shew that pleasures contain
            more or less of pleasure according as there is in them more or less of truth.</p>

          <p>583B - 585A Our third and crowning proof is as follows. All the pleasures except those
            of the wise (<foreign lang="greek">φρόνιμοι</foreign>) are untrue and impure. We must
            recognise the existence of three distinct states, viz. Pleasure and Pain, which are
            positive and opposite, and the Neutral state, which is negative and intermediate. Men
            frequently identify the intermediate condition with Pleasure; but they are mistaken when
            they do so, for there are some pleasures, e.g. those of smell, which have a positive
            character of their own. Now bodily pleasures, so-called, together with the corresponding
            pleasures of anticipation, are for the most part merely ways of escape from pain, and
            belong to the neutral <pb n="348"/> state. They are falsely judged pleasant through
            juxtaposition and contrast with positive Pain.</p>

            psychological <foreign lang="greek">λόγοι</foreign> have registered their votes, and it
            only remains for us to hear the verdict of the metaphysical, to which Plato
            characteristically assigns the greatest value (<foreign lang="greek">καίτοι
              πτωμάτων</foreign> below). See on 577 C. Plato's theory of true or pure
            and false or impure pleasures reappears in the <title>Philebus.</title> Both dialogues
            teach (1) that Pleasure consists in <foreign lang="greek">πλήρωσις</foreign>, (2) that
            the majority of bodily pleasures are not pleasures at all, but only <foreign lang="greek">λυπῶν ἀπαλλαγαί</foreign>, and (3) that there are other&mdash;true
            or pure&mdash;pleasures (e.g. smell) which are not preceded or followed by pain. The
            last generation of scholars mostly placed the <title>Republic</title> after the
              <title>Philebus.</title> I am inclined to agree with more recent critics in thinking
            it earlier (see on VI 506 B and Jackson in <title>Journal of Philology</title> XXV pp.
            65&mdash;82), but the greater degree of elaboration which marks the treatment of
            this subject in the <title>Philebus</title> may be and has been accounted for on either
            hypothesis. Aristotle also touches on the question of Mixed and Unmixed Pleasures in

            further important in the history of ethics for its clear distinction between the

            already noted by the Cyrenaics (RP^{7}. &sect; 208^{b}) and afterwards adopted by

          <p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">τὸ δὲ τρίτον κτλ.</lemma> The libations at

            following sequence: (1) to Olympian Zeus and the Olympian gods, (2) to the heroes, (3)
            to Zeus Soter. Hence the proverb <foreign lang="greek">τὸ τρίτον τῷ
            σωτῆρι</foreign>, with which Plato sometimes introduces the third or culminating stage
            in an argument, demonstration, or the like (<title>Phil.</title> and
            <title>Charm.</title> ll. cc., <title>Laws</title> III 692 A, <title>Epp.</title> VII
            340 A). In the present instance there is also an allusion to the Olympic games, as
            appears from <foreign lang="greek">Ὀλυμπικῶς</foreign>
            (&lsquo;Olympic-wise&rsquo;). Stallbaum conjectures that competitors at Olympia
            were in the habit of making their third libation &ldquo;non uni tantum <foreign lang="greek">Διὶ σωτῆρι</foreign>, sed sicuti consentaneum fuit, <foreign lang="greek">τῷ σωτῆρί τε καὶ τῷ Ὀλυμπίῳ Διί</foreign>&rdquo;: but
            there is no authority for this idea. Is Plato thinking of the <foreign lang="greek">πένταθλον</foreign>, in which it was necessary to win in three (probably leaping,
            discusthrowing, javelin-throwing) out of the five events in order to obtain the prize
            (see P. Gardner in <title>J. of H. Studies</title> I p. 217, where the evidence is
            quoted)? Schneider takes this view: but the words <foreign lang="greek">τῶν
            πτωμάτων</foreign> below make it clear that the reference is only to wrestling. The
            point manifestly is, that as in wrestling the third throw decided the contest between
            two athletes (Schol. on <bibl n="Aesch. Eum. 592">Aesch. <title>Eum.</title> 592</bibl>
            et al.), so here the <foreign lang="greek">δίκαιος</foreign> wins after he has thrice
            defeated the <foreign lang="greek">ἄδικος</foreign> (cf. also <bibl n="Plat. Euthyd. 277C"><title>Euthyd.</title> 277 C</bibl>). I think <foreign lang="greek">Ὀλυμπικῶς</foreign> is intended to suggest that the contest between
            justice and injustice is the greatest of all moral, as the Olympic was of all physical,
              <foreign lang="greek">παλαίσματα</foreign>: the victors <foreign lang="greek">ζήσουσι τοῦ μακαριστοῦ βίου δ̀ν οἱ ὀλυμπιονῖκαι ζῶσι μακαριώτερον</foreign>
            (V 465 D note). Compare <bibl n="Plat. Phaedrus 256B"><title>Phaedr.</title> 256 B</bibl>
            <foreign lang="greek">τῶν τριῶν παλαισμάτων τῶν ὡς ἀληθῶς Ὀλυμπιακῶν ἓν
              νενικήκασιν</foreign>. Plato adds the epithet <foreign lang="greek">τῷ Ὀλυμπίῳ</foreign>
            <hi rend="italic">de suo</hi>: in an Olympic contest Zeus Soter is also in the truest
            sense Olympian too, although in banquets Zeus Olympius received only the first, and not
            also the third libation. With similar and even greater emphasis on the word <foreign lang="greek">Ὀλυμπίῳ</foreign> Pindar prays for an <title>Olympic</title> victory
            for Phylacidas in the words <foreign lang="greek">εἴη δὲ τρίτον</foreign>

          <p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">οὐδὲ παναληθὴς -- καθαρά</lemma>. In what sense
            is pleasure said by Plato to be pure and true? It is pure when unadulterated by pain,
            whether antecedent, present or consequent; and there is also perhaps in Plato's use of
            the epithet &lsquo;pure&rsquo; a relic or hint of the old half<pb n="349"/>
            ceremonial, half-religious idea of &lsquo;pure from taint&rsquo;: see App. III
            and Rohde <title>Psyche</title>^{2} II pp. 281 ff. al. But in its deepest signification
            the truth or purity of Pleasure involves the ontological theory that soul and its
            sustenance (knowledge etc.) have more part in Being and Truth than Body and its food:
            the spiritual and not the material is the true. See also on 586 E and especially
            Nettleship <title>Lect. and Rem.</title> II pp. 322&mdash;327, where the farther
            bearings of Plato's theory are admirably traced.</p>

          <p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ἐσκιαγραφημένη</lemma>. See on II 365 C. Bodily
            pleasure is <foreign lang="greek">ἐσκιαγραφημένη</foreign> in the fullest sense of the
            word, because it depends on contrast and balance of pleasure with pleasure, and pleasure
            with pain (584 A), just as perspective produces its effect by the contrast of light and
            shade (586 B). Similarly in <bibl n="Plat. Phaedo 69B"><title>Phaed.</title> 69 B</bibl>
            Plato hints that the so-called virtue which consists in bartering one bodily pleasure
            for another is <foreign lang="greek">σκιαγραφία τισκαὶ οὐδὲν ὑγιὲς
              οὐδ’ ἀληθὲς ἔχουσα</foreign>, and ib. 81 B the soul is said to be <foreign lang="greek">γεγοητευμένη ὑπ’ αὐτοῦ</foreign> (sc. <foreign lang="greek">τοῦ

          <p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">τῶν σοφῶν</lemma> alludes, I believe, to Orphic or

          <p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">τοῦτο γὰρ κτλ.</lemma> The argument is as follows.
            While suffering pain, men are apt to look upon the <foreign lang="greek">ἡσυχία</foreign> from pain as the highest pleasure. Perhaps (suggests Glauco) at such
            a time the neutral state is in point of fact found positively pleasant and welcome by
            them. Socrates proceeds to shew (by a <hi rend="italic">reductio ad absurdum</hi> proof)
            that Glauco's suggestion is untenable. &lsquo;In that case,&rsquo; he argues,
              &lsquo;<foreign lang="greek">ἡσυχία</foreign> from pleasure will in like manner
            be positively painful: and thus the neutral state, which we declared to be <hi rend="italic">between</hi> the two extremes, will upon occasions be both, viz. both
            pleasure and pain.&rsquo; Glauco allows that that which is neither cannot become
            both, and Socrates proceeds: In this instance the &lsquo;both&rsquo; is a
              <foreign lang="greek">κίνησις</foreign>, and the &lsquo;neither&rsquo; a
              <foreign lang="greek">ἡσυχία</foreign>, and lies, as we have seen, between the two:
            so that it is wrong to identify the absence of pain with pleasure or the absence of
            pleasure with pain. Hence your suggestion is erroneous: <foreign lang="greek">οὐκ
              ἔστιν ἄρα τοῦτο, ἀλλὰ φαίνεται κτλ.</foreign> See below on 584 A. The argument
            is really complete when Glauco says <foreign lang="greek">οὔ μοι δοκεῖ</foreign>, but
            the words <foreign lang="greek">καὶ μὴν τό γε ἡδύ</foreign> introduce a new reason
            for refusing to identify <foreign lang="greek">ἡσυχία</foreign> with pleasure or with
            pain, by explicitly stating for the first time that pleasure and pain are each of them a
              <foreign lang="greek">κίνησις. ἡσυχία</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">κίνησις</foreign> are mutually exclusive notions. Cf. <bibl n="Plat. Phileb. 43D"><title>Phil.</title> 43 D</bibl>&mdash;44 B, where the reasoning follows nearly
            the same lines. See also next note.</p>

        <div type="section" n="583E">
          <p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ἀμφότερα -- ἡδονή</lemma>. Does Plato mean that

            time,&mdash;or only at <hi rend="italic">one</hi> time painful and at <hi rend="italic">another</hi> pleasant? According to <bibl n="Plat. Gorg. 497C"><title>Gorg.</title> 497 C</bibl> ff., in eating when hungry, drinking when thirsty
            etc., we cease from pain and pleasure simultaneously, so that in such a case the neutral
            state will appear to be both pleasant and painful. But the rest of the argument does not
            support this interpretation; and in the corresponding passage of the

          <p>585A - 586C Consider the question also in this way. Hunger, thirst etc. are modes of
            physical depletion; and Ignorance is a form of spiritual emptiness. He who partakes of
            food, and he who acquires Knowledge or Reason, are each &lsquo;filled&rsquo;;
            but which of them is the more truly &lsquo;filled&rsquo;? Knowledge and its
            kindred have more reality and truth than Food etc., Soul than Body: hence the
            acquisition of knowledge is a truer form of replenishment than the other. The resulting
            Pleasure will therefore be more true. Those who are strangers to wisdom and virtue know
            nothing of true delights, but fight with one another for delusive and unsatisfying joys.</p>

          <p>ff. 15 <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ὧδε δὲ κρῖνε κτλ.</lemma> The following
            sentences are among the most perplexing in the whole of the <title>Republic</title>, or
            indeed in the whole of Plato's writings. That the reading of the MSS is corrupt has been
            admitted by the majority of critics, and will be proved in App. VI, to which I must
            refer for a full discussion on the text and interpretation of this difficult passage.
            Here it is possible only to set down what seems to me, after a review of all the
            conditions of the problem, the least unsatisfactory solution. The emendation in the
            text, which I printed in my <title>Text of the Republic</title>, has been approved by a
            critic in <title>Hermathena</title> XXIV p. 252. We have to discover whether food, drink
            etc. participate in pure Being more than true opinion, knowledge etc.; and the answer is
            arrived at by the following steps. (1) Which <hi rend="italic">is</hi>
            more&mdash;that which is connected with the ever-like, the immortal and Truth, and
            which is itself of this nature, and found in something of this nature; or that which is
            connected with the never-like and mortal, and which is itself of this nature (never-like
            etc.) and found in something of this nature? That which is connected with the ever-like,
            says Glauco, <hi rend="italic">is</hi> more. (2) Then does the Being of the <hi rend="italic">never</hi>-like (<foreign lang="greek">ἀεὶ
            ἀνομοίου</foreign>= <foreign lang="greek">μηδέποτε ὁμοίου</foreign>)
            participate in Being at all more than the Being of Knowledge does? Certainly not
              (<foreign lang="greek">οὖν</foreign> is strictly illative: if it is true that what
            is connected with the ever-like <hi rend="italic">is</hi> more than what is connected
            with the never-like, then the Being of the never-like cannot <hi rend="italic">be</hi>
            more than Knowledge is&mdash;for Knowledge of course <foreign lang="greek">ἔχεται
              τοῦ ἀεὶ ὁμοίου</foreign>. Knowledge is in short taken as a type of that which
              <foreign lang="greek">ἔχεται τοῦ ἀεὶ ὁμοίου</foreign>). (3) Or has the Being of
            the never-like more part in <title>Truth</title> than Knowledge has? To this also the
            answer is no: [for that which is connected with the ever-like&mdash;and Knowledge is
            so&mdash;is connected also with Truth: see above <foreign lang="greek">τὸ τοῦ
              ἀεὶ ὁμοίου ἐχόμενονκαὶ ἀληθείας</foreign>]. (4) And if it has <hi rend="italic">less</hi> part in truth [as it has], it must also have less part in
            Being. [This deduces from step (3) the conclusion already implied in (2), and also paves
            the way for <foreign lang="greek">οὐκοῦν ὅλωσμετέχει</foreign>]. (5)
            Thus&mdash;since what is true of Knowledge is true of <hi rend="italic">all</hi> the
            spiritual <foreign lang="greek">γένη</foreign>, [and since food etc. are of course only
            particular examples of the <foreign lang="greek">ἀεὶ ἀνόμοιον</foreign> or
            never-like], universally (<foreign lang="greek">ὅλως</foreign>) those <foreign lang="greek">γένη</foreign> which are concerned with the care of the body have less
            part in Being and Truth than those which are concerned with the care of the soul. For a

          <p>586C - 588A The pleasures of anger, unless pursued in conformity with reason, are

            that the desires of the two lower parts of soul can attain those pleasures which are in
            the highest sense their own and true&mdash;so far as it is possible for them to have
            true pleasures at all. Now the tyrannical desires are farthest from reason, so that the
            tyrant has least pleasure. By an elaborate calculation it is shewn that the king lives
            seven-hundred and twenty-nine times more pleasantly than the tyrant; and if the just man
            so far surpasses the unjust in respect of pleasure, how much greater will be his

            Plato makes (cf. Grimmelt <hi rend="italic">de reip. comp. et unit.</hi> p. 76), and
            also remember that in the perfect city, which is the counterpart of the perfect soul,
            the lower orders found their truest pleasure in working for the common welfare under
            reason as embodied in the Guardians. The gist of the present passage is well expressed

            &ldquo;that in the most trivial satisfaction there may be a sense of serving

          <p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ὅσῳ ἀηδέστερον κτλ.</lemma> Plato loved to play
            with mathematics, and in the following passage he endeavours to give an arithmetical
            expression to the pleasures of justice and injustice. His motive in introducing this
            &ldquo;hedonistic calculus,&rdquo; as Bosanquet calls it, has been much
            discussed. The following considerations deserve attention. (1) On artistic grounds, now
            that the argument has been concluded, it is not inappropriate that Justice and
            Injustice, represented by the <pb n="359"/> King and the Tyrant, should as it were be
            weighed in the balance. The importance of <foreign lang="greek">ἀριθμεῖν, μετρεῖν,
              ἱστάναι</foreign> is constantly present to Plato's mind. See on X 602 D. (2) The
            Pythagoreans were in the habit of expressing virtues and other immaterial ideas in terms
            of numbers (see Zeller^{5} I pp. 389 ff.), and there is reason to suppose that the
            number 729 played a part in a Pythagorean calendar (588 A note). Some of the terms
            employed by Plato, such as <foreign lang="greek">τρίτη αὔξη</foreign>, are also in
            all probability of Pythagorean origin. See App. I to Book VIII pp. 279 ff. (3) The
            arithmetical method of calculation enables Plato to set forth in a very striking and
            dramatic way his own dissent from the popular estimate of the tyrant's happiness
            (Schneider). (4) When all is said we must allow that some of the steps are arbitrary,
            and that Plato's main object is to reach the significant number 729, so as to indicate
            that the king has more pleasure than the tyrant every day and every night of his life.
            There is of course an element of playfulness in the episode, and we need not suppose
            that Plato set any particular store by his calculations: but neither ought we on the
            other hand to dismiss the whole reckoning as a meaningless and foolish jest. See also on
            VIII 545 C.</p>
          <p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">τριῶν ἡδονῶν κτλ.</lemma> The three pleasures are
            those of the king, the timocrat, and the oligarch. The first variety is genuine, the
            second and third spurious: but the tyrant has &lsquo;crossed the line into the
            region beyond the spurious,&rsquo; i.e. his pleasures represent a still lower depth
            (see 571 B ff.), being in fact only <foreign lang="greek">εἴδωλα</foreign> twice
            removed of the oligarch's spurious pleasures (587 C). Schleiermacher made <foreign lang="greek">τῶν νόθων</foreign> depend partitively on <foreign lang="greek">τὸ

            defensible (cf. <bibl n="Plat. Phaedo 112B"><title>Phaed.</title> 112 B</bibl>), and
            even attractive at first sight; but <foreign lang="greek">τῶν νόθων</foreign> must be

          <p>Nicom. <title>Introd. Ar.</title> p. 117 Ast. Relatively to themselves, we reckoned the
            oligarch, democrat, and tyrant, as 1, 2, 3; but we have since found that the distance of
            the oligarch from true pleasure is in reality 3 times I: hence that of the tyrant must
            be 3 times 3, as in the line AB. We should doubtless regard the intervening numbers (4,
            5, and 7, 8) as indicating different stages in the gradual degeneration of the oligarch
            into the democrat (559 D ff.) and the democrat into the tyrant or tyrannical man (572 D
            ff.). It might seem more natural to make the distance of the tyrant from true pleasure 5
            and not 9 (King 1, Timocrat 2, Oligarch 3, Democrat 4, Tyrant 5); but (as Schneider
            reminds us) the pleasures of the Democrat and Tyrant lie <hi rend="italic">beyond</hi>
            the two spurious pleasures, so that the modulus of progression may reasonably be
            increased. Plato's chief object is however to reach the number 729, and he could not do
            so except by making a fresh departure with the oligarch.</p>
          <p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ἐπίπεδον ἄρα κτλ.</lemma> The number 9 is
              <foreign lang="greek">ἐπίπεδος</foreign>, because=3 x 3: <foreign lang="greek">εἰσὶ δὲ τῶν ἀριθμῶν οἱ μὲν ἐπίπεδοι, ὅσοι ὑπὸ δύο ἀριθμῶν
              πολλαπλασιάζονται, οἷον μήκους καὶ πλάτους· τούτων δὲ οἱ μὲν τρίγωνοι, οἱ
              δὲ τετράγωνοι κτλ.</foreign> (Theo. Smyrn. p. 31 Hiller. Cf. Gow <title>Gk
            Math.</title> p. 69 and M&uuml;ller in <title>Hermes</title> 1870 p. 394 note 1).
            This explanation, which so far agrees with that of the Scholiast, is adopted by the
            English translators and editors; but Schneider (l.c. and on p. 313 of his translation)
            holds that <foreign lang="greek">ἐπίπεδον κτλ.</foreign> invites us to raise to the
            second power not 3, but 9&mdash;the number which we are presently expected to raise
            to the <hi rend="italic">third</hi> power. The inferential <foreign lang="greek">ἄρα</foreign> seems to me in favour of the Scholiast's view, as well as <foreign lang="greek">κατὰ τὸν τοῦ μήκους ἀριθμόν</foreign> (cf. <foreign lang="greek">κατὰ τὸ μῆκος</foreign> in Theo p. 31 al.), an expression which corresponds to
              <foreign lang="greek">ἀριθμῷ</foreign> in the previous sentence while at the same
            time preparing us for <foreign lang="greek">κατὰ δὲ δύναμιν καὶ τρίτην
            αὔξην</foreign> in the next. The whole sentence is, I believe, only a way of saying
            that, if the tyrant is 3 x 3 degrees distant from true pleasure, his <foreign lang="greek">εἴδωλον</foreign> of pleasure may be represented by 9. The use of the
            mathematical term <foreign lang="greek">ἐπίπεδον</foreign> has a playful effect, both
            in itself and also because it sounds wilful and eccentric to express a number of <hi rend="italic">one</hi> &lsquo;increase&rsquo; (<foreign lang="greek">τὸν τοῦ
              μήκους ἀριθμόν</foreign>) in terms of two. <foreign lang="greek">δύναμις</foreign>= <foreign lang="greek">δευτέρα αὔξη</foreign>: cf.
            <title>Tim</title> 54 B and Cantor <title>Gesch. d. Mathem.</title> p. 178. The first
            increase (viz. of the unit or point) was <foreign lang="greek">ὁ τοῦ μήκους
            ἀριθμός</foreign>, i.e. in this case (1 x 9=) 9: by the second-and-third increases (on
            the same scale) we obtain 9 x 9 (second increase or <foreign lang="greek">δύναμις</foreign>) x 9 (third increase or <foreign lang="greek">τρίτη
            αὔξη</foreign>)=729. See App. I to Book VIII p. 279. Schneider's erroneous idea that
            the squaring of 9 has already been alluded to in <foreign lang="greek">ἐπίπεδονεἴη</foreign> leads him to take <foreign lang="greek">δύναμιν</foreign> as merely &lsquo;power&rsquo; and <foreign lang="greek">τρίτην αὔξην</foreign> as &ldquo;per epexegesin ad <foreign lang="greek">δύναμιν</foreign> additum.&rdquo; What motive induced Plato to cube the
            distance? Was it something purely fanciful, e.g. &ldquo;in order to gauge the <hi rend="italic">depth</hi> of the tyrant's misery&rdquo; (J. and C.), or because the
            king and the tyrant are themselves solid creatures (cf. Arist. Quint. <hi rend="italic">de Mus.</hi> III p. 89. 35 Jahn)? I think not. He probably intended to suggest that
            &ldquo;the degradation proceeds by increasingly wide intervals&rdquo;
            (Bosanquet), but the actual calculations are inspired by a desire to reach the total
            729. See on 588 A. <pb n="361"/></p>

            might have been dispensed with, and accordingly Herwerden brackets them. But the point
            at issue, as originally raised in Book II, was the relation between Justice and
            Injustice, not the relation between the King and the Tyrant: and before giving his final
            answer, Plato does well to remind us that the King and the Tyrant are only types of
            Justice and Injustice. Cf. <foreign lang="greek">ὁ ἀγαθὸς

          <p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">προσήκοντά γε κτλ.</lemma> 729 is twice 364 1/2,
            and Philolaus counted 364 1/2 days, and presumably therefore 364 1/2 nights in the year
            (Censor. <hi rend="italic">de die nat.</hi> 19). This explains <foreign lang="greek">ἡμέραι καὶ νύκτες</foreign>. It is not so obvious in what way the number 729 is
            related to months. On this subject J. and C. remark &ldquo;12 months in a year: 30 +
            1/3 days in a month: 12 x (30 + 1/3)= 364: 2 x 364 1/2=729.&rdquo; I can see no
            point in such a calculation. Susemihl on the other hand reminds us that Philolaus
            believed in a so-called great year of 729 months, and as Plato is following Philolaus in
              <foreign lang="greek">ἡμέραι καὶ νύκτες</foreign>, we may reasonably suppose that
            he does so in the rest of the passage, so that <foreign lang="greek">καὶ
            μῆνες</foreign> will be a reference to Philolaus' great year. See Sus. <title>Gen.
              Entw.</title> II p. 244 note 3, and on the subject of Philolaus' year of 729 months
            Zeller^{5} I p. 428 note 3. I have as yet found no evidence for supposing that Philolaus
            went a step farther and postulated a yet greater year of 729 ordinary years, but the
            words <foreign lang="greek">καὶ ἐνιαυτοί</foreign> in Plato make it probable that he
            did so. On this supposition the full explanation of <foreign lang="greek">προσήκονταἐνιαυτοί</foreign> will be</p>
          <p>days and nights=1 year.</p>
          <p>months =1 great year.</p>
          <p>years =1 greatest year.</p>
          <p>The general upshot is that the king is happier than the tyrant every day and every
            night of his life, rather than (as Bosanquet suggests) that &ldquo;one day of the

            therefore be held to favour the reading <foreign lang="greek">πλείονι</foreign>, which

          <p>588A - 589B We are now in a position to refute the thesis that Injustice combined with
            a reputation for Justice is profitable for him who is unjust. The soul may be likened to
            a composite creature &mdash;part bestial, part leonine, part human,
            &mdash;wearing the outward semblance of humanity. He who maintains that Injustice
            profits a man, holds that it is profitable to starve the human element and make strong
            the rest, and encourage strife and sedition within the soul. The advocate of Justice on
            the other hand asserts that the human element should have the mastery and bring the

          <p>589B - 591A The panegyrist of Justice is thus victorious on every count. His opponent
            will surrender when he understands that Virtue subjects the bestial to the human, nay
            rather to the element of God within us, while of Vice the opposite is true. Shall it
            profit a man to take gold unjustly and make his soul a slave? We may also define
            intemperance, selfwill, discontent, cowardice, servility and meanness, and the vulgarity
            which we associate with mechanical pursuits, in terms of our comparison. The better must
            rule the worse&mdash;such is our principle, and it is in harmony with the aims both
            of law and of the government of children.</p>

            Cf. Theogn. 601 f. <foreign lang="greek">ἔρρε, θεοῖσίν τ’ ἐχθρὲ καὶ ἀνθρώποισιν

              ποικίλον εἶχες ὄφιν</foreign>. Clement (<title>Strom.</title> IV 3. 1225 B Migne)
            is thinking of the Old Testament when he says <foreign lang="greek">ὄφις ὁ
            ἀπατεών</foreign>, but the idea is also Greek. It should also be remarked that
            expansions and amplifications like the addition of <foreign lang="greek">ὀφεῶδες</foreign> in this passage are characteristic of the style of Plato: cf. for

            read by Stobaeus (<title>Flor.</title> 9. 67) and is not in itself an error, we are
            hardly justified in resorting to excision. The subjunctive depends of course on <foreign lang="greek">ὅταν</foreign>, and <foreign lang="greek">καί</foreign> connects

            proposes to read <foreign lang="greek">οἰκείου ἐνόντος ἐν αὐτῷ</foreign>. The
            emendation is neat and gets rid of the difficulty both in <foreign lang="greek">ἔχοντος</foreign> and in <foreign lang="greek">ἐφεστῶτος</foreign>: but <foreign lang="greek">ἔχοντος ἐν αὑτῷ</foreign> appropriately recalls <foreign lang="greek">ἔχοντος ἐν αὑτῷ</foreign> above, and the genitive absolute may be
            compared with <foreign lang="greek">ἀποκριναμένου</foreign> VII 538 D, <foreign lang="greek">ἑπομένων</foreign> 586 D and <foreign lang="greek">δοκιμασθέντων</foreign>
            <title>Laws</title> 755 D. (Badham's <foreign lang="greek">δοκιμασθέντας</foreign> is

          <p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ἐφεστῶτος</lemma> is another independent genitive
            absolute. The double peculiarity is certainly unusual. Stephanus obliterates first one,
            and then both by suggesting (1) <foreign lang="greek">ἐφεστῶτα</foreign>, and (2)
              <foreign lang="greek">ἔχοντι ἐφεστώς</foreign> (intended, I suppose, as
            neuter, but the neuter should be <foreign lang="greek">ἐφεστός</foreign>: see Schanz
            Vol. II p. XII). I believe the text is sound: there is hardly any limit&mdash;
            except that required by intelligibility&mdash;to Plato's rapid changes of
            construction, and they are especially common with participles. See VI 488 D note with

            that the purpose, intention or meaning of Law is that the better should rule the worse,

            Schneider, and so also Bosanquet): cf. VI 496 C &mdash;497 A. <foreign lang="greek">ἑαυτὸν κατοικίζειν</foreign> is a pregnant and powerful phrase, which involves not
            only the idea of the <foreign lang="greek">πόλις</foreign> s. <foreign lang="greek">πολιτεία ἐν ἡμῖν</foreign> (cf. 590 E, 591 E, X 605 B, 608 B), but also perhaps a
            hint that the <foreign lang="greek">παράδειγμα ἐν οὐρανῷ</foreign> is as it were
            the <foreign lang="greek">μητρόπολις</foreign> from which our souls should be
            colonised. Jowett and Campbell understand <foreign lang="greek">ἐκεῖ</foreign> after
              <foreign lang="greek">ἑαυτὸν κατοικίζειν</foreign>, while Richards thinks Plato may
            have written <foreign lang="greek">ἑαυτὸν &lt;αὐτόσε&gt;</foreign> or
              <foreign lang="greek">&lt;εἰς αὐτὴν&gt; κατοικίζειν</foreign>: but the
            word <foreign lang="greek">παράδειγμα</foreign>, as well as <foreign lang="greek">τῷ
              βουλομένῳ ὁρᾶν καὶ ὁρῶντι</foreign>, shews that the heavenly city is regarded
            as a model for the soul rather than as the place in which the soul should be planted.
            The conjectures <foreign lang="greek">αὐτὸ</foreign> (sc. <foreign lang="greek">τὸ
              παράδειγμα</foreign>) <foreign lang="greek">κατοικίζειν</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">ὁρῶντι πρὸς</foreign> (s. <foreign lang="greek">εἰς</foreign>)
              <foreign lang="greek">αὐτὸ κατοικίζειν</foreign> (Herwerden) do not merit
            refutation. What does Plato mean by <foreign lang="greek">ἐν οὐρανῷ</foreign>? It is
            surely something more than &ldquo;harmlose popul&auml;r-theologische
            Redeweise&rdquo; (Pfleiderer <hi rend="italic">zur L&ouml;sung</hi> etc. p. 33).
            The poet Gray (who aptly reminds us of Diogenes Laertius' epitaph on Plato <foreign lang="greek">πόλιν ἤλυθεν ἥν ποθ’ ἑαυτῷ</foreign> &verbar; <foreign lang="greek">ἔκτισε, καὶ δαπέδῳ Ζηνὸς ἐνιδρύσατο</foreign> III 45) remarks
              &ldquo;<foreign lang="greek">ἐν οὐρανῷ</foreign>, that is, in the idea of the
            divinity: see the beginning of the following book.&rdquo; Apparently he understood
            the words of the Heaven of Ideas, a view which has, with various modifications and
            qualifications, found favour also with other critics (see Steinhart
            <title>Einleitung</title> p. 254 and cf. Susemihl <title>Gen. Entw.</title> II p. 248
            ff. Proclus <hi rend="italic">in Tim.</hi> 269 E seems to interpret the <foreign lang="greek">παράδειγμα</foreign> as <foreign lang="greek">τὴν ἐν οὐρανῷ
              πολιτείαν τῆς ψυχῆς</foreign>, but Plato is manifestly speaking of the <foreign lang="greek">πολιτεία τῆς πόλεως</foreign>). Others have taken <foreign lang="greek">ἐν οὐρανῷ</foreign> of the &lsquo;Weltall&rsquo; or
            Macrocosm, as if the Universe itself were one great ideal city, after whose pattern we
            should regulate the City of the Soul (see Steinhart l. c. and p. 270 with <bibl n="Plat. Tim. 47B"><title>Tim.</title> 47 B</bibl>, 90 D); but, as Schneider points
            out, we can hardly reconcile such an interpretation with VII 529 C&mdash;530 C, and
              <foreign lang="greek">ἀνάκειται</foreign> is also against it. The sentence may be
            compared with <bibl n="Plat. Plt. 297C"><title>Pol.</title> 297 C</bibl>,
            <title>Laws</title> 713 B ff. and especially 739 D, E, where the polity of the
              <title>Republic</title> is thus described: <foreign lang="greek">ἡ μέν δὴ τοιαύτη
              πόλις, εἴτε που θεοὶ ἢ παῖδες θεῶν αὐτὴν οἰκοῦσι πλείους ἑνός, οὕτω
              διαζῶντες εὐφραινόμενοι κατοικοῦσι· διὸ δὴ παράδειγμά γε πολιτείας οὐκ
              ἄλλῃ χρὴ σκοπεῖν, ἀλλ’ ἐχομένους ταύτης τὴν ὅ τι μάλιστα τοιαύτην
              ζητεῖν κατὰ δύναμιν</foreign>. We might employ this passage to explain <foreign lang="greek">ἐν οὐρανῷ ἴσως παράδειγμα</foreign>, but its tone is less elevated
            and impressive, and in particular it does not help us to understand <foreign lang="greek">τῷ βουλομένῳ ὁρᾶν καὶ ὁρῶντι</foreign>. Plato's language is
            extraordinarily suggestive, and I confess that to me, as apparently to Susemihl (l. c.
            p. 249), these words suggest, not indeed the doctrine of Anamnesis in all its bearings,
            but something of the half-religious, half-poetical atmosphere with which Plato invests
            that doctrine in the <title>Phaedrus.</title> The mysterious and haunting phrase
              <foreign lang="greek">ἐν οὐρανῷ παράδειγμα</foreign> recalls the
            &lsquo;imperial palace whence we came,&rsquo; and the whole sentence reminds us
            once again of that profound and inspiring doctrine <foreign lang="greek">ἄνθρωπος
              οὐράνιον φυτόν, οὐκ ἔγγειον</foreign>, which, as I have often pointed out,
            underlies so much of Platonism. The sister-doctrine of Immortality seems also to be
            implied, and from this point of view the Christian parallels are highly remarkable and
            significant: see for example <title>Philipp.</title> 3. 30 <foreign lang="greek">ἡμῶν
              γὰρ τὸ πολίτευμα ἐν οὐρανοῖς ὑπάρχει</foreign>, and many other passages in the
            New Testament, e.g. <title>Hebr.</title> 11. 16, 12. 23, 13. 14: 1 <title>Pet.</title>
            i. 4, 2. iii. 13. I do not venture to assert that Plato consciously and deliberately
            thought of Anamnesis and Immortality when he wrote <foreign lang="greek">ἐν
            οὐρανῷ</foreign> etc., but the words are steeped in the fragrance of these beliefs;
            and to regard the reference to heaven &ldquo;as a mere passing figure of
            speech&rdquo; (Bosanquet) seems to me to do less than justice to the wonderful depth
            and fervour of this passage.</p>
          <p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">τὰ γὰρ ταύτης κτλ.</lemma> See Nettleship
              <title>Lect. and Rem.</title> II p. 338 and <bibl n="Plat. Theaet. 173C"><title>Theaet.</title> 173 C</bibl> ff., quoted by him. Interpreted strictly and by
            themselves, the words of Plato would mean only that the philosopher will abstain from
            public and political life except when some &lsquo;divine chance&rsquo; enables
            him to exercise his true vocation. But taken in connexion with <foreign lang="greek">ἑαυτὸν κατοικίζειν</foreign> they mean more. In founding the city <hi rend="italic">within himself</hi> after the likeness of the heavenly city the
            philosopher is in <pb n="371"/> reality a true <foreign lang="greek">πολιτικός</foreign>, because he is thereby faithful to the principles of the true and
            perfect State: even while he lives, he is already in a sense a citizen of Heaven, for
            the Kingdom of Heaven is reproduced within him. In existing cities the truest
            politicians are sometimes those who abstain from politics altogether, according to <bibl n="Plat. Gorg. 521D"><title>Gorg.</title> 521 D</bibl> ff. I agree with Steinhart
              (<title>Einleitung</title> p. 254) and Christ (<title>Gr. Literaturgesch.</title> p.
            348 note 6) that Plato now speaks much less hopefully than before of the prospects of
            realising his ideal city upon earth: see on V 470 E, VI 499 C and 502 C. It is possible
            to force some of the earlier allusions into a sort of harmony with the words of this
            passage (see for example Hirmer <title>Entst. u. Komp. d. Pl. Pol.</title> pp. 637 ff.);
            but we cannot help feeling that the tone and atmosphere are very different. Steinhart
            (l.c. p. 703 note 264) traces the difference to Plato's disappointed hopes of the
            younger Dionysius. The conjecture is interesting, but even without this stimulus Plato
            may well have come to feel that his <foreign lang="greek">καλλίπολις</foreign> is
            hardly of this world (cf. <title>Laws</title> 713 B), and that its true value lies in
            the religious, political, and moral ideals which it holds before mankind. <pb n="384"/>

          <p>595A - 597E On a retrospect of our city, says Socrates, we can now see even more
            clearly than before that we did right in excluding imitative Poetry. What is Imitation?
            Examine it in the light of the Ideas, and you will find that it is the production of
            images or appearances which are third in order from Reality and Truth. There are, for
            example, three beds: (1) that which is in Nature, made, as we may say, by God: (2) that
            which the carpenter manufactures: (3) that which is the product of the painter's art.
            The first is, and must be, one: for there cannot be two Ideas of bed. We have thus two
            makers in connexion with the notion of bed: (1) a Nature-maker (<foreign lang="greek">φυτουργός</foreign>), who is God; (2) a manufacturer (<foreign lang="greek">δημιουργός</foreign>), viz. the carpenter. There is also (3) an imitator, i.e. the
            painter. Imitation is therefore concerned with a product third in sequence from Nature,
            and the tragic poet, among other imitators, is third from Royalty and Truth.</p>
          <p>ff. Book X falls into two divisions, the first (595 A&mdash;608 B) dealing with
            Poetry, the second (608 C&mdash;621 D) with Immortality and the rewards of Justice
            both here and hereafter. The second half of the Book forms a welcome supplement to
            Plato's treatment of the main thesis of the <title>Republic</title> (see on 608 C); but
            the first division is of the nature of an episode, and might have been omitted without
            injury to the artistic unity of the dialogue (cf. Hirmer <title>Entst. u. Komp. d. pl.
              Pol.</title> p. 623). It is in no sense, as supposed by Schleiermacher
              (<title>Einleitung</title> p. 55) and apparently also by Hirzel (<hi rend="italic">der
              Dialog</hi> I p. 237 note), a fulfilment of the promise held out in III 392 C; nor
            ought we to construe <foreign lang="greek">ἴσως δὲ καὶ πλείω ἔτι
            τούτων</foreign> III 394 D as a hint that the subject of Poetry is to be resumed: see
            note ad loc. Why then is the episode introduced at all? The chorizontists (such as
            Siebeck <title>Unters. zur Phil. d. Griech.</title> pp. 142 ff., Pfleiderer <hi rend="italic">zur L&ouml;sung</hi> etc. p. 34 and Brandt <hi rend="italic">zur
              Entwick. d. Pl. Lehre d. Seelenteilen</hi> p. 27), relying partly on the tone of the
            exordium, partly on <foreign lang="greek">ἀπολελογήσθω</foreign> 607 B, assert that
            Plato is replying to certain comic poets (Pfleiderer), or to Antisthenes (Brandt), who
            had presumably fallen foul of Plato's treatment of Poetry in Books II and III. Cf. also
            Zeller^{4} II p. 556 note 2. But apart altogether from the question whether the
              <title>Republic</title> was issued <hi rend="italic">en bloc</hi> or piecemeal, there
            is no actual evidence to support the presumption on which this theory rests (cf. 598 D,
            607 B notes). The Platonic dialogue, like actual conversation, is at liberty to recall,
            modify, and expand the results of a discussion apparently finished (cf. Hirzel l.c. pp.
            228&mdash;230, 236); and we have already had an incidental recurrence to the subject
            of Poetry in VIII 568 A&mdash;D. Granted that Plato wished to justify his exclusion
            of the Muses by metaphysical and psychological as well as moral and paedagogic
            arguments, the beginning of Book X is his best, and indeed, as Hirmer shews (l.c. p.
            625), his only opportunity: see on 595 B. He may well have wished to do so: for his
            dethronement of the great educator of Greece (606 E) would be sure to arouse wide-spread
            hostility, and Plato almost seems to feel that it needs further justification even to
            himself (595 B note). Cf. Hirmer l.c. pp. 624&mdash;628 and see also on 598 D, 607
            B.</p>
          <p>The student will find an excellent and exhaustive account of Plato's theory of
            Aesthetics in Walter <title>Gesch. d. Aesthetik im Altertum</title> (1893) pp.
            168&mdash;476. His attitude towards Poetry and Poets is <pb n="385"/> very fully
            discussed by Reber <title>Platon u. die Poesie</title> (1864). Heine <hi rend="italic">de rat. quae Platoni cum poet. Gr. intercedit</hi>, etc. (1880), and more recently by

              <title>Die Stellung d. Poesie in d. plat. Phil.</title> (1901). Following on the path
            marked out by Belger in his dissertation <hi rend="italic">de Arist. etiam in arte
              poetica Platonis discip.</hi> (1872), Finsler has succeeded in shewing that
            Aristotle's debt to Plato in his Theory of Poetry is far greater than is commonly
            supposed: and although the treatment of Poetry in Book X of the <title>Republic</title>
            must be confessed to be inadequate and unjust, Plato himself, as Walter and
            St&auml;hlin have recognised, furnishes us elsewhere with the materials for
            constructing a truer and more generous theory. See also on 598 E. It may be added that a
            study of the <title>Poetics</title> of Aristotle side by side with 595 A&mdash; 608
            B will enable the student to understand both Plato and Aristotle better than if he
            confines himself to either alone. See also Butcher <hi rend="italic">Aristotle's Theory

            contribution in 602 C ff.: see note ad loc. It may seem strange that Plato makes no
            reference to the metaphysical doctrine of V&mdash;VII, since he derives his first
            argument (596 A&mdash; 601 B) from the theory of Ideas: but it was unnecessary for
            him to refer to it in this connexion, because the theory is itself expressly
            re-enunciated (<foreign lang="greek">εἷδος γάρ που κτλ.</foreign> 596 A) before the

          <p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">καίτοι φιλία γε -- λέγειν</lemma>. Plato speaks
            with real feeling: no one who had so much of the poet in himself could be insensible to
            Homer's charm, and nearly every dialogue of Plato bears evidence of the affectionate
            admiration in which he held the &lsquo;first of tragic poets.&rsquo; See Heine
              <hi rend="italic">de rat. quae Platoni cum poetis Graec. intercedit</hi> pp.
            8&mdash;15. The ancients classed Plato and Homer together: <foreign lang="greek">δύο γὰρ αὗται ψυχαὶ λέγονται γενέσθαι παναρμόνιοι</foreign>, says
            Olympiodorus (<hi rend="italic">vit. Pl.</hi> 6): and Longinus remarks that of all Greek
            writers Plato was <foreign lang="greek">Ὁμηρικώτατοσἀπὸ τοῦ Ὁμηρικοῦ

            something like filial love and piety in what Plato says of Homer in this passage, and we
            may well believe that he did not part company with the friend of his childhood without
            pain. From the way in which Plato here speaks, it looks as if he feared that his heart
            might after all get the better of his head (cf. infra 605 C, D, 606 B, 607 C ff.), and
            consequently tried by new and deeper arguments to provide an

          <p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">μίμησιν κτλ.</lemma> In III 392 C ff., <foreign lang="greek">μίμησις</foreign>, in its application to Poetry, was regarded <hi rend="italic">primarily</hi> as a form of style or <foreign lang="greek">λέζις</foreign>, viz. the imitative or dramatic )( the narrative, and in this sense it
            included tragedy, comedy, and the strictly dramatic parts of epic and other poetry (394
            C). But even in Book III <foreign lang="greek">μίμησις</foreign> and its cognate
            notions have sometimes a wider application (e.g. 401 B&mdash;402 C). The following
            discussion tries to define the essential meaning of <foreign lang="greek">μίμησις</foreign> in general by its relation to the Theory of Ideas. It should be
            noted that Poetry and Art were admitted to be <foreign lang="greek">μιμήσεις</foreign>
            in Plato's day: cf. <title>Laws</title> 668 B <foreign lang="greek">τοῦτό γε πᾶς ἂν

            115&mdash;152. Walter has justly remarked (<title>Gesch. d. Aesthetik im
            Altertum</title> p. 442) that <foreign lang="greek">μίμησις</foreign>, with its
            question-begging connotation, was in many ways an unfortunate word by which to describe
            the essence of Art, though in view of what Aristotle made of it, I should not go so far
            as to say that &lsquo;Imitation is an unproductive principle, and dries up aesthetic
            life&rsquo; (ib.). If Poetry, and not Painting and Statuary, had determined the
            Greek view of Art, we should probably hear more of Creation (<foreign lang="greek">ποίησις</foreign>), and less of Imitation, in ancient discussions on aesthetics; and
            it is difficult not to regret that Plato did not select a new and more fruitful point of
            view. See also on 598 A, B.</p>

            A (see note ad loc.), so here, Plato does not try to prove the Ideal Theory, but treats
            Glauco as already a loyal Platonist. The account which Plato here gives of his Ideas has
            been widely canvassed from many different points of view. Bosanquet
            (<title>Companion</title> pp. 381 ff.) appears to me to err by interpreting it
            throughout only in terms of modern life and thought. Others refuse to regard it as
            serious, in view of the inherent difficulties, and because of Aristotle's remark
              <foreign lang="greek">διὸ δὴ οὐ κακῶς ὁ Πλάτων ἔφη ὅτι εἴδη ἔστιν
              ὁπόσα φύσει</foreign>

            Bonitz's note. Others, again, like Krohn (<title>Pl. St.</title> pp. 242 ff.), hold that
            the Ideal Theory in Bk X is inconsistent with the theory expounded in V&mdash;VII,
            where we do not hear of Ideas corresponding to concrete and artificial objects, but only
            of Ideas of qualities (such as Justice) and the like. In reply to the last school of
            critics, we may point out that Plato is not bound to give an exhaustive account of the
            Ideal theory whenever he has occasion to make use of it. On the previous occasion he
            confined himself to Ideas of the virtues etc., because they only were relevant to his
            immediate purpose (see on V 476 A and cf. Grimmelt <hi rend="italic">de reip. Pl. comp.
              et unit.</hi> pp. 81 ff., Hirmer l.c. pp. 646 ff. and D&uuml;mmler <hi rend="italic">zur Comp. d. Pl. St.</hi> p. 14), and it is exactly the same reason
            which makes him cite Ideas of concrete and artificial objects in Book X. The view that
            Plato should not be taken seriously is as old as Proclus, who (<hi rend="italic">in
            Tim.</hi> 104 F) observes <foreign lang="greek">οὐ γὰρ κατά· τινας ἰδέας ὁ
              τεχνίτης ποιεῖ ἃ ποιεῖ, εἰ καὶ δοκεῖ τοῦτο λέγειν ὁ ἐν Πολιτείᾳ

              περὶ αὐτῶν τῶν ἰδεῶν</foreign>, but, apart from other considerations, the
            recurrence of the same form of the theory in other dialogues (see on 596 B, C) justifies
            us in taking Plato here also at his word. The history of the controversy is ably
            reviewed by Dr Beckmann (<title>Num Plato artefactorum ideas statuerit</title>, Bonn
            1889), with whom and with Zeller^{4} II pp. 666, 701 al. I agree in believing this
            passage to be an authoritative exposition of the Ideal theory on one of its many sides.</p>
          <p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">εἶδος γάρ που κτλ.</lemma>: &lsquo;for we are,
            as you know, in the habit of assuming a certain idea&mdash;always <hi rend="italic">one</hi> idea&mdash;in connexion with each group of particulars to which we apply
            the same name&rsquo;: lit. &lsquo;an Idea, one each&rsquo; i.e. each being
            one. There cannot be two or more Ideas of Bed for example: cf. 597 C. Unnecessary
            trouble has been raised about the translation of this sentence by Krohn (<title>Pl.
            St.</title> p. 240), whose version &ldquo;in Bezug auf jedes der vielen Dinge nehmen
            wir je. eine Einheit als <foreign lang="greek">εἶδός τι</foreign> an&rdquo; is
            both strained and inaccurate. For the statement itself cf. V 476 A, 479 A, B, E, 480 A,
            VI 493 E and VII 507 B note Plato <hi rend="italic">might</hi> have written any of the
            foregoing passages without believing in Ideas of anything beyond qualities and
            attributes: but that he <hi rend="italic">did</hi> believe in other Ideas also is
            evident not only from Book X, but also from <bibl n="Plat. Phileb. 15A"><title>Phil.</title> 15 A</bibl>, 16 C, D and many other places quoted by Zeller^{4}

          <p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">πολλαί πού εἰσι κλῖναι κτλ.</lemma> Why does
            Plato select examples of artificial objects, when the Painter can equally well paint the
            features of Nature, as is virtually allowed in C? One reason is that otherwise he could
            not have constructed the descending scale <foreign lang="greek">θεός, κλινοποιός,
              ζῳγράφος</foreign> 597 B ff. Had he selected e.g. mountains, it would be difficult
            to specify the middle term. Moreover in <bibl n="Plat. Soph. 266B"><title>Soph.</title>
              266 B</bibl> ff. we have a distinction drawn between <foreign lang="greek">θεία</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">ἀνθρωπίνη εἰδωλοποιική</foreign>, the
            first producing likenesses of natural objects by natural agencies, the <pb n="388"/>
            second likenesses of artificial objects by artificial means, and Painting is there also
            classed under the second head: <foreign lang="greek">τί δὲ τὴν ἡμετέραν τέχνην;
              ἆῤ οὐκ αὐτὴν μὲν οἰκίαν οἰκοδομικῇ φήσομεν ποιεῖν, γραφικῇ δέ τιν̓
              ἑτέραν, οἷον ὄναρ ἀνθρώπινον ἐγρηγορόσιν ἀπειργασμένην;</foreign> (266 C).
            Inasmuch as <foreign lang="greek">σκευαστά</foreign> are elsewhere credited with less
            reality than <foreign lang="greek">φυτευτά</foreign> (see on VII 532 B, C notes), the
            choice of these examples is also specially appropriate to Plato's main object, that is
            to say, the depreciation of imitative art.</p>

              Ideenlehre in Pl. Rep. u. Phil.</hi> p. 25 note 68). We are not entitled (in view of
            597 B and the phraseology of the present passage) to take <foreign lang="greek">ἰδέαν</foreign> merely as the plan or form of bed in the mind of the carpenter: the
            Ideas of <foreign lang="greek">σκευαστά</foreign> must be credited with the same

            although the difficulties which such a view involves are undeniably greater in the one
            case than in the other. If we put ourselves in Plato's position&mdash;and Socrates
            is here speaking as one Platonist to another (<foreign lang="greek">εἰώθαμεν

            is important, in view of 598 C ff., to insist that there is <hi rend="italic">nothing</hi> which the Painter and Poet cannot &lsquo;make&rsquo;: hence the

            phrase <foreign lang="greek">ἐν τῇ φύσει</foreign>, the expression <foreign lang="greek">ἡ φύσις</foreign> means &lsquo;Nature&rsquo; i.e. <hi rend="italic">rerum natura</hi> (cf. R. G. Bury in <title>Cl. Rev.</title> VIII p.
            299), but for Plato <hi rend="italic">rerum natura</hi>, strictly interpreted, is the
            Ideal World. Plato's nomenclature is in harmony with the traditional usage of Greek
            philosophy, for &ldquo;in Greek philosophical language, <foreign lang="greek">φύσις</foreign> always means that which is primary, fundamental, and persistent, as
            opposed to that which is secondary, derivative, and transient&rdquo; (Burnet
              <title>Early Greek Phil.</title> p. 11). Now in Platonism the primary, fundamental,
            persistent, is the <foreign lang="greek">εἶδος</foreign>: and hence the <foreign lang="greek">φύσις</foreign> or &lsquo;nature&rsquo; of anything means its
            Idea (e.g. <bibl n="Plat. Phaedrus 254B"><title>Phaedr.</title> 254 B</bibl>
            <foreign lang="greek">ἡ μνήμη πρὸς τὴν τοῦ κάλλους φύσιν ἠνέχθη</foreign>), and
            the <foreign lang="greek">φύσις</foreign> or nature of <hi rend="italic">all</hi>
            things (<hi rend="italic">rerum natura</hi>) becomes an expression for the World of
            Ideas (&ldquo;regio idearum, <foreign lang="greek">ὁ νοητὸς
            τόπος</foreign>&rdquo; Schneider). Bosanquet would like to render <foreign lang="greek">φύσις</foreign> by &lsquo;evolution,&rsquo; &ldquo;without
            understanding any definite theory of origins.&rdquo; Such a translation would be, in
            my judgment, not only gravely misleading, but linguistically wrong; for <foreign lang="greek">ἐν τῇ φύσει οὖσα</foreign> cannot mean &lsquo;which evolution
              <hi rend="italic">has produced</hi>&rsquo;: the force of <foreign lang="greek">ἐν</foreign> must be local&mdash;figuratively so, of course&mdash; exactly as
            in <foreign lang="greek">ὥσπερ παραδείγματα ἑστάναι ἐν τῇ φύσει</foreign>
            referred to above. So also J. B. Mayor in <title>Cl. Rev.</title> X p. 121. To Krohn,
              <foreign lang="greek">φύσις</foreign> appears to be &ldquo;die allgemeine
            Gesetzlichkeit des Universums, die dem <foreign lang="greek">δημιουργός</foreign> die
            Musterbilder liefert&rdquo; (<title>Pl. St.</title> p. 249). This is nearer the
            truth, but we must not surrender the self-existence of the Ideas. See also on 597 D.</p>
          <p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ἣνθεὸν ἐργάσασθαι</lemma>.
            &ldquo;Occurrit, ut videtur, quasi ex improviso Platoni, Deum Idearum auctorem
            appellare&rdquo; says Pansch (<hi rend="italic">de deo Platonis</hi> p. 45), truly
            enough, in the restricted sense that we ought to lay no stress on this passage <hi rend="italic">by</hi>
            <pb n="391"/>
            <hi rend="italic">itself</hi> as evidence for the origin of the Ideas. But, if God and
            the Idea of Good are the same (see on VI 505 A ff.), Plato is merely saying in
            theological language what he formerly said in philosophical, when he derived the
              <foreign lang="greek">οὐσία</foreign> of all other Ideas from the Idea of Good (VI
            509 B). See Krohn <title>Pl. St.</title> p. 242, where the same explanation is given,
            and Zeller^{4} II p. 666. It is not, I think, quite correct to dismiss <foreign lang="greek">θεός</foreign> as merely &ldquo;eine mythische
            Ausdrucksweise&rdquo; (Hirmer <title>Entstehung u. Komp.</title> etc. p. 647), and
            Susemihl (<title>Einleitung</title> p. 262) is certainly wrong when he takes it to mean
              &lsquo;<hi rend="italic">a</hi> god.&rsquo; The sentence has been much
            discussed in connexion with the theory that Plato's Ideas are &lsquo;thoughts of
            God&rsquo;: see for example Hermann <hi rend="italic">de loco Plat. de rep.</hi> VI
            505 sq. p. 5 with Bonitz's reply <title>Disput. Pl. duae</title> p. 33 and Hermann's

            664&mdash; 670. I have already said in App. III to Book VII that Plato himself says
            nothing to shew that he viewed his Ideas in this light; and it is only by reading into
            his words much more than they are naturally fitted to convey, that the present passage
            can be made to support the identification.</p>

            second a carpenter. <foreign lang="greek">φυτουργός</foreign> is used by Plato in the

            the bed-by-nature, the table-by-nature, etc.; and the peculiar form of Glauco's answer
              (<foreign lang="greek">δίκαιον γοῦν κτλ.</foreign>) shews that he was sensible of
            the linguistic experiment. Plato's meaning would have been easier for us to catch if
            (using substantives instead of pronouns), he had said <foreign lang="greek">μίαν φύσει
              κλίνην ἔφυσεν</foreign> (created one bed-by-nature, cf. VI 501 B <foreign lang="greek">τὸ φύσει δίκαιον</foreign>) and <foreign lang="greek">ἐπειδήπερ καὶ

            nature (i.e. the Idea) of the thing in q&lt;*&gt; tion. Schleiermacher,
            Schneider, &lt;*&gt; M&uuml;ller, to judge from their

            C. Plato's procedure in reasoning from Painting to Poetry (cf. infra 598 C, 601 A, 603 B
            and 605 A) may be illustrated by Simonides' remark that &lsquo;Poetry is vocal
            Painting,&rsquo; as &lsquo;Painting is silent Poetry&rsquo; (<foreign lang="greek">ὁ Σιμωνίδης τὴν μὲν ζῳγραφίαν ποίησιν σιωπῶσαν προσαγορεύει,

          <p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">τρίτος τις κτλ.</lemma>: &lsquo;as it were third
            from King and Truth.&rsquo; The metaphor is a genealogical one (cf. III 391 C
              <foreign lang="greek">Πηλέως, σωφρονεστάτου τε καὶ τρίτου ἀπὸ
            Διός</foreign>), and the King corresponds of course to the <foreign lang="greek">φυτουργός</foreign> or God. On the one hand we have (1) God, (2) the <foreign lang="greek">τέκτων</foreign>, (3) the <foreign lang="greek">μιμητής</foreign>: on
            the other (1) the <foreign lang="greek">αὐτὸ ὃ ἔστι κλίνη</foreign>, (2) a
            material <foreign lang="greek">κλίνη</foreign>, (3) a picture of a material <foreign lang="greek">κλίνη</foreign>: and just as the picture is <foreign lang="greek">τὸ
              τρίτον γέννημα ἀπὸ τῆς φύσεως</foreign>, so the imitator is &lsquo;third in
            descent&rsquo; (<foreign lang="greek">τρίτος  πεφυκώς</foreign>) and
            consequently two degrees removed from <foreign lang="greek">ὁ θεός</foreign>. The
            propriety of the term <foreign lang="greek">βασιλέως</foreign> will be seen if we
            translate Plato's theological phraseology into its philosophical equivalent. When he
            tells us that God constructs the Idea of Bed, he means that the Idea of Good is the
            source of that Idea (597 B note), and the Idea of Good is <title>King</title> of the
            Ideal World: see VI 509 D. This is the application of the phrase: but it is possible
            enough that the expression itself was half-proverbial in Plato's time, and referred
            originally to the person who stood next but one in order of succession to the Persian
            throne. See App. I. The general sense is well illustrated by J. and C. from Dante <hi rend="italic">In-</hi>

            to a mere mechanical copyist, whose intelligence does not rise above <foreign lang="greek">εἰκασία</foreign> (in the sense of VI 511 E: see note ad loc. and App.
            I to Book VII). Yet the highest art has in every age claimed to portray, not the
            so-called actual, but the Ideal: see for example Arist. <title>Poet.</title> 25. 6 and
            17: &ldquo;It may be impossible that there should be men such as Zeuxis painted.
            &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; we say, &lsquo;but <hi rend="italic">the impossible is
              the higher thing; for the ideal type must surpass the
            reality</hi>&rsquo;&rdquo; (Butcher's translation), and the recent development
            of this idea by W. J. Courthope, <title>Life in Poetry and Law in Taste</title> pp. 152,
            165, 196 ff. and passim. In the present passage, Plato bases his unfavourable verdict on
            what must be admitted to be a narrow and scholastic interpretation of his own ontology,
            but in view of Books II and III as well as 605 C&mdash; 607 A below, we can hardly
            doubt that his attitude was determined in the first instance by educational rather than
            by metaphysical considerations, and that throughout the whole of Book X he was thinking
            less of the inherent possibilities of Art, than of actual Greek Art and Poetry
            considered as the exponents of a moral and religious creed which Plato himself
            emphatically disowns. See also on 607 A. In any case, the objections which he here urges
            do not touch the real essence of any form of Art except pure and unadulterated realism.
            Elsewhere throughout the Platonic writings there are not wanting indications of a juster
            estimate of the artistic faculty and its possibilities (see for example III 401
            B&mdash;403 C, and especially V 472 D, and cf. Walter <title>Gesch. d. Aesthetik im
              Altertum</title> pp. 441 ff., 459 ff. and St&auml;hlin <title>Stellung d. Poesie
              in d. Plat. Phil.</title> pp. 56&mdash;65), and the sympathetic student of Plato
            will find it easy to construct a nobler and more generous theory of Aesthetic Art out of
            the doctrine of Ideas together with its corollaries of <foreign lang="greek">ἀνάμνησις</foreign> and pre-existence. It is also a historical fact that Plato's own
            conception of a transcendent self-existing Beauty, <foreign lang="greek">ἀεὶ ὂν καὶ
              οὔτε γιγνόμενον οὔτε ἀπολλύμενον, οὔτε αὐξανόμενον οὔτε φθίνον, ἔπειτα
              οὐ τῇ μὲν καλόν, τῇ δ’ αἰσχρόν, οὐδὲ τοτὲ μέν, τοτὲ δ’ οὔ, οὐδὲ
              πρὸς μὲν τὸ καλόν, πρὸς δὲ τὸ αἰσχρόν</foreign> (<bibl n="Plat. Sym. 211A"><title>Symp.</title> 211 A</bibl>), has proved an inexhaustible fountain of
            inspiration to some of the greatest artists, notably, for instance, in connexion with
            the Platonic Academy at Florence in the days of Michel Angelo: see Symonds,
              <title>Renaissance in Italy</title> II pp. 205, 207, 247, 323 ff. Those who have
            caught the spirit of Plato's teaching will agree with me when I say that the famous
            lines of Wordsworth on King's College Chapel</p>
          <p>&ldquo;They dreamt not of a perishable home, Who thus could build,&rdquo;</p>
          <p>are more truly and characteristically Platonic than Plato's attack upon poetry and
            painting in this passage.</p>
          <p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ἆρα οἷα ἔστιν κτλ.</lemma> The painter, as
            Bosanquet reminds us, operates in two dimensions, and so cannot copy the material bed

            is <foreign lang="greek">σκιαγραφία</foreign> (II 365 C note). It will follow that
            Painting is a stage lower than &lsquo;third from truth,&rsquo; but Plato does
            not press the point, and in 599 A and D Poetry&mdash;the sister art to
            Painting&mdash;remains as before only <foreign lang="greek">τρίτον ἀπὸ τῆς

            apologist of Art might fairly reply to Plato that in another and profounder sense it is
            just because Art does &lsquo;imitate&rsquo; the <foreign lang="greek">φάντασμα</foreign> and not the material reality that her creations frequently possess
            a measure of ideality and truth beyond and above what Plato assigns to them here. Cf.

              d. Poesie</title> etc. p. 26) takes this as a specific reference to Antisthenes.
            Antisthenes, in the first place, denied the Ideal theory and held that there could be no
            knowledge except of particulars: so that Plato might well insinuate that he was
            incapable of distinguishing knowledge from ignorance: cf. V 476 D note In the second
            place, Antisthenes was a champion of Homer, and discovered a sort of moral philosophy in
            his works (see <title>Frag.</title> 24&mdash;28 in Winckelmann <title>Antisth.
            Frag.</title> and Zeller^{4} II pp. 330 ff.). On the strength of these two facts
            St&auml;hlin has evolved the ingenious theory that Plato's motive throughout this
            part of the discussion is a purely polemical one, and that he did not seriously consider
            Poetry only &lsquo;third from Royalty and Truth.&rsquo; Plato, thinks
            St&auml;hlin, says in effect: &lsquo;Antisthenes holds that poets have knowledge
            of and copy particulars; but there is no knowledge of particulars, and particulars are
            copies of Ideas, so that on Antisthenes's own shewing Poets are ignorant, and Poetry is
            thrice removed from Truth: whereas Antisthenes thinks Homer was omniscient.&rsquo;
            The dagger is only lath: for Antisthenes was not an Idealist. Yet it is tolerably clear
            that Plato is refuting a view of poetry which found enthusiastic advocates in his own
            time, and Antisthenes may have been one of these, though the evidence falls far short of
            proof (see next note): but the purpose of this investigation is certainly not polemical
            and nothing more, and in spite of other passages in which Plato takes a more generous
            view of Poetry (see on 598 E), there is no good reason to suppose that his hostility is
            otherwise than serious here. See also on line 28.</p>
          <p>598D - 601B We hear it said that tragedians, including Homer, have knowledge of that
            whereof they write; but it is not so. No one would seriously give himself to the
            production of copies if he could make originals. If the poet possessed true knowledge of
            what he imitates, he would rather do great deeds than sing of them; and Homer rendered
            no services to his fellow men in the sphere of action, <pb n="396"/> invention, or even
            education, as the neglect he suffered in his own lifetime abundantly proves. The fact is
            that the Poet writes without knowledge. His productions are but images of images, and
            owe all their charm to their poetic setting.</p>
          <p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">τὸν ἡγεμόνα αὐτῆς Ὅμηρον κτλ.</lemma> See 595
            C note In <foreign lang="greek">τινων</foreign> D&uuml;mmler and St&auml;lhlin
            (ll. cc.) again recognise Antisthenes, but although Antisthenes seems to have believed
            in Homer, there is no evidence that he was a champion of Tragedy (note <foreign lang="greek">ὅτι οὗτοι κτλ.</foreign>); and he was certainly not the only person
            in whose eyes Homer was regarded as at once a universal genius and the educator of the
            whole of Greece. It is not necessary to suppose that Plato has any individual person in
            his mind: there must have been many such apologists of Homer and dramatic poetry in
            Plato's day, and Plato as usual individualizes the type. See for instance the
            <title>Ion</title> of Plato and <bibl n="Aristoph. Frogs 1008">Ar. <title>Frogs</title>
            1008</bibl> ff. It will, no doubt, help us to appreciate Plato's attitude towards Poetry
            if we remember that she was the <hi rend="italic">de facto</hi> rival of Philosophy, and
            that (as Munk observes, <hi rend="italic">die nat. Ordnung d. Plat. Schr.</hi> pp. 313
            ff.) the <title>Republic</title> is in a certain sense a demand that Philosophy shall
            take the place which Poetry had hitherto filled in educational theory and practice: see
            especially the address to poets in <title>Laws</title> 817 A ff. <foreign lang="greek">ὦ ἄριστοιτῶν ξένων, ἡμεῖς ἐσμεν τραγῳδίας αὐτοὶ ποιηταὶ

            to suppose that Plato was actuated by any feeling of personal jealousy towards Homer,
            and aspired to supplant him in the admiration of his countrvmen: &lsquo;there is no
            envy in the choir divine&rsquo; (<bibl n="Plat. Phaedrus 247A"><title>Phaedr.</title>
              247 A</bibl>). There is something almost pathetic in Dionysius' inability to
            understand and appreciate Plato when he assures us with monotonous and feeble iteration
            that &lsquo;there was, there really was in Plato's nature, with all its excellences,
            something of vainglory. He shewed this particularly in his jealousy of Homer, whom he
            expels from his imaginary commonwealth after crowning him with a garland and anointing
            him with myrrh&rsquo; (<title>Letter to Pompeius</title> &sect; 756, translated

            suppose (with D&uuml;mmler and St&auml;hlin, ll. cc.) that Antisthenes alone is
            intended, for Plato seems to be alluding to a tolerably widespread view and one which
            was freely represented in Apologies of Poetry. Understood in its full significance, the
            theory of Poetry which Plato is here combating requires us to believe that a poet who
            can represent a general, a pilot etc., knows the art of generalship, pilotage etc. (cf.
            599 C ff.), and we are told that Sophocles was actually made <foreign lang="greek">στρατηγός</foreign> because of his <title>Antigone</title> (see the Argument
            ascribed to Aristophanes the grammarian). If we realise the part which Poetry, and
            especially the poetry of Homer, played in Greek education, and remember that
            Aristophanes makes Homer the teacher of <foreign lang="greek">τάξεις, ἀρετάς,
              ὁπλίσεις ἀνδρῶν</foreign>, it is by no means extra<pb n="397"/> vagant to suppose
            that such views were actually maintained in Plato's time, though Pericles for example
            had a different criterion of strategic ability when he told Sophocles that he
            &lsquo;knew how to write poetry, but not how to command an army&rsquo; (<foreign lang="greek">Περικλέης ποιέειν με ἔφη, στρατηγέειν δ’ οὐκ
            ἐπίστασθαι</foreign> Athen. XIII 604 D). Cf. <title>Ion</title> 540 B&mdash;542 B

            public,&rsquo; remarks St&auml;hlin, &lsquo;whose views Plato here combats,
            allowed the authority of the poets to extend even to the domain of the particular arts.
            It was Plato who broke through this magic circle which surrounded Poetry.&rsquo;
            Aristotle followed in the same path, refusing to allow that a mistake in respect of some
            particular art is necessarily a flaw in the poetry: see <title>Poet.</title> 25.
            1460^{b} 20 ff., 33 ff. Plato himself, of course, holds that poets are destitute of
            scientific knowledge, and compose their poems <foreign lang="greek">οὐ σοφίᾳ, ἀλλὰ

            instead of it intuition, enthusiasm and inspiration: he is in short <foreign lang="greek">ἔνθεος</foreign>, because <foreign lang="greek">ἐπίπνους ὢν καὶ
              κατεχόμενος ἐκ τοῦ θεοῦ</foreign> (<title>Men.</title> l.c.). This view of Poetry
            is of course earlier than Plato: we meet with something like it in a striking fragment
            of Democritus ap. Dio Chrys. LIII 274 (quoted by St&auml;hlin l.c. p. 12) <foreign lang="greek">Ὅμηρος φύσεως λαχὼν θεαζούσης ἐπέων κόσμον ἐτεκτήνατο
              παντοίων</foreign>, and Pindar likes to represent himself as the inspired mouthpiece
            of the Muses and Apollo. We cannot attain to a correct conception of Plato's aesthetic
            unless we are careful to remember that, although he refused to allow that the poet has
            knowledge, he did not deny him genius and inspiration. See also on 598 A supra.</p>

            &lsquo;to set before his life&rsquo; as an aim or goal. In itself, this

            the same feeling: cf. Plato's remarks on the effects of over-much feeding and athletics
            in III 411 C&mdash;E <foreign lang="greek">μισόλογος δή, οἶμαι, ὁ τοιοῦτος
              γίγνεται καὶ ἄμουσος</foreign>, and Euripides <bibl n="Plat. Fr. 284D"><title>Frag.</title> 284 D</bibl>indorf, with the comic fragment <foreign lang="greek">παχεῖα γαστὴρ λεπτὸν οὐ τίκτει νόον</foreign>. Plato means that the
            proof of the pudding is in the eating: Homer must have been a poor teacher if his
            disciples (including Creophylus) learnt so little. Had he taught them successfully they
            would have proved their <foreign lang="greek">παιδεία</foreign> by treating their
            master more respectfully: cf. <bibl n="Plat. Gorg. 519C"><title>Gorg.</title> 519
            C</bibl>, D, where we are told that if teachers of <foreign lang="greek">δικαιοσύνη</foreign> do not get paid by their pupils, it only shews that they have
            failed to teach their subject and therefore deserve no fees. <foreign lang="greek">λέγεται ἔζη</foreign> means &lsquo;for it is said that he was much
            neglected even in his own age, when he was <hi rend="italic">alive</hi>,&rsquo;
            whereas it is precisely during his lifetime that he would have been most respected if he
            had taught to any purpose: witness the enthusiasm aroused by Protagoras, Prodicus and
            other teachers! Thus understood, <foreign lang="greek">ὅτε ἔζη</foreign> has a
            strong rhetorical emphasis and ought not to be discarded (with Cobet, Baiter, and
            Herwerden). For <foreign lang="greek">ἐκείνου</foreign> after <foreign lang="greek">αὐτοῦ</foreign> referring to the same person cf. VII 538 B and Riddell
              <title>Digest of Platonic Idioms</title> p. 143 &sect; 49. If we adopt Ast's
            conjecture and read <foreign lang="greek">ὑπ’ αὐτοῦ ἐκείνου</foreign>, the passage
            gains a little in point, because <foreign lang="greek">αὐτοῦ ἐκείνου</foreign> will
            then refer to Creophylus: but it is difficult to make the subject of <foreign lang="greek">ἔζη</foreign> different from the antecedent of <foreign lang="greek">αὐτοῦ ἐκείνου</foreign>, and on the whole I no longer think there is any good
            reason for deserting the MSS.</p>

            so that it cannot be, as Erasmus (quoted by Ast) imagined,
            &ldquo;translatum&mdash;a matribus ac nutricibus, quae infantulos cunis

            authority) or <foreign lang="greek">ὀνῆσαι</foreign> (Stallbaum, after one MS of
            Aristides II p. 432). <foreign lang="greek">ὀνῆναι</foreign> is a very dubious
            formation, and the present gives a better meaning than the aorist. The error arose from
            lipography of <foreign lang="greek">-να-</foreign>: and <foreign lang="greek">ὀνεῖναι,
              ὀνῆναι</foreign> look like attempts to make the residue into an infinitive.</p>

            the <foreign lang="greek">μέτρον</foreign>, but the <foreign lang="greek">μῦθος</foreign> which appeared to him to be the most essential part of poetry (e.g.
              <bibl n="Plat. Phaedo 61B"><title>Phaed.</title> 61 B</bibl>
            <foreign lang="greek">ἐννοήσας ὅτι τὸν ποιητὴν δέοι, εἴπερ μέλλοι ποιητὴς

              Alt.</title> pp. 460, 463). Whether Plato would have spoken of a prose romance as a
            poem, is another question, and the passages to which I have referred make it unlikely
            that he would have done so. Aristotle seems to attach less importance than <pb n="403"/>
            Plato to the metrical form: see <title>Poet.</title> 1. 1447^{b} 17 ff. <foreign lang="greek">οὐδὲν δὲ κοινόν ἐστιν Ὁμήρῳ καὶ Ἐμπεδοκλεῖ πλὴν τὸ

            Aristotle could have said with Sir Philip Sidney &lsquo;One may be a poet without
            versifying,&rsquo; although he would certainly not quarrel with the converse
            statement that &lsquo;one may be a versifier without poetry.&rsquo; See on the

          <p>601B - 602B The condition of Imitative art in respect of knowledge may be apprehended
            in the following way. In connexion with every object we can distinguish three arts, that
            which uses, that which makes, and that which imitates it. The user alone has knowledge
            of the object; the maker, when the user instructs him, has correct opinion; but neither
            knowledge nor correct opinion can be attributed to the imitator. He merely copies what
            appears to be beautiful to the ignorant multitude.</p>
          <p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ἴθι δή, τόδε ἄθρει κτλ.</lemma> Plato has
            already proved that Imitation is &lsquo;third from Truth&rsquo; <foreign lang="greek">ἐκ τῆς εἰωθυίας μεθόδου</foreign> (596 A), i.e. from the ontological
            standpoint provided by his own Ideal Theory. The following argument takes up a different
            standpoint, according to which knowledge is defined as <foreign lang="greek">ἐμπειρία</foreign> or practical familiarity (601 C, D, 602 A). The attitude assumed
            throughout this section resembles in some respects that of the historical Socrates (601
            D note). Can the two points of view be reconciled? Bosanquet makes an interesting
            attempt to do so (pp. 379, 389 ff.), but his misconception (as it seems to me) of
            Plato's Ideas renders his conclusions less valuable than they might otherwise have been.
            Krohn (<title>Pl. St.</title> p. 255) professes himself unable to effect a
            reconciliation. We must admit that Plato himself does not, as a matter of fact,
            endeavour in this passage to connect the two arguments. Had he chosen to make the
            effort, I think a careful study of <bibl n="Plat. Euthyd. 288E"><title>Euthyd.</title>
              288 E</bibl>&mdash; 290 D and <bibl n="Plat. Crat. 390B"><title>Crat.</title> 390
              B</bibl>&mdash;E will shew on what lines he might have proceeded (see on <foreign lang="greek">ἐμπειρότατον</foreign> in 601 D), but it is safer to suppose that he
            has shifted his ground, and is applying a new and less strictly scientific <foreign lang="greek">μέθοδος</foreign> to shew that the Imitator is third from knowledge, as
            Imitation is from truth.</p>

          <p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ἐμπειρότατον</lemma>. Throughout the whole of this

            metaphysical significance to the word &lsquo;knowledge,&rsquo; which he often
            employs throughout his writings without any suggestion of the Ideas (e.g. II 374 D, IV
            422 C). There is no doubt a certain sense in which &mdash;if we have regard to <bibl n="Plat. Crat. 390B"><title>Crat.</title> 390 B</bibl> ff. and <bibl n="Plat. Euthyd. 288E"><title>Euthyd.</title> 288 E</bibl> ff.&mdash;<foreign lang="greek">ὁ χρώμενος</foreign> has, not indeed scientific knowledge of the Idea,
            but something analogous thereto. Dialectic, which is the scientific Knowledge of Ideas,
            is <foreign lang="greek">κατ’ ἐξοχήν</foreign> the <foreign lang="greek">χρωμένη
              ἐπιστήμη</foreign>, the Science which alone knows in what respect each thing is good
            and <hi rend="italic">useful</hi>, and <hi rend="italic">uses</hi> things accordingly
            (cf. <bibl n="Plat. Euthyd. 290C"><title>Euthyd.</title> 290 C</bibl>, <bibl n="Plat. Crat. 390C"><title>Crat.</title> 390 C</bibl>), proving itself thereby the
            royal or kingly science (VI 505 A note). Thus the man who uses a single instrument
            correctly occupies the same relative position in regard to that object which the
            dialectician occupies in regard to the totality of things, and is, in his own small way,
            a king compared with the maker and imitator of the instrument. Cf. Bosanquet p. 390. But
            if Plato had intended us to pursue this vein, he would, I think, have furnished us with
            some hints in the course of the argument itself. See also on 601 B.</p>
          <p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">οἷα -- χρῆται</lemma>: &lsquo;what are the

            cannot like the Greeks say &lsquo;makes&rsquo;&mdash; &lsquo;in
            use.&rsquo; This interpretation, which is Schleiermacher's (&ldquo;wie sich das
            was er gebraucht gut oder schlecht zeigt in Gebrauch&rdquo;), seems to me the
            natural and obvious meaning of the Greek. In agreement, apparently, with Schneider's
            version, Campbell proposes &ldquo;what specimens of that which he (the user)
            employs, the maker makes that are good or bad in actual use,&rdquo; remarking that
            &ldquo;the correlation of singular and plural arises from the collocation of
            particular and universal. The instrument (sing.) is <hi rend="italic">good in some
              cases, but bad in others</hi> (plur.).&rdquo; Campbell's solution has the
            advantage of referring <foreign lang="greek">ποιεῖ</foreign> to <foreign lang="greek">ποιητής</foreign>, and corresponds more exactly with <foreign lang="greek">χρηστῶν
              καὶ πονήρῶν αὐλῶν</foreign> in E. The grammatical difficulty is however, I think,
            insuperable. If the subject to <foreign lang="greek">ποιεῖ</foreign> must be <foreign lang="greek">ποιητής</foreign>, it would even be easier to make <foreign lang="greek">ᾧ χρῆται</foreign>=<foreign lang="greek">τούτῳ ὃς
            χρῆται</foreign>&mdash;a rare form of attraction illustrated on V 465 D: but there
            is a certain elegance in applying <foreign lang="greek">ποιεῖ</foreign> also to the
            instrument, which is in its way a &lsquo;maker too&rsquo; and one by whose

              <foreign lang="greek">ἐξαγγέλλει</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">ἐπιτάξει</foreign> seem easy and natural. To the ordinary interpretation, which makes
              <foreign lang="greek">αὐλῶν</foreign> the antecedent to <foreign lang="greek">οἳ
              ἄν</foreign>, it is a serious and I think fatal objection that the verb <foreign lang="greek">ὑπηρετεῖν</foreign> is used immediately afterwards of the flutemaker in
            a way which seems to imply that it has been used of him before: and it is also very
            strange and unnatural to speak of flutes as <foreign lang="greek">ὑπηρέται ἐν τῷ
              αὐλεῖν</foreign>. Jowett's translation &ldquo;which of his flutes is <hi rend="italic">satisfactory to</hi> the performer,&rdquo; though Schleiermacher,
            Schneider and Prantl take much the same view, cannot be fairly extracted from <foreign lang="greek">οἳ ἂν ὑπηρετῶσιν</foreign>. Many inferior MSS read <foreign lang="greek">οἷα</foreign> for <foreign lang="greek">οἵ</foreign>: and Richards
            conjectures <foreign lang="greek">οἷα ποιοῦσιν</foreign> or <foreign lang="greek">οἷα ἀποτελοῦσιν</foreign>, but the change is much too great. I once suggested

          <p>602C - 603B Consider, again, what is the part of our nature to which Imitation appeals.
            Painting depends for its effect on the optical delusions to which we are subject, and
            against which the arts of measurement, counting etc., are our only safeguard. The
            rational part of soul applies these arts, and proves itself the best by accepting their
            results. The opposing part is therefore one of the baser elements within us; and base
            will be the brood that springs from its union with imitative art, in Poetry as well as
            Painting.</p>
          <p>ff. The reasoning from here to 607 A has been supposed to rest on a psychological
            theory irreconcileable with that of Book IV, to which the discussion expressly alludes
            (in 602 E). See for example Krohn <title>Pl. St.</title> p. 255 and Pfleiderer <hi rend="italic">Zur L&ouml;sung</hi> etc., p. 38. It is true that Plato is here
            content, in view of his immediate purpose, with a twofold division of soul into (1) a
            rational and (2) an irrational, <foreign lang="greek">ἀλόγιστον</foreign> (604 D, 605
            B), or lower element. But the resemblance between the two theories is greater than the
            difference, for a the <foreign lang="greek">λογιστικόν</foreign> is common to both, and
            b on its moral side the irrational element appears sometimes as the <foreign lang="greek">ἐπιθυμητικόν</foreign> (606 D <foreign lang="greek">καὶ περὶ
              ἀφροδισίων  καὶ περὶ πάντων τῶν ἐπιθυμητικῶν κτλ.</foreign>),
            sometimes as a degenerate form of the <foreign lang="greek">θυμοειδές</foreign> (604 E,
            606 A : cf. <foreign lang="greek">θυμοῦ</foreign> 606 D). What is new is the assignment
            to the <foreign lang="greek">ἀλόγιστον</foreign> of a certain quasi-intellectual
            power&mdash;viz. the power of forming false <hi rend="italic">opinions</hi> (603 A,
            605 C); but there was no occasion to raise this point in the earlier psychology, which
            was intended as a foundation for Plato's theory of the virtues. It becomes necessary to
            touch upon the question now, because imitative art aims at producing false opinions, and
            Plato accordingly assigns them to the <foreign lang="greek">ἀλόγιστον</foreign>.</p>
          <p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">πρὸς Διὸς κτλ.</lemma> The logical sequence is
            &ldquo;iam vero haec imitatio non solum futilia efficit, sed etiam futilem animi

            the transitional sentence interrogative in form, but the extreme animation carries it
            through. We cannot (with Stephanus) cancel <foreign lang="greek">οὐ</foreign> and print

            some given objects are greater or less than or equal to some others, the contrary

            example, which is nearer and smaller, appears larger than B: but the <foreign lang="greek">λογιστικόν</foreign> discovers after measurement that A is smaller and
            reports accordingly. We have thus two contrary coexisting impressions of the same
            object. One of the two impressions belongs to the <foreign lang="greek">λογιστικόν</foreign>: does the other also? No, because, as shewn in IV 436
            A&mdash;C, it is impossible for the same faculty to hold contrary opinions
            simultaneously in relation to the same objects. Hence the part of soul which <foreign lang="greek">δοξάζει παρὰ τὰ μέτρα</foreign> is not the same as that which
              <foreign lang="greek">δοξάζει κατὰ τὰ μέτρα</foreign> (i.e. the <foreign lang="greek">λογιστικόν</foreign>). And as the part which believes <foreign lang="greek">λογισμός</foreign> (viz. the <foreign lang="greek">λογιστικόν</foreign>, cf. 604 D, 605 B) is the best, that which opposes it will be
              <foreign lang="greek">τῶν φαύλων τι ἐν ἡμῖν</foreign>. J. and C. follow Schneider
            in translating <foreign lang="greek">τῷ αὐτῷ</foreign> as instrumental
            (&lsquo;with the same faculty to form opposite opinions at the same

            after <foreign lang="greek">ἀδύνατον</foreign>, in view especially of <foreign lang="greek">τὸδοξάζον τῆς ψυχῆς</foreign> immediately following.

          <p>603B - 605C If we examine Poetry on its own merits, apart from the sisterart of
            Painting, we observe that Poetry imitates action. Now in action we often fluctuate
            between two impulses. When a great calamity befalls us, we are tempted to give way to
            grief, before the eyes of others; but Law bids us refrain, and try to cure the wound
            instead of hugging it. That which is best within us readily obeys: whereas the part that
            tempts us to dwell upon our sorrows is irrational, indolent, cowardly. Yet it is just
            this peevish, querulous side of human nature which most lends itself to imitation, and
            whose portrayal in dramatic art the vulgar most readily understand. Poetry is thus the
            counterpart of Painting; its products are low in point of truth, and it feeds our lower
            nature. We exclude the Poet from our city on both grounds.</p>

              <foreign lang="greek">εἰδωλοποιοῦντα</foreign> seems also to have been the reading
            of the first hand in Vind. F. The dative <foreign lang="greek">εἰδωλοποιοῦντι</foreign> is retained by Schneider, who makes it agree with <foreign lang="greek">τῷ ἀνοήτῳ</foreign> and regards <foreign lang="greek">ἀφεστῶτα</foreign> as neuter plural. This interpretation, though grammatically
            tenable, is otherwise unsatisfactory. Plato (in 605 A) has just correlated Poetry with
            Painting because Poetry also a produces <foreign lang="greek">φαῦλα πρὸς
            ἀλήθειαν</foreign> and b consorts with <foreign lang="greek">φαῦλόν τι τῆς
            ψυχῆς</foreign>. On both grounds, he concludes, Poetry must be proscribed: for b
              <foreign lang="greek">τοῦτο ἐγείρειτοτὲ δὲ σμικρά</foreign>, and a
              <foreign lang="greek">εἴδωλα εἰδωλοποιεῖ</foreign>. The chiastic sequence is usual
            in Plato. If we read <foreign lang="greek">εἰδωλοποιοῦντι</foreign>, Plato assigns
            only <hi rend="italic">one</hi> of his two main reasons for the exclusion of Poetry,
            viz. b, and the correspondence between this and the preceding sentence disappears. On
            this account Stallbaum and others are, I believe, right in restoring the accusative, and
            making <foreign lang="greek">ἀφεστῶτα</foreign>, as well as <foreign lang="greek">εἰδωλοποιοῦντα</foreign>, agree with <foreign lang="greek">τὸν μιμητικὸν
            ποιητήν</foreign>. The error&mdash;an easy one after <foreign lang="greek">διαγιγνώσκοντι</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">ἡγουμένῳ</foreign> &mdash;
            affected <foreign lang="greek">ἀφεστῶτα</foreign> also in at least one MS, for
              <foreign lang="greek">Ξ</foreign> has <foreign lang="greek">ἀφεστῶτι</foreign>.</p>
          <p>605C - 607A But the most serious count in our indictment is that Poetry is capable of
            corrupting, with few exceptions, even men of character and virtue. Tragedy stirs in us
            just those emotions which we are ashamed to indulge when suffering misfortunes of our
            own, and the consequence is that we succumb more readily in the hour of trial. The same
            may be said, mutatis mutandis, of comedy also. We shall therefore decline to model our
            lives after Homer, and refuse to surrender our city to the rule of Pleasure.</p>

          <p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">θρέψαντα -- κατέχειν</lemma>. Plato and Aristotle
            agree in holding that Pity is one of the principal emotions to which Tragedy ministers.
            The point at which they part company is where they begin to discuss the effect produced
            upon human life and conduct by the indulgence of this emotion in the mimicry of the
            stage. According to Plato, the emotion grows by what it feeds upon, and becomes more and
            more troublesome and deleterious in real life, the more we indulge it at the theatre:
            according to Aristotle, tragedy effects the &lsquo;purgation&rsquo; of pity and
            its kindred emotions and tends to free us from their dominion in matters of more serious
            moment (<title>Poet.</title> 6. 1449^{b} 27 et al.). Aristotle hopes to effect by means
            of theatrical stimulation what Plato would attain by starving the emotions even in play.
            It is obvious that the Aristotelian theory of the drama was in this important respect
            developed in direct and conscious antagonism to the Platonic, to which, in other
            particulars, it owes much: see Finsler <title>Platon u. die Arist. Poetik</title> pp. 96
            ff. I think it may fairly be argued that Plato's view is not less true to experience
            than that of Aristotle; for a spectacle which &lsquo;purges&rsquo; the <foreign lang="greek">ἐλεεινόν</foreign> in one man may strengthen it in another and make him
            more than ever inclined to self-pity. On the contrast between the Platonic and

            theological and moral grounds: see for example Heraclitus <title>Fr.</title> 35, 43,

            readily have described philosophers by this feature, because the head, and not the heart
            or midriff, was believed to be the seat of intelligence not only by Hippocrates, but
            also by many of the philosophers themselves, including Pythagoras, Alcmaeo, Democritus

            seriously, in spite of Plato's immoveable conviction of the immortality of the soul (see
            on VI 498 D). The doctrine itself had of course long been an article of the Orphic and
            Pythagorean creeds (see Rohde <title>Psyche</title>^{2} II pp. 1 ff. and Laudowicz <hi rend="italic">Pr&auml;existenz d. Seele u. Seelenwand. in Gr. Phil.</hi> pp.
            1&mdash;29), and we must not suppose (with Thomas Gray) that it is the novelty of
            the idea which occasions Glauco's wonder. Glauco regards the originally half-theological
            doctrine of the immortality of the Soul with the same sort of well-bred incredulity
            which it inspired in most of Plato's contemporaries (cf. VI 498 D with I 330 D, E and
              <bibl n="Plat. Phaedo 69E"><title>Phaed.</title> 69 E</bibl>, 70 A, 80 D), and is
            astonished that a well-balanced mind should treat it seriously as a philosophical dogma
            capable of being established by rational argument.</p>
          <p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">εἰ μὴ ἀδικῶ γε</lemma>. See on IV 430 D.</p>
          <p>608D - 611A Everything, which suffers destruction, is destroyed by its own peculiar
            evil or disease, and that which cannot be destroyed thereby is indestructible. Now the
            evil which is peculiar to the soul is vice, and vice is powerless to slay the soul. We
            must beware of supposing that the soul is destroyed by bodily disease, unless it can be
            proved that bodily disease engenders within the soul its own specific evil; and if any
            one has the boldness to assert that the souls of the dying do actually become more
            vicious, he must be prepared to shew that vice, alone and by itself, is fatal to its
            possessor, which is far from being true. Vice would lose its terrors if death were the
            end of all things. We conclude that the soul is immortal, since neither its own nor any
            alien evil can destroy it.</p>
          <p>ff. Socrates has already expressed his belief in the immortality of the soul in VI 498
            D: cf. also ib. 496 E and I 330 D, E. The proof which Plato gives here has been widely
            discussed and severely, though often unfairly and unintelligently, criticised by many
            critics, to some of whom reference is made in the <pb n="422"/> course of the notes.
            Plato does not stop to define what he means by &lsquo;soul,&rsquo; nor the
            different senses in which he employs the word &lsquo;death,&rsquo; and the
            consequence is that superficial inspection of his reasoning often sees a fallacy where
            there is only an ellipse. The best preparation for a study of this argument is a careful
            examination of the proofs in the <title>Phaedo</title>, to which Plato himself appears
            expressly to allude in 611 B: see note ad loc. It will be easier to understand the
            reasoning of Plato if we bear in mind the following considerations. (1) The duality of
            soul and body is assumed throughout the whole discussion. (2) It is the individual
            immortality of the soul which Plato wishes to prove. (In his excellent monograph <hi rend="italic">Unsterblichkeitslehre Plato's</hi>, Halle, 1878, Bertram appears to me
            to have conclusively and once for all established this point as against
            Teichm&uuml;ller <title>Die Plat. Fr.</title> pp. 1&mdash;23. Cf. Simson
              <title>Der Begriff d. Seele bei Plato</title> pp. 126&mdash;143). (3) The
            conception of soul as the principle of life, though not expressly enunciated here, is
            present to Plato's mind (609 D note). The question whether immortality (in the fullest
            sense of the term) belongs to the entire soul, or only to part of it, is not raised in
            the course of the proof itself, but from 611 B&mdash;612 A, it would seem that the
              <foreign lang="greek">λογιστικόν</foreign> alone is indestructible (611 B note). At
            each successive incarnation the <foreign lang="greek">λογιστικόν</foreign> is defiled
              <foreign lang="greek">ὑπὸ τῆς τοῦ σώματος κοινωνίας</foreign>, and (according to
              <bibl n="Plat. Phaedo 81B"><title>Phaed.</title> 81 B</bibl> ff.) the pollution
            frequently adheres even after death, causing the soul to seek re-incarnation. The
            ultimate aim is apparently to be delivered from bodily existence altogether, and live
              <foreign lang="greek">ἄνευ σωμάτων τὸ παράπαν εἰς τὸν ἔπειτα
            χρόνον</foreign> (<bibl n="Plat. Phaedo 114C"><title>Phaed.</title> 114 C</bibl>), but
            even then the soul would not&mdash;so at least I think&mdash;seem to Plato to
            lose its essential individuality and become absorbed. See on the whole subject Simson

            dissolution of a the body (as described in C above <foreign lang="greek">ὥσπερ σῶμα
               εἰς τὸ μηδὲ σῶμα εἶναι</foreign>), b the soul, c the <foreign lang="greek">σύνολον</foreign>, or body <hi rend="italic">plus</hi> soul. If the soul
            is mortal, the moment at which it is dissolved and perishes is when the <foreign lang="greek">σύνολον</foreign> dies, i.e. (<bibl n="Plat.

            Plato reminds us of this by saying <foreign lang="greek">ἕως ἂν εἰς θάνατον

            Glauco should assent so readily. He is apparently thinking (as in 610 E) of the activity
            and vitality which wicked men so frequently display; but we may fairly ask
            &lsquo;Why should soul be the only thing which is incapable of being destroyed by
            its own vice?&rsquo; It would surely be more true to hold that vice is able to kill

              αὐτὴν κακήν</foreign> (609 B), and Panaetius actually made use of a similar
            argument in order to prove the soul mortal (&ldquo;nihil esse, quod doleat, quin id
            aegrum esse quoque possit. quod autem in morbum cadat, id etiam interiturum; dolere
            autem animos, ergo etiam interire&rdquo; Cicero <title>Tusc. Disp.</title> I 79). Is

            appeal to experience? Even if we allowed that experience is the proper tribunal, our
            experience of the effect of injustice on a human soul is limited to a single life; and
            why should not one soul wear out many bodies and perish at last through its own vice
              <foreign lang="greek">καὶ ᾖ αὐτὸ τοῦτο θάνατος, ψυχῆς ὄλεθρος</foreign>
            (cf. <bibl n="Plat. Phaedo 87B"><title>Phaed.</title> 87 B</bibl>, 91 D. See also
            Deichert <hi rend="italic">Plato's Beweise f. die Unsterblichkeit d. Seele</hi> pp.
            46&mdash;48). These difficulties are serious, and possibly fatal: they have even led
            some critics to stigmatise the whole argument as a <hi rend="italic">petitio
            principii</hi> (e.g. Brandt <title>Zur Entwick. d. Pl. Lehre v. d. Seelentheilen</title>
            p. 29). Plato does not attempt to solve them here; but <pb n="424"/> a comparison of the
            present argument with <bibl n="Plat. Phaedo 93A"><title>Phaed.</title> 93
            A</bibl>&mdash;94 B helps at all events to explain his position. Soul is always
            soul, and no soul is more a soul than any other (<bibl n="Plat. Phaedo 93B"><title>Phaed.</title> 93 B</bibl>); hence the soul which is made evil by vice
            retains its vitality unimpaired. It is in fact the conception of soul as the principle
            of life which explains (from the Platonic point of view) Glauco's emphatic <foreign lang="greek">οὐδαμῶς</foreign>. Cf. I 353 D <foreign lang="greek">τί δ̓ αὖ τὸ
              ζῆν; ψυχῆς φήσομεν ἔργον εἶναι; Μάλιστά γ̓, ἔφη</foreign>, with note ad
            loc. It is on the essential connexion between &lsquo;soul&rsquo; and
            &lsquo;life&rsquo; that Plato builds his crowning argument for the immortality
            of the soul in the <title>Phaedo</title> (100 B ff., and especially 105 C, D). Cf.

            may not be conclusive (609 D note); but we are surely not justified in charging Plato

            passages contains the germ of a new argument for immortality. It might be urged that a
            future existence is necessary in order that the wicked may pay the penalty for their
            sins, so that Immortality would become a &ldquo;postulate of the moral government of
            the universe&rdquo; (Deichert l.c. p. 48). Plato <pb n="426"/> is content merely to
            suggest this argument: neither here nor elsewhere does he place it in the forefront of
            his dialectical proof of immo&lt;*&gt;ality.</p>

            reminds us of it here because the theory of future rewards and punishments, which he

            D. and V., with whom Jowett and apparently also Schneider agree. Prantl and others take
            the right view). Now that he has proved the soul to be immortal, Plato takes the
            opportunity to suggest a revision of the psychology of Book IV, in which soul was
            treated as composite (435 A note): for nothing that is composite can well be immortal
            (cf. <title>Phaed.</title> l.c.). According to the theory which is rather suggested (612
            A) than fully worked out in this chapter, the socalled lower &lsquo;parts&rsquo;
            are not of the essence of soul at all, but only incidental to its association with body,
            and consequently perishable. Cf. <bibl n="Plat. Phaedo 66C"><title>Phaed.</title> 66

            nature is <foreign lang="greek">λογιστικόν</foreign>, and that the <foreign lang="greek">λογιστικόν</foreign> alone is immortal (so also Simson <title>Begriff d.

            where Plato is thinking of Orphic and Pythagorean beliefs, and suggests that <foreign lang="greek">οἱ ἄλλοι</foreign> should here be interpreted in the same way; while
            Pfleiderer (<hi rend="italic">Zur L&ouml;sung</hi> etc. p. 41) sees an allusion to

            other grounds, and also on account of the remarkable affinity between that dialogue and

          <p>612A - 613E Now that we have proved Justice to be in itself, apart from all
            consequences, best for the soul, we may safely dwell on the rewards of Virtue both in
            life and after death. We revoke the concession which, for the sake of the argument, we
            formerly made, and restore to Justice the appreciation which in point of fact she does
            receive from gods and men. The just are dear to the gods and the special object of their
            providence, but it is otherwise with the unjust. Among men too, Injustice, though for a
            time it may run well, breaks down before the race is finished; whereas Justice reaches
            the goal and wins the crown. The honours and prizes which Glauco claimed for successful
            Injustice fall to Justice, and it is the unjust who suffer the insults and torments
            which he foretold for the just.</p>

            Jackson is inclined&mdash; perhaps rightly&mdash;to make the sentence categoric
            and not interrogative. In <foreign lang="greek">τὰ ἄλλα ἀπελυσάμεθα</foreign> the
            word <foreign lang="greek">ἄλλα</foreign> refers to the other points raised by
            Thrasymachus (I 337 A ff.), Glauco and Adimantus (II 358 E ff.), besides the complaint
            that Justice is usually recommended not on its own merits, but for the sake of its
            results (II 362 E ff.). For <foreign lang="greek">ἀπελυσάμεθα</foreign> cf. VI 499 E

              <foreign lang="greek">ἐπηνέγκαμεν</foreign>, I formerly read (with Cobet, Baiter and
            J. and C.) <foreign lang="greek">ἐπῃνέκαμεν</foreign>. The scribe of Paris A (see cr.
            n.) seems to have had both readings before him, but to have finally decided in favour of
              <foreign lang="greek">ἐπῃνέκαμεν</foreign>, which is in exact correspondence with

            367 D. All the other MSS read <foreign lang="greek">ἐπηνέγκαμεν</foreign> except Par.
            K, which has <foreign lang="greek">ἐπηνέσαμεν. ἐπηνέγκαμεν</foreign> should probably
            be preferred, both on account of the MS evidence, and still more because the aorist
            seems necessary to balance <foreign lang="greek">ἀπελυσάμεθα</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">ηὕρομεν</foreign>. There is no special reason why the <hi rend="italic">word</hi>

            lower&rdquo; etc. (J. and C.). Plato is thinking of the <foreign lang="greek">δίαυλος</foreign>, and calls the outward and homeward journeys respectively <foreign lang="greek">ἀπὸ τῶν κάτω</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">ἀπὸ τῶν
            ἄνω</foreign>. We must suppose, although there seems to be no other authority for the
            supposition, that the end from which the competitors started was spoken of as
            &lsquo;down&rsquo; and the other end as &lsquo;up.&rsquo; Schneider
            suggests that the outward limit may have stood higher, but Greek stadia seem always to
              <pb n="432"/> have been level. The use of <foreign lang="greek">ἄνω</foreign> and
              <foreign lang="greek">κάτω</foreign> is as in <foreign lang="greek">περιπατεῖν ἄνω
              κάτω</foreign> (<bibl n="Aristoph. Lys. 709">Ar. <title>Lys.</title> 709</bibl>), <foreign lang="greek">εἷρπ’ ἄνω τε καὶ κάτω</foreign> (<bibl n="Eur. Her. 953">Eur.

              <title>Thes.</title> s.v. <foreign lang="greek">ἄνω</foreign> p. 1063. The subject
            of <foreign lang="greek">ἀποπηδῶσι</foreign> is not <foreign lang="greek">οἱ
            δρομῆς</foreign>, but <foreign lang="greek">οἱ δεινοί τε καὶ ἄδικοι</foreign>: so
            that <foreign lang="greek">τὸ μὲν πρῶτον</foreign> corresponds roughly to <foreign lang="greek">ἀπὸ τῶν κάτω</foreign>, and <foreign lang="greek">τελευτῶντες</foreign> to <foreign lang="greek">ἀπὸ τῶν ἄνω</foreign>. This
            interpretation is that of Schneider and the other editors. A wholly different view is
            taken by Riddell (<title>Digest</title> &sect; 111) and Madvig. They understand
              <foreign lang="greek">τὰ κάτω</foreign> of the lower, and <foreign lang="greek">τὰ
              ἄνω</foreign> of the upper parts of the body (&ldquo;who run fairly with their
            legs, but with the upper part of their bodies&mdash;head, neck, arms&mdash;in
            bad form&rdquo; Riddell l.c. For the use of <foreign lang="greek">ἀπό</foreign>
            cf. <title>Laws</title> 795 B, 832 E and Xen. <title>Rep. Lac.</title> 5. 9). But an
            allusion to the physiology of bad running is not in place here, and it is difficult to
            resist the impression that <foreign lang="greek">ἀπὸ τῶν κάτω</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">ἀπὸ τῶν ἄνω</foreign> are significant parts of the comparison. On
            Riddell's view they are not, for there is nothing in the career of the clever and unjust
            which can well be illustrated by &lsquo;running fairly with their legs&rsquo;
            etc. The point is, as <foreign lang="greek">τὸ μὲν
            πρῶτονἀποτρέχοντες</foreign> expressly states, that they do well at first,
            but collapse before the end, like runners who run well as far as the <foreign lang="greek">καμπτήρ</foreign>, but break down in the second half of the <foreign lang="greek">δίαυλος</foreign>. For the illustration from the games cf. V 465 D

            heard the narrative of their experiences from other souls that had fulfilled the
            millennial period of reward or punishment. In most cases the recompense for good and
            evil actions was tenfold; but certain crimes were punished yet more sternly, and for

            l.c. pp. 128 ff.: cf. also Norden l.c. p. 374, Rohde <title>Psyche</title>^{2} II pp. 91
            ff., and Zeller^{5} I 1. p. 450. Dieterich may be wrong in some of his conjectures, as
            F. Weber tries to shew in his inaugural dissertation, <hi rend="italic">Platonische
              Notizen &uuml;ber Orpheus</hi> M&uuml;nchen 1899 p. 20 note, but the broad
            outlines of his theory are in my opinion established beyond reasonable doubt). Evidence
            of Pythagorean and Orphic affinities will be cited in the notes. Cf. Proclus <hi rend="italic">in remp.</hi> II p. 110 Kroll <foreign lang="greek">εἴτε δὲ ἔχει

            freely with his materials, and the myth of the <pb n="434"/>

            therefore probable that Plato borrowed the meadow from some Orphic or Pythagorean dogma.
            We ought, I think, to conceive the meadow as situated somewhere on what Plato in the

            meaning the real surface of the earth as opposed to the misty hollows in which we live:

It is unwise to insert <foreign lang="greek">ἀποθανόντων</foreign> (Ast, Stallbaum) or <foreign lang="greek">ἀπογενομένων</foreign> (Herwerden, Baiter) after <foreign lang="greek">γενομένων</foreign>, or to read <foreign lang="greek">&lt;ἀπο&gt;γενομένων</foreign> (Cobet), for, as Schneider observes,

            whether <foreign lang="greek">εὐθύς</foreign> can have this meaning: and it is safer,
            I think, to understand <foreign lang="greek">εὐθὺς γενόμενοι</foreign> in the

            in their order. On each of the eight whorls is perched a Siren, uttering a single note,
            the eight notes thus produced result- <pb n="441"/> ing in a single
            &lsquo;harmony&rsquo; or mode. Meanwhile the three Fates, as they assist in the
            revolutions, keep singing to the Sirens' music, Lachesis hymning the past, Clotho the
            present, and Atropos the future.</p>
          <p>ff. The astronomical difficulties in this part of the <title>Republic</title> have
            occasioned a great deal of controversy and discussion. Besides the various editions and
            translations of the <title>Republic</title> in English and German, and the commentaries
            of Proclus and Theo, the writers whom I have chiefly studied are Grote (<hi rend="italic">Plato on the Earth's Rotation</hi>), Boeckh (<title>Kleine
            Schriften</title> III pp. 266&mdash;320), Donaldson (<title>Transactions of the
              Cambridge Philosophical Society</title>, X pp. 305&mdash;316), Susemihl

            pp. 278&mdash;289) and Zeller^{5} I pp. 434 f. notes Donaldson's article, to which
            Dr Jackson first called my attention, although it lacks consistency and clearness, and
            passes over many difficulties, contains the germ of what I now believe to be the correct
            theory of the straight light. But nothing that has hitherto been published on the
            subject supplies at once a full and satisfactory explanation of the difficulties, and it
            is only through the kind cooperation of Professor Cook Wilson that I have at last been
            able to form a definite view as to the meaning and solution of this extremely
            complicated problem. From 616 B to the middle of 617 B my commentary is mainly based on
            the exhaustive criticisms and investigations which he has sent to me.</p>
          <p>The general scope and purpose of the astronomical part of the myth would seem to be to
            set before the souls a picture of the &lsquo;harmonies and revolutions of the
            Universe&rsquo; in conformity with which it is their highest duty and privilege to
            live. Cf. <bibl n="Plat. Tim. 90C"><title>Tim.</title> 90 C</bibl>, D <foreign lang="greek">τῷ δ’ ἐν ἡμῖν θείῳ ξυγγενεῖς εἰσι κινήσεις αἱ τοῦ παντὸς
              διανοήσεις καὶ περιφοραί· ταύταις δὴ ξυνεπόμενον ἕκαστον δεῖ τὰς περὶ τὴν
              γένεσιν ἐν τῇ κεφαλῇ διεφθαρμένας ἡμῶν περιόδους ἐξορθοῦντα διὰ τὸ
              καταμανθάνειν τὰς τοῦ παντὸς ἁρμονίας τε καὶ περιφορὰς τῷ κατανοουμένῳ τὸ
              κατανοοῦν ἐξομοιῶσαι κατὰ τὴν ἀρχαίαν φύσιν, ὁμοιώσαντα δὲ τέλος ἔχειν
              τοῦ προτεθέντος ἀνθρώποις ὑπὸ θεῶν ἀρίστου βίου πρός τε τὸν παρόντα καὶ
              τὸν ἔπειτα χρόνον</foreign>. It will facilitate the study of the details if we
            observe in advance that Plato's description falls into two well-marked divisions or
            sections, viz. from <foreign lang="greek">ἀφικνεῖσθαι τεταρταίους</foreign> down to
              <foreign lang="greek">τὴν περιφοράν</foreign> (616 B, C), and from <foreign lang="greek">ἐκ δὲ τῶν ἄκρων</foreign> (616 C) to the end of the myth. In the
            first section we have a representation of the outermost or sidereal sphere, girdled by a
            circle of light, which is prolonged through the poles into a column or shaft of light
            spanning the Universe from pole to pole and symbolizing to all appearances the cosmical
            axis. See on line 14 below. In the second section the scene is shifted, and we are
            introduced to a new picture of the celestial system, including the fixed stars, but
            without the encompassing girdle of light, assimilated to the poetical and suggestive
            figure of Necessity and her spindle, the shaft of which again represents the axis of the
            Universe. The details are fully discussed in the notes, where it is shewn that the two
            parts of the description cannot from their very nature be combined into a coherent and
            consistent whole, and that in consequence of their essential inconsistency Plato's
            passing attempt to reconcile them inevitably fails. See on <foreign lang="greek">ἐκ δὲ
              τῶν ἄκρων κτλ.</foreign> 616 C and App. VI.</p>
          <p>If the question is asked, &lsquo;Does Plato's description embody a serious
            astronomical theory of the visible heaven and its machinery?&rsquo; what answer
            should be returned? The following remarks will indicate the kind of reply which seems to
            be in harmony both with Plato's general attitude on astronomical questions and with the
            special peculiarities of the myth before us. (1) The visible heavens, according to the
              <title>Republic</title>, are not the object of true Astronomy. The true Astronomer is
            concerned with <foreign lang="greek">ἃς τὸ ὂν τάχος καὶ ἡ οὖσα βραδυτὴς ἐν
              τῷ ἀληθινῷ ἀριθμῷ καὶ πᾶσι τοῖς ἀληθέσι σχήμασι φοράς τε πρὸς ἄλληλα
              φέρεται καὶ τὰ ἐνόντα φέρει</foreign> (VII 529 D. See note ad loc.). We may
            therefore expect imagination and idealism to play a large part in Plato's astronomical
            pictures, more especially when they form part of a myth. (2) The greater portion of this
            passage is in reality a similitude representing the celestial system under the figure of
            the spindle of Necessity. <pb n="442"/> Now it is clear that Plato deliberately
            sacrificed the reality of the sidereal sphere when he found it inconsistent with the
            figure which he had chosen (see on <foreign lang="greek">κύκλους κτλ.</foreign> 616 D).
            And if he could concede so much to his comparison, the question arises, &lsquo;Are
            we justified in regarding <hi rend="italic">any</hi> of the machinery as seriously
            expressing Plato's real conception of the mechanism of the heavens?&rsquo; It will
            be found on reflection that the only satisfactory and safe reply is that all the
            machinery, including the material whorls and axis of the spindle, is poetical
            throughout. This does not of course exclude the supposition that some of the details of
            Plato's imagery are borrowed from earlier astronomical fancies, and it is highly
            probable that here, as elsewhere in the myth, he takes something from the Pythagoreans:
            see on 616 C, D, 617 B. (3) The entire description should in all probability be regarded
            as &ldquo;essentially a symbolic representation and not an attempt at scientific
            explanation&rdquo; (Cook Wilson). But &lsquo;a symbolic representation should
            stand in some relation to the thing signified,&rsquo; and in this case all we can
            reasonably infer from Plato's symbolism is that, according to his belief, the Earth is
            in the middle: the Sun, Moon and Planets revolve round the Earth at different distances
            from the centre and with different velocities, participating in the general movement of
            the heavens and at the same time having a contrary movement of their own. As for the
            fixed stars, it would seem from the first part of Plato's description that he supposed
            them to be fixed in the outermost sphere of the Universe, round which he plainly
            supposes that the circle of the Milky Way extends. See also on 616 C, 617 A.</p>
          <p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">καὶ ἀφικνεῖσθαι κτλ.</lemma> &lsquo;And on the
            fourth day they arrived at a point from which they descried extending from above through
            all the heaven and earth a straight light, like a pillar, resembling the rainbow more
            than anything else, but brighter and purer.&rsquo; The souls see the light for the
            first time on the fourth day after they begin their march, and consequently on the
            eleventh day from Er's arrival at the meadow. The remaining incidents occupy one day,
            and it is on the twelfth that Er revives (<foreign lang="greek">δωδεκαταῖος
              ἀνεβίω</foreign> 614 B). See on <foreign lang="greek">ἕωθεν</foreign> in 621 B. As
            far as the Greek is concerned, <foreign lang="greek">ἄνωθεν</foreign> may be construed
            either with <foreign lang="greek">καθορᾶν</foreign> or with <foreign lang="greek">τεταμένον</foreign>. In the former case, we should probably have to suppose (with
            Boeckh l.c. p. 299) that Er's point of view is outside the Universe; but it will be
            shewn in Appendix VI that there are serious difficulties in the way of this supposition,
            and the second alternative is to be preferred. It has already been remarked that Plato
            in all probability thinks of the <foreign lang="greek">λειμών</foreign> as somewhere on
            the true surface of the Earth described by him in the myth of the <title>Phaedo</title>
            (614 C note), and it is apparently along this surface that the souls progress until they
            come in view of the light. As regards the shape and position of the light, Plato's
            language is clear and precise. The light is &lsquo;straight, like a
            pillar,&rsquo; and &lsquo;stretched through all the heaven and earth.&rsquo;
            The only natural interpretation of these words is that a column or shaft of light spans
            the entire Universe, like the diameter of a circle, and passes through the centre of the
            Earth, which, according to Plato, is situated in the middle of the whole (<bibl n="Plat. Phaedo 108E"><title>Phaed.</title> 108 E</bibl> ff., <bibl n="Plat. Tim. 40B"><title>Tim.</title> 40 B</bibl>). With <foreign lang="greek">διὰ
              παντὸστεταμένον</foreign> we may compare <bibl n="Plat. Tim. 40B"><title>Tim.</title> 40 B</bibl>
            <foreign lang="greek">τὸν διὰ παντὸς πόλον τεταμένον</foreign> (of the axis of the
            Universe). The words <foreign lang="greek">μάλιστα τῇ ἴριδι προσφερές</foreign>
            refer, not of course to the shape, but to the colour of the light, as appears from
              <foreign lang="greek">λαμπρότερον δὲ καὶ καθαρώτερον</foreign>. The correction of
              <foreign lang="greek">προσφερῆ</foreign> to <foreign lang="greek">προσφερές</foreign> in A (see cr. n.) is late, but <foreign lang="greek">προσφερές</foreign> is intrinsically a better reading, and might easily have been
            altered to <foreign lang="greek">προσφερῆ</foreign> under the influence of <foreign lang="greek">κίονα</foreign>. In defence of <foreign lang="greek">προσφερῆ</foreign>
            Schneider cites <foreign lang="greek">ἀπωχετευμένον</foreign> in VI 485 D, but the two
            cases are not exactly parallel: see note ad loc. Other views on this passage are
            discussed in App. VI.</p>
          <p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">εἰς ὃ ἀφικέσθαι κτλ.</lemma> &lsquo;At this
            light they arrived after a day's march forward, and there, at the middle of the
            light&rsquo; etc. <pb n="445"/> Instead of <foreign lang="greek">προελθόντας</foreign>, A and other MSS have <foreign lang="greek">προελθόντες</foreign> (see cr. n.), which Schneider defends by saying that the
            nominative refers not to all the party, but only to Er and his immediate companions. But
            even in that case the accusative would be more correct, and in point of fact it is clear
            from what follows that Er is accompanied throughout by <hi rend="italic">all</hi> the
            souls about to be born again. A few other MSS besides <hi rend="italic">q</hi> have the
            accusative. If the light is &lsquo;straight, like a pillar,&rsquo; and stretches
            &lsquo;through all the heaven and earth,&rsquo; it follows that as the Earth is
            in the middle of the Universe, the &lsquo;middle of the light&rsquo; will be at
            the centre of the earth. See fig. i on p. 443. No other interpretation of <foreign lang="greek">κατὰ μέσον τὸ φῶς</foreign> is either natural or easy: see App. VI.
            It would seem therefore that at the end of the fourth day after leaving the meadow the
            souls are at the central point both of the Universe and of the Earth, as is maintained
            by, among others, Schneider and Donaldson (l.c. p. 307); and this view is also in
            harmony with some of the most important features in the remaining part of the narrative:
            see on 617 B, 621 A, B.</p>
          <p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">καὶ ἰδεῖν αὐτόθι κτλ.</lemma> &lsquo;and
            there, at the middle of the light, they saw, extended from heaven, the extremities of
            its chains; for this light chains the heavens, holding together all the revolving
            firmament, like the undergirders of men of war.&rsquo; The pronoun <foreign lang="greek">αὐτοῦ</foreign> is ambiguous, and as far as concerns the grammar might
            be referred either to <foreign lang="greek">τοῦ οὐρανοῦ</foreign> or to <foreign lang="greek">τὸ φῶς</foreign>. If we choose the former alternative, <foreign lang="greek">αὐτοῦ</foreign> will be an objective genitive, denoting that which is
            bound; if the latter, the meaning, as Professor Cook Wilson points out, is
            &lsquo;its chains,&rsquo; &lsquo;its bands,&rsquo; i.e. &lsquo;the
            chains of which the light consists,&rsquo; for in the next clause the light is said
            to be a chain (<foreign lang="greek">ξύνδεσμος</foreign>). The second of these views is
            on grammatical grounds somewhat more natural than the first; but whichever alternative
            we adopt, it is clear from the explanatory clause <foreign lang="greek">εἶναι
              γὰρ περιφοράν</foreign>, not only that the chains are the binding chains
            of heaven, but also that it is the light itself, and nothing else, which fulfils the
            function of binding the Universe together (<foreign lang="greek">εἶναι γὰρ τοῦτο τὸ
              φῶς ξύνδεσμον τοῦ οὐρανοῦ</foreign>). In what way the light performs this office,
            Plato indicates by the much-disputed words <foreign lang="greek">οἷον τὰ ὑποζώματα
              τῶν τριηρῶν</foreign>. The evidence on the subject of the
            &lsquo;undergirders&rsquo; of ancient men of war has been collected and
            discussed by Boeckh <hi rend="italic">Urkunden&uuml;ber d. Seewesen des Attischen
              Staates</hi> pp. 133&mdash;138: see also J. Smith <title>Voyage and Shipwreck of
              St Paul</title> pp. 210&mdash;215 and Breusing <title>Nautik d. Alten</title> pp.
            170&mdash;184. It may be taken as established that the <foreign lang="greek">ὑποζώματα</foreign> were ropes and not planks, as some of the ancient commentators
            supposed (e.g. Proclus <hi rend="italic">in remp.</hi> II p. 200. 25, a Scholiast quoted
            by Kroll l.c. II p. 381, and Suidas S.V. <foreign lang="greek">ὑποζώματα</foreign>,
            who follows a scholium on <bibl n="Aristoph. Kn. 279">Ar. <title>Knights</title>
            279</bibl>), and also that they were fastened round the <hi rend="italic">outside</hi>
            of the vessel; but on the question whether the <foreign lang="greek">ὑποζώματα</foreign> ran round the ship in a horizontal direction, or were passed
            under the hull, there is more room for difference of opinion. The former view is
            maintained by Boeckh and Breusing, the latter by J. Smith (l.c. pp. 108 f., 115,
            210&mdash;215), who reminds us that a similar process, known by the name of
            &lsquo;frapping,&rsquo; is still occasionally resorted to in the case of wooden
            ships during a storm at sea (pp. 108 f.). The evidence bearing on this matter has
            recently been investigated by Professor Cook Wilson (see Report of the Proceedings of
            the Oxford Philological Society for Hilary Term 1902 in <title>Cl. Rev.</title> XVI p.
            234), who will shortly publish a detailed discussion of the whole subject. In the
            meantime he writes to me as follows:&mdash;&ldquo;After careful reading of all
            the passages quoted by the authorities I feel sure (what one might infer <hi rend="italic">a priori</hi> from the mechanical conditions) that this
            method&rdquo; [i.e. frapping] &ldquo;was known to the ancients, and was the
            method used in an emergency at sea, as e.g. in St Paul's ship. I conjecture also that
            these undergirders first had the name <foreign lang="greek">ὑποζώματα</foreign>, and
            that if the belts or girdles supposed by Boeckh had this name, it was transferred to
            them from the true undergirders, which were probably the first and primitive form and
            remained in use always, even after the trireme belts had been invented.&rdquo; The
            evidence in short, points to two kinds of <foreign lang="greek">ὑποζώματα</foreign>
              (<title>Cl.</title>
            <pb n="446"/>
            <title>Rev.</title> l.c.), the first employed occasionally under exceptional
            circumstances, and passing under the hull of the vessel, the second (see Boeckh l.c. p.
            137) forming part of the regular equipment of a warship, attached before she went to
            sea, and running horizontally round the hull. The second variety is clearly represented
            on a bronze relief of the forepart of a war vessel, said to date from Roman imperial
            times, and now in the Berlin Museum. The sketch of the relief on p. 443, fig. ii is from
            a photograph in the possession of Professor Cook Wilson. There is also a (somewhat
            inaccurate) drawing of the relief in Beger <title>Thesauri regii et electoralis
              Brandenburgicii</title> Vol. III p. 406. (Some writers, and among them J. Smith, have
            maintained that the longitudinal bands in Beger's picture are only ornaments, and not
            ropes; but it is quite clear from the photograph that they are really ropes and serve as
              <foreign lang="greek">ὑποζώματα</foreign> of the horizontal kind.) To which of the
            two varieties does Plato here allude? The words <foreign lang="greek">οἷον τὰ
              ὑποζώματα τῶν τριηρῶν, οὕτω πᾶσαν συνέχον τὴν περιφοράν</foreign>, seem
            clearly to regard the <foreign lang="greek">ὑποζώματα</foreign> as permanent <foreign lang="greek">σκεύη</foreign> of warships, holding the hull together in ordinary
            circumstances, and not merely resources to be employed in times of difficulty and
            danger; and since the light whose action the <foreign lang="greek">ὑποζώματα</foreign>
            serve to illustrate is (in Plato's view) an essential part of the Universe, the
            illustration is better and more pointed if the <foreign lang="greek">ὑποζώματα</foreign> are also of the more permanent sort. It may also be noted that if
            Plato had meant the undergirders which pass under the keel he would probably have
            written <foreign lang="greek">ὑποζώματα τῶν νεῶν</foreign>, and not <foreign lang="greek">ὑποζώματα τῶν τριηρῶν</foreign>, for the vertical <foreign lang="greek">ὑποζώματα</foreign> were not confined to triremes. For these reasons it
            would seem that Plato has in view such <foreign lang="greek">ὑποζώματα</foreign> as
            are described by Boeckh, viz. girdles running round the hull from stern to stem outside
            the vessel.</p>
          <p>It is clear, therefore, that the light not only passes through the centre of the
            Universe, but also, since it holds the heavens together, like the undergirders of men of
            war, round the outer surface of the heavenly sphere.</p>
          <p>I have tried to represent the kind of picture in Plato's mind by fig. i on p. 443. The
            sphere of the heavens&mdash;represented by the circle <hi rend="italic">dd'</hi>,
            which is a section of the heavenly sphere&mdash;is virtually compared to a ship. The
            North pole, which is at <hi rend="italic">b</hi>, corresponds to the stem, and the South
            pole, which is at <hi rend="italic">c</hi>, to the stern of the vessel. The circular
            light <hi rend="italic">caba'c</hi> corresponds to the <foreign lang="greek">ὑποζώματα</foreign>, <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> being that part of the light which
            corresponds to the <foreign lang="greek">ὑποζώματα</foreign> on the port side, and <hi rend="italic">ca'b</hi> the portion which corresponds to the <foreign lang="greek">ὑποζώματα</foreign> on the starboard side. As the light in Plato's description
            passes through the centre of the Universe as well as round its exterior, the comparison
            of the light to horizontal <foreign lang="greek">ὑποζώματα</foreign> would be all the
            more apposite if we might suppose that these <foreign lang="greek">ὑποζώματα</foreign>
            were brought inside from stem to stern lengthwise and parallel to the ship's length, in
            a manner corresponding to the position of the straight part of the &lsquo;binding
            light.&rsquo; But for this supposition there is no evidence, and it is clear from
            fig. ii that the lower <foreign lang="greek">ὑποζώματα</foreign> at least could not
            have been brought inside, for they are below the water line. We must accordingly suppose
            that the comparison with <foreign lang="greek">ὑποζώματα</foreign> extends only to
            that part of the light which surrounds the surface of the heavenly sphere. That the ends
            of the light are brought inside the sphere in <hi rend="italic">Plato's</hi> picture is
            clear from the fact that the light stretches &lsquo;through all the heaven and
            earth&rsquo; as well as round the Universe, and also because the souls see the
            &lsquo;ends of its chains&rsquo; or bands at the middle of the light itself,
            which is also the centre of the Universe and Earth. We may presume that the <foreign lang="greek">ἄκρα τῶν δεσμῶν</foreign> meet together at the centre, so that <hi rend="italic">bc</hi> forms one continuous pillar of light stretching from pole to
            pole. See fig. i on p. 443.</p>
          <p>The light was interpreted by some ancient commentators as the axis of the Universe, or
            a cylinder of aetherial fire surrounding the axis (Theo p. 143 Hiller, Suidas and
            Photius S.V. <foreign lang="greek">τεταμένον φῶς</foreign>: cf. also Proclus <hi rend="italic">in remp.</hi> II p. 199. 31 ff.), by others as the <foreign lang="greek">γαλαξίας κύκλος</foreign> or Milky Way: see Proclus l.c. pp. 130. 4, 194. 19 ff.
            and Cicero <hi rend="italic">de rep.</hi> VI 16. According to the view given above, the
            column of light follows the direction of the axis of the Universe, if, as we may
            reasonably <pb n="447"/> suppose, <hi rend="italic">b</hi> is the pole, and although
            Plato nowhere actually calls it the axis, we may fairly suppose that this is what it
            symbolises. I have found no parallel in ancient astronomical theories to this conception
            of a light stretching from pole to pole. The curved part of the light is no doubt
            suggested by the Milky Way, which was regarded by the Pythagoreans as either identical
            with, or an emanation from the circle of fire which, according to them, held the
            Universe together (Zeller^{5} I p. 435 note 2). I have sometimes thought that the soul
            with which in the <title>Timaeus</title> the Creator wrapped the body of the Universe
            without has reference also to the Milky Way as girdling the World; for the Pythagoreans
            called the <foreign lang="greek">γαλαξίας κύκλος</foreign> the <foreign lang="greek">τόπος ψυχῶν</foreign>. Plato's words are (<bibl n="Plat. Tim. 34B"><title>Tim.</title> 34 B</bibl>) <foreign lang="greek">ψυχὴν δὲ εἰς τὸ μέσον
              αὐτοῦ θεὶς διὰ παντός τε ἔτεινε καὶ ἔτι ἔξωθεν τὸ σῶμα αὐτῇ
              περιεκάλυψε</foreign>. The parallel is certainly noteworthy, although <foreign lang="greek">περιεκάλυψε</foreign> in the <title>Timaeus</title> rather points to a
            complete envelopment of the heavens, and <foreign lang="greek">διὰ παντός</foreign> to
            the universal diffusion of the world-soul throughout the Universe.</p>

            from the extremities they saw extended the spindle of Necessity, by which all the
            revolving spheres are turned. The shaft and hook thereof are made of adamant, and the
            whorl partly of adamant, and partly of other materials.&rsquo; With this sentence we
            pass to the second part of Plato's description, in which he tries to depict the
            movements of the celestial bodies by a new image&mdash;that of Necessity and her
            spindle. Regarded in itself, this image is tolerably clear and coherent, if we are
            willing to allow a large admixture of supernatural mechanics; but Plato fails to shew
            how it is to be reconciled with what has just preceded, and no one has hitherto
            succeeded in effecting the reconciliation, without doing violence to the Greek. See on
            616 D, E and App. VI. The rapid imagination of the writer has already escaped from the
            earlier picture and fallen under the spell of a new conception, and we shall best
            apprehend his meaning if we consider what the peculiar nature of that conception
            demands. The ordinary spindle was shaped somewhat as in figure iii on p. 444, in which
              <hi rend="italic">a b</hi> is the shaft, and <hi rend="italic">c</hi> the whorl.
            (There is no hook in the figure: but its position would of course be at <hi rend="italic">a.</hi>) The fibres were attached to the hook and twisted into a thread
            by the revolutions communicated to the spindle by the finger and thumb: see
            Bl&uuml;mner <title>Technologie</title> etc. I pp. 109&mdash;120, from whom the
            figure is borrowed. It is essential to the notion of a spindle that the hook should be
            fastened to the fibres which are to be spun. For this reason Plato finds it necessary,
            in using the similitude of a spindle, to attach the hook (<foreign lang="greek">ἄγκιστρον</foreign>) to something which may correspond to the fibres; and he
            accordingly fastens it to the ends of the chains of light depending from the heavens in
            his previous image, at the point where these ends meet the ends from below, <foreign lang="greek">κατὰ μέσον τὸ φῶς</foreign>. If we treat this construction as a piece
            of serious mechanics, Plato's device is open to many obvious criticisms. In fastening
            the spindle to the <foreign lang="greek">ἄκρα τῶν δεσμῶν</foreign> from above, he
            forgets or ignores the ends from below. It will further be observed that he says nothing
            about the direction of the spindle: it is merely &lsquo;stretched from the
            ends&rsquo; of the chains. We shall presently see that the shaft of the spindle
            symbolises the axis of the Universe, so that&mdash;if we are to connect the two
            images in Plato's mind &mdash;it is natural to suppose that the spindle extends
            downwards, following the line of the light. Here again there are difficulties, the most
            serious of which perhaps is that, as the axis of the Universe must go through the earth,
            the effect of attaching the spindle &lsquo;at the middle of the light&rsquo;
            will be to depress the earth itself below the centre of the whole. But it should be
            remembered that Plato's object in this passage is not to furnish a scientific account of
            the celestial mechanism: see below on 616 D, E, 617 A. We are dealing with a work of
            literature and not of science, and the machinery of a myth ought not to be rigorously
            scrutinized from the scientific point of view. Inconsistencies of this kind are found to
            be inseparable from such poetical representations of the Universe. In the present case
            they arise chiefly from the juxtaposition of two essentially irreconcileable
            conceptions&mdash;that of a sphere girdled and traversed by light, and that of
            Necessity and her spindle. See on 616 D, E. For the rest, it should <pb n="448"/> be
            noted that adamant symbolises <foreign lang="greek">τὸ ἀπαθὲς καὶ
            ἀδάμαστον</foreign> (cf. Proclus l.c. II 209. 22), and is the appropriate material for
            the <foreign lang="greek">ἠλακάτη</foreign>, since in Plato's picture the <foreign lang="greek">ἠλακάτη</foreign> stands for the axis of the whole. <foreign lang="greek">ἠλακάτη</foreign> is not elsewhere found in the sense of the shaft of a
            spindle: ordinarily it means &lsquo;distaff.&rsquo; See on 616 D, E below. Plato
            does not inform us in what way the whorl is <foreign lang="greek">μεικτὸν ἔκ τε
              τούτου</foreign> (i.e. <foreign lang="greek">ἀδάμαντος</foreign>) <foreign lang="greek">καὶ ἄλλων γενῶν</foreign>: but I think he means that while the
            outermost circle, which is the circle of <foreign lang="greek">ταὐτόν</foreign> (<bibl n="Plat. Tim. 36C"><title>Tim.</title> 36 C</bibl>), is composed of adamant, the
            others, which form collectively the circle of <foreign lang="greek">θάτερον</foreign>,
            are made, either in whole or in part, of less durable stuff. Herwerden rejects the

            a spindle, I think it not unlikely that Proclus is right in this suggestion. For other

          <p>In the rims of the different whorls are set the fixed stars and planets in the

          <p>In the first. The fixed stars.</p>
          <p>In the second. Saturn.</p>

          <p>In the seventh. The Sun.</p>
          <p>In the eighth. The Moon.</p>
          <p>Cf. <bibl n="Plat. Tim. 38C"><title>Tim.</title> 38 C</bibl> f., where also, as here,
            Plato is following the Pythagorean order of planets: see Zeller^{5} I pp. 426 f. and (on
            the whole subject of ancient arrangements of the planets) Hultsch in PaulyWissowa, art.
              <title>Astronomie</title> and Schaubach <title>Gr. Astron.</title> pp. 398 ff. Some
            later authorities make Plato place Venus before <pb n="449"/> Mercury (see for example
            Diels <title>Doxogr. Gr.</title> p. 345), but the order which I have given is in accord
            with [<title>Epin.</title>] 986 C&mdash; 987 C, and with the views represented by
            Proclus l.c. p. 219. 3 ff.</p>
          <p>This conception of close-fitting concentric whorls, carrying the heavenly bodies in
            their rims or &lsquo;lips,&rsquo; appears to be unique in ancient astronomy. How
            was Plato led to devise so original an idea? Possibly in this way. It would seem that
            the Pythagoreans had already developed the astronomical doctrine of Anaximander into a
            theory of celestial spheres, maintaining that the stars were &ldquo;fastened in
            transparent circles or spheres, and turned round by the revolution of these circles on
            their axes&rdquo; (Zeller^{5} I p. 415). In order to suit his image of the spindle
            and whorl, Plato apparently takes these Pythagorean spheres, and cuts them in half,
            producing a series of hemispheric cups or whorls, in the circular
            &lsquo;lips&rsquo; of which the celestial bodies are fastened or bound (<foreign lang="greek">ἐνδεδεμένα</foreign>, says Theo 150. 14 Hiller: cf. also Proclus l.c.
            219. 24).</p>
          <p>So far as the Sun, Moon and Planets are concerned, the resulting picture is clear and
            intelligible, but it is impossible to conceive of the fixed stars as occupying the
            &lsquo;lip&rsquo; of one of the hemispherical whorls in the way in which the Sun
            for example may be supposed to do so. Whatever view we hold of the rest of the picture,
            it is likely that in this particular at least Plato himself did not think his comparison
            adequate to exhibit the phenomena: for in C above he has already represented the
            outermost heavens, in which dwell the fixed stars, not as the lip of a hemispherical
            shell or hollow, but as an actual sphere (<foreign lang="greek">πᾶσαν συνέχον τὴν
              περιφοράν</foreign>). (The inconsistency is noteworthy as shewing that the two images
            employed by Plato are fundamentally irreconcileable. See on 616 C.) By this and other
            indications we may be led to suspect that the whole theory of hemispherical whorls is
            only a device rendered necessary by Plato's similitude. If he had any opinion on the
            subject at all, he may have accepted the Pythagorean doctrine of spheres; but no
            conclusion on this matter can be drawn from the <title>Republic.</title> Cf. 617 A

          <p>1. Whorl of Fixed Stars (first)</p>
          <p>2. Whorl of Venus (sixth)</p>

          <p>7. Whorl of Jupiter (third)</p>
          <p>8. Whorl of Saturn (second).</p>
          <p>See fig. iv on p. 444. (This figure, which is a simplified form of a drawing in
            Professor Campbell's <hi rend="italic">Plato's Republic</hi>, published by Murray 1902,
            is intended to illustrate the upper surface of the whorl of Necessity's spindle. The
            small disc in the centre represents a section of the shaft, and the order of breadths of
            rim is indicated by the arabic numerals.) What does Plato mean us to understand by the
            different degrees of breadth of rim? On this subject I formerly
            wrote:&mdash;&ldquo;The simple and natural explanation is that the breadth of
            the rims represents the size of the different planets. Each rim must of necessity be
            broad enough to contain the planet which resides in it, and no reason can be conceived
            why it should be any broader&rdquo; (<title>Cl. Rev.</title> XV p. 392). In
            maintaining this view, I supposed that the surfaces of the different whorls were
            separated from one another by an interval representing the distances between the several
            planets, interpreting <foreign lang="greek">νῶτον</foreign> in 616 E (with Jowett) as
            the <hi rend="italic">lower</hi> and not the <hi rend="italic">upper</hi> side of the
            entire whorl. But, as Professor Cook Wilson points out, the Greek does not allow of this
            interpretation, for <foreign lang="greek">ἁρμόττων, καθάπερ οἱ κάδοι οἱ εἰς
              ἀλλήλους ἁρμόττοντες</foreign>, and <foreign lang="greek">νῶτον συνεχὲς ἑνὸς
              σφονδύλου ἀπεργαζομένους περὶ τὴν ἠλακάτην</foreign> (616 D, E) shew
            conclusively that the individual whorls are fitted closely into one another like a nest
            of boxes, their upper surfaces forming one continuous plane. Cf. Proclus <pb n="450"/>
            l. c. 216. 8 <foreign lang="greek">μηδενὸς γὰρ ὄντος κενοῦ μεταξὺ τῶν
              ἐνηρμοσμένων σφονδύλων κτλ.</foreign> From this it follows that, if the breadth of
            a rim is equal to the diameter of its planet, &ldquo;planets in the same part of
            their orbit will touch one another, and if we carry out the principle to the centre
            whorl, the moon will be always touching the earth. Moreover the outer planet will be
            continually grazing a fixed star&rdquo; (Cook Wilson). These considerations are
            fatal to the view which I advocated; and I take this opportunity of retractation. The
            theory which has most in its favour, as I now see, is that &ldquo;the breadth of the
            rims is intended to signify the supposed distances of the orbits from each
            other&rdquo; (Jowett and Campbell). &ldquo;It would be extraordinary,&rdquo;
            writes Professor Cook Wilson, &ldquo;that Plato in representing the heavenly system
            by his whorls should not have represented somehow the distances between the orbits of
            the heavenly bodies, and the obvious way to do this was by making the thickness of the
            spheres to which they are attached, or (as he prefers whorls on account of the distaff
            of Necessity), the breadth of the rims of the whorls, symbolise these different
            distances.&rdquo; On this view the natural position of the planet will be
            &ldquo;close to the outer edge of its rim, and touching the outer surface of its
            hemisphere.&rdquo; For a further discussion of this subject see App. VI.</p>

          <p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">κυκλεῖσθαι δὲ δὴ κτλ.</lemma> Cf. <bibl n="Plat. Tim. 36C"><title>Tim.</title> 36 C</bibl>, D. The whorl of the fixed stars
            revolves from East to West, bearing with <pb n="451"/> it in its revolution the other
            seven whorls. In this way Plato portrays the apparent daily revolution of the stars and
            planets. In order to represent the movements of the Sun, Moon and planets in their own
            particular orbits, Plato says that each of the seven inner whorls is all the while
            pursuing on its own account a motion in the opposite direction, viz. from West to East.
            The revolving whorls in the words of Proclus, &lsquo;carry round the
            stars&rsquo; (<foreign lang="greek">περιάγουσι τοὺς ἀστέρας</foreign> l. c. p.
            226. 12) which are situated in their rims.</p>
          <p>Would the mechanism of Plato's picture really produce the movements which it is
            intended to portray? The question may be interesting, but is irrelevant. Imaginary
            machines have imaginary properties; and Plato himself invokes the assistance of
            supernatural beings to carry on the movements (617 C). The important point to keep in
            mind, as Professor Cook Wilson observes, is that &ldquo;Plato has realised that the
            apparent phenomena are what we call a composition of movements (or velocities). This
            composition of movements he is not attempting to explain, by giving the sort of
            machinery which he thought really produced it, but he is endeavouring to make us
            understand what the movements <hi rend="italic">are</hi> (not how they originate), by
            putting the objects concerned in an imaginary machine, the movements of which we can
            represent to the senses, and which would produce such movements in the objects as they
            actually have.&rdquo; For similar reasons it is impossible to draw any inference
            from this passage as to the question whether Plato believed in the daily revolution of
            the earth. In the <title>Timaeus</title>, according to Grote (<hi rend="italic">Plato on
              the Earth's Rotation</hi>, pp. 13 ff.), the cosmical axis is &ldquo;a solid
            cylinder revolving or turning round, and causing thereby the revolution of the
            circumference or the sidereal sphere,&rdquo; and necessarily also carrying round
            with itself the Earth, which is massed or globed round the axis of the whole (<foreign lang="greek">εἰλλομένην περὶ τὸν διὰ παντὸς πόλον τεταμένον</foreign>
            <bibl n="Plat. Tim. 40B"><title>Tim.</title> 40 B</bibl>. &lsquo;Massed&rsquo;
            or &lsquo;packed&rsquo; is Boeckh's interpretation of <foreign lang="greek">εἰλλομένην</foreign>, with which Grote also agrees; but whether the word really
            bears this meaning, is another question, which we need not here discuss.) In support of
            his explanation of the passage in the <title>Timaeus</title>, Grote appeals to the myth
            of the <title>Republic</title>; and the appeal would be justified if Plato's figure of
            Necessity's spindle were intended to explain the <hi rend="italic">cause</hi>, and not
            merely to represent the <hi rend="italic">form</hi>, of the celestial motions. As it is,
            the <title>Republic</title> does not warrant any conclusion either way. Cf. 616 D, E

            21. Plato's <hi rend="italic">language</hi> certainly means that these three bodies
            travel at the same pace, and if their speed is the same, obviously they cannot complete
            their orbits in the same period. But it is doubtful whether the contradiction was
            present to Plato's mind, and Proclus may be right in holding that Plato was really
            thinking of the periods of the planets (l.c. and <hi rend="italic">in Tim.</hi> 259 C).

            577 note 3. (Zeller identifies this <foreign lang="greek">Ἀνάγκη</foreign> with the

            The interpretation of Plato's symbolism of course is that Necessity and Law spin the
            threads of life&mdash;the life of the Universe as well as that of man. <foreign lang="greek">ἐν τοῖς τῆς Ἀνάγκης γόνασιν</foreign> is an echo of <foreign lang="greek">θεῶν ἐν γούνασι κεῖται</foreign> and the like: cf. Proclus l.c. 227.

            Cf. <title>Merchant of Venice</title> V I &ldquo;There's not the smallest orb which
            thou behold'st, But in his motion <hi rend="italic">like an angel</hi> sings.&rdquo;
            Plato goes beyond Shakespeare, setting the angels on the orbs and making them sing. Cf.
            Milton <title>Arcades</title> 63 ff. &ldquo;the celestial Sirens' harmony That sit
            upon the nine&rdquo;&mdash;in Plato there are only eight&mdash;
            &ldquo;infolded Spheres.&rdquo; The seven planets by their movements were
            supposed by the Pythagoreans to give forth sounds corresponding to the notes of the
            Heptachord. This was probably the original form of the &lsquo;Music of the
            Spheres.&rsquo; Later, it was held that the circle of the fixed stars had also a
            note of its own, and a &lsquo;harmony&rsquo; or mode (see on III 398 E ff.)
            resulted like that of the Octachord. The underlying idea of the doctrine of the
            &lsquo;Music of the Spheres&rsquo; was well expressed by Dorylaus when he said
            the Universe was the &lsquo;organum Dei&rsquo; (Censor. <hi rend="italic">de die

            single sound, a single musical note.&rsquo; &ldquo;Additum <foreign lang="greek">ἕνα τόνον</foreign> per epexegesin est&rdquo; (Stallbaum). Cf. Proclus l.c.
            236. 27 ff. <foreign lang="greek">ἡ μὲν γὰρ μία φωνὴ δηλοῖ τὴν ἀμετάβολον τοῦ
              τῆς ἐνεργείας εἴδους εἰς ἄλλο καὶ ἄλλο μέλος ὕπαρξιν, ὡς ἑκάστης

            though less than in <foreign lang="greek">τὸ δεινόν, τὸ μέγα</foreign> IX 590 A. The
            reading <foreign lang="greek">ἕνα τόνον</foreign> is confirmed by Plut. <hi rend="italic">de anim. procr.</hi> 1029 C and Proclus <hi rend="italic">in Tim.</hi>
            259 C and <hi rend="italic">in remp.</hi> l.c. et al. It is difficult to understand
              <foreign lang="greek">ἀνὰ τόνον</foreign>, which Hermann and Baiter read, following
              <hi rend="italic">q</hi> and a few inferior MSS. <foreign lang="greek">ἀνὰ
            τόνον</foreign> could hardly mean &lsquo;one note each,&rsquo; as Hermann
            supposes. With regard to the <foreign lang="greek">ἁρμονία</foreign> itself, the pitch
            of the several notes will of course be determined by the speed of the different whorls
            (cf. VII 530 D note), so that if we express the notes by the names of the circles which
            produce them, the <foreign lang="greek">ἁρμονία</foreign> will be:&mdash;
            <figure/></p>
          <p>It is clear that Plato is thinking of a sort of mode (<foreign lang="greek">ἐκ πασῶν
              δὲ ὀκτὼ οὐσῶν μίαν ἁρμονίαν ξυμφωνεῖν</foreign>), but if we understand
              <foreign lang="greek">ἅμα ἀλλήλοις</foreign> strictly, there will only be six
            notes, because Mercury, Venus and the Sun will each have the same note. Difficulties of
            this sort might have troubled the later Pythagoreans, but scarcely Plato, least of all
            in an imaginative picture of this kind. We note however that according to Plato the
            speed of the planets&mdash;except in the case of the Sun, Venus and
            Mercury&mdash;diminishes in proportion to their distance from the Earth. Now we may
            reasonably suppose that Plato thought the more distant planets took longer to complete
            their orbit than those which are nearer, so that <pb n="453"/> it is by no means
            improbable that in speaking of the speed of the planetary movements, Plato really had in
            his mind the time occupied by the orbital periods and not the rate of progression of the
            planets themselves. See also above on <foreign lang="greek">ἅμα ἀλλήλοις</foreign>.
            In that case the octave will be complete, because in order to complete their orbits in
            the same time, the Sun, Venus and Mercury will have to travel at different rates of
            speed. Later writers knew all about the Music of the Spheres, and a choir of eight
            Neo-Pythagoreans would have had no difficulty in rendering it on a small scale: see for
            example von Jan's <title>Mus. Scr. Gr.</title> pp. 241 ff., 271 ff., 418 f. Cf. also

            what Plato means: for it would seem from what is said of Clotho and Lachesis that the

            transient. In themselves of course, they are immortal&mdash;<foreign lang="greek">ψυχὴ πᾶσα ἀθάνατος</foreign> (<bibl n="Plat. Phaedrus 245C"><title>Phaedr.</title>
              245 C</bibl>). The explanation of Proclus is somewhat different, and, as often
            happens, too recondite: <foreign lang="greek">τὰς μὲν ἀνθρωπίνας ψυχάς, οὔτι γε

            accompanied throughout its life on earth by a <foreign lang="greek">δαίμων</foreign> of
            its own. This <foreign lang="greek">δαίμων</foreign> is the personification of its
            destiny throughout that particular life&mdash;its <hi rend="italic">genius</hi> in

            <title>Epp.</title> II 2. 189), according as the soul is <foreign lang="greek">εὐδαίμων</foreign> or <foreign lang="greek">κακοδαίμων</foreign>. There are not a
            few traces of this belief before the time of Plato, e.g. in Heraclitus' famous saying
              <foreign lang="greek">ἦθος ἀνθρώπῳ δαίμων</foreign> (<bibl n="Plat. Fr. 121B"><title>Fr.</title> 121 B</bibl>ywater) in Pind. <title>Ol.</title> 13. 28 <foreign lang="greek">Ζεῦ πάτερΞενοφῶντος εὔθυνε δαίμονος οὖρον</foreign>,
            and often in Euripides (examples in N&auml;gelsbach <title>Nachhom. Theol.</title>
            p. 113); and D&ouml;ring (l.c. p. 489) is no doubt right in holding that the
            doctrine was not exclusively Orphic or Pythagorean. According to the popular view, which
            Plato himself is content to make use of in <bibl n="Plat. Phaedo 107D"><title>Phaed.</title> 107 D</bibl>
            <foreign lang="greek">ὁ ἑκάστου δαίμων, ὅσπερ ζῶντα εἰλήχει</foreign>, we do
            not <hi rend="italic">choose</hi> our <foreign lang="greek">δαίμων</foreign>, but are
            rather allotted to it: cf. <title>Theocr.</title> 4. 40 <foreign lang="greek">αἲ αἲ
              τῶ σκληρῶ μάλα δαίμονος, ὅς με λέλογχεν</foreign>, and the fine lines of

            the individual is <hi rend="italic">himself</hi> responsible for his destiny (<foreign lang="greek">ἀλλ’ ὑμεῖσαἱρήσεσθε</foreign>). Hence <foreign lang="greek">αἰτία ἑλομένου· θεὸς ἀναίτιος</foreign>. On later, especially

            in so far as it is good (VI 509 B ff.), so that our truest individuality is nothing more
            or less than that which is the best and highest part of our nature: cf. the words of
            Aristotle, who in <title>Eth. Nic.</title> X 7. 1178^{a} 2 <foreign lang="greek">πλατωνίζει</foreign> as follows: <foreign lang="greek">δόξειε δ’ ἂν καὶ εἶναι

            We therefore attain our fullest development and enjoy our only true liberty as
            individuals by becoming servants of Virtue. In the words of Goethe, &ldquo;Das
            Gesetz nur kann uns Freiheit geben.&rdquo; Proclus' comment, though true and
            instructive as far as it goes, does not exhaust the significance of Plato's saying:
              <foreign lang="greek">ἀδέσποτον δὲ τὴν ἀρετήν, ἀλλ’ οὐ διὰ τὸ ἐφ’ ἡμῖν
              μόνον, ἀλλὰ διότι τὴν ψυχὴν ἐλευθέραν ἀποτελεῖ τῶν πικροτάτων δεσποτῶν,

            of moral freedom is to be found in the Socratic <foreign lang="greek">οὐδεὶς ἑκὼν
              πονηρός</foreign> (see on IX 577 D, E): for its sequel, we should look to the Stoic

          <p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ζῴων τε γὰρ κτλ.</lemma> Did Plato seriously
            believe in the transmigration of the soul? Teichm&uuml;ller summarily dismisses the
            entire theory as unplatonic (<title>Die Plat. Frage</title> pp. 1&mdash;20), while
            Susemihl, in harmony with certain ancient writers (see the references in Simson
              <title>Der Begriff d. Seele bei Platon</title> p. 152 note), takes Plato at his word
            so far as concerns the passage of the soul into new human bodies, but refuses to allow
            that he could have believed in transmigration into the forms of the lower animals
              (<title>Genet. Entwick.</title> II p. 272). Plato's language is however quite
            explicit, and there is the less reason for resorting to an allegorical interpretation,
            because the doctrine was already familiar in Greek philosophical and religious thought
            (see F. Laudowicz <hi rend="italic">Wesen u. Ursprung d. Lehre v. d.
              Pr&auml;existenz d. Seele</hi> etc. pp. 12&mdash;29 and Rohde
            <title>Psyche</title>^{2} II pp. 162 ff.), and is itself in general conformity with
            Plato's own conception of immortality. The doctrine of transmigration meets us
            frequently in Plato's dialogues, e.g. in <bibl n="Plat. Meno 81A"><title>Men.</title> 81
              A</bibl> ff.; <bibl n="Plat. Phaedo 81E"><title>Phaed.</title> 81 E</bibl> ff., 113 A;
              <bibl n="Plat. Phaedrus 249B"><title>Phaedr.</title> 249 B</bibl>; <bibl n="Plat. Tim. 42B"><title>Tim.</title> 42 B</bibl> ff.: cf. 91 D ff. Most if not all
            of these passages have a mythical colouring, and should therefore be read in the light
            of the caveat which Plato subjoins to the eschatological myth of the
            <title>Phaedo</title>: <foreign lang="greek">τὸ μὲν οὖν ταῦτα διισχυρίσασθαι
              οὕτως ἔχειν, ὡς ἐγὼ διελήλυθα, οὐ πρέπει νοῦν ἔχοντι ἀνδρί· ὅτι
              μέντοι ἢ ταῦτ’ ἐστιν ἢ τοιαῦτ’ ἄττα περὶ τὰς ψυχὰς

              πρέπειν μοι δοκεῖ καὶ ἄξιον κινδυνεῦσαι οἰομένῳ οὕτως ἔχειν</foreign>
            (114 D). That soul is immortal, Plato is firmly convinced: and transmigration he regards
            as probable, to say the least. Cf. 608 D note</p>

            wonder. In most cases, the souls chose in conformity with their previous
            lives&mdash;Orpheus, for example, selecting the life of a swan, Ajax that of a lion,

          <p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">γενέσθαι -- γενέσθαι</lemma>. &ldquo;Is Plato
            really responsible for the clumsy and ill-sounding repetition of <foreign lang="greek">γενέσθαι</foreign>?&rdquo; Richards, who would omit the first <foreign lang="greek">γενέσθαι</foreign> and write <foreign lang="greek">κατὰ
            μέσας</foreign> for <foreign lang="greek">καὶ μέσας</foreign>. A similar correction
            had already been suggested by Herwerden. Plato himself is not in the least averse to
            echoes of this kind: see on VI 511 E.</p>
          <p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ἄνω</lemma>. It follows that the souls just before
            their reincarnation are underground: see on <foreign lang="greek">Ἀνάγκης
            γόνασιν</foreign> 617 B and <foreign lang="greek">διὰ καύματος κτλ.</foreign> 621 A
            and Virg. <title>Aen.</title> VI 748 ff. Has omnis&mdash;Lethaeum ad fluvium deus
            evocat agmine magno: Scilicet immemores <hi rend="italic">supera</hi> ut convexa

          <p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">εἰς -- ἀστέρας</lemma> is an
            instance&mdash;rare in Plato&mdash;of an apparently accidental iambic. See
            Arist. <title>Rhet.</title> III 8. 1408^{b} 33 ff. <foreign lang="greek">ὁ δ’ ἴαμβος
              αὐτή ἐστιν ἡ λέξις ἡ τῶν πολλῶν· διὸ μάλιστα πάντων τῶν μέτρων ἰαμβεῖα
              φθέγγονται λέγοντες</foreign> and Cope ad loc. For souls conceived as stars cf.
              <bibl n="Aristoph. Peace 833">Ar. <title>Peace</title> 833</bibl> f. <foreign lang="greek">οὐκ ἦν ἄρ’ οὐδ’ ὃ λέγουσι κατὰ τὸν ἀέρα</foreign> &verbar; <foreign lang="greek">ὡς ἀστέρες γιγνόμεθ’ , ὅταν τις ἀποθάνῃ;</foreign> and Plut.

              χάσμα παλλομένους</foreign> (said of disembodied souls) and 591 F. Similarly the
            Milky Way which, in the words of Milton, is &lsquo;powdered with stars&rsquo;
              (<title>Par. Lost</title> VII 581: cf. Arist. <title>Meteor.</title> I 8), is the
            abode of certain souls, according to a tolerably widespread tradition, which meets us
            also in antiquity: see for example Cic. <title lang="la">de repub.</title> VI 15, 16 and
              <title>Manil.</title> I 753&mdash; 804. Cf. also Ettig <title>Acherunt.</title>

          <p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ἕωθεν</lemma>
            <foreign lang="greek">. ἄνωθεν</foreign> (see cr. n.), which appears also in <title type="MS">v<title>, is approved by Richards, but adds nothing to the meaning. <foreign lang="greek">ἕωθεν</foreign> is of course the morning of the twelfth day as
                  <foreign lang="greek">μέσας νύκτας</foreign> above was the midnight of the
                eleventh: cf. <foreign lang="greek">δωδεκαταῖος ἀνεβίω</foreign> 614 B

          <p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">κείμενον</lemma>. See cr. n. <foreign lang="greek">ἤδη</foreign> is inappropriate in itself, and has little authority besides A^{2}.</p>
          <p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">μῦθος -- οὐκ ἀπώλετο</lemma>. A Scholiast
            remarks: <foreign lang="greek">τοῖς μὲν οὖν πολλοῖς προστιθέναι τοῖς μύθοις
              ἔθος ἦν, ὅτι μῦθος ἀπώλετο, δεικνύναι βουλομένοις ὡς ἄρα οἱ μῦθοι
              λέγουσι μὴ ὄντα, καὶ ἅμα ἐρρήθησαν καὶ οὐκ εἰσίν</foreign>. (Cf. <bibl n="Plat. Theaet. 164D"><title>Theaet.</title> 164 D</bibl> and <bibl n="Plat. Phileb. 14A"><title>Phil.</title> 14 A</bibl>.) <foreign lang="greek">Πλάτων
              δὲ τοὐναντίον πανταχοῦ σῴζεσθαί τε καὶ σῴζειν φησὶ τοὺς μύθους τοὺς παρ’
              αὑτῷ, μάλα γε εἰκότως· τῶν γὰρ ὄντων εἰσὶν ἐξηγηταί, καὶ ὠφέλιμοι
              διὰ τοῦτο</foreign>. (The Scholium is from Proclus l.c. 354. 24 ff.). Plato means
            that the story of Er is <foreign lang="greek">οὐκ ὄναρ, ἀλλ’ ὕπαρ
            ἐσθλόν</foreign>. A similar play on the proverb occurs also in <title>Laws</title> 645

          <p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ἂν σώσειεν</lemma>. Cf. III 417 A note The

          <p>, D 20 <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">αὐτοῦ τε -- εὖ πράττωμεν</lemma>. I agree
            with Richards in taking <foreign lang="greek">τε</foreign> as
            &lsquo;both,&rsquo; not &lsquo;and,&rsquo; and the <foreign lang="greek">καί</foreign> before <foreign lang="greek">ἐνθάδε</foreign> as
            &lsquo;and,&rsquo; not &lsquo;both.&rsquo; Schneider holds the opposite
            view, urging that &ldquo;qui praemia virtutis reportat, eum inter reportandum et
            sibi et diis amicum esse oportet. Eo igitur tempore sibi diisque amicus ut sit,
            contendere non magis potest, quam ut vincat, quum palmam fert victoriae.&rdquo; This
            is true enough, but a similar objection may be made against Schneider's own solution,
            which makes Plato say <foreign lang="greek">ἵνα,
              ἐπειδὰνκομιζώμεθαεὖ πράττωμεν</foreign>: and, with
            Schneider's construction, the repetition <foreign lang="greek">καὶ ἐνθάδε</foreign>
            is also, as Richards says, &lsquo;very weak.&rsquo; Beginning as if he would say
            &lsquo;both here and hereafter&rsquo; Plato elaborates the
            &lsquo;hereafter&rsquo; into <foreign lang="greek">ἐπειδὰν
              κομιζώμεθα</foreign>, not without some sacrifice of logical coherence.</p>
          <p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">περιαγειρόμενοι</lemma>: i.q. <foreign lang="greek">περιιόντες καὶ ἀγειρόμενοι</foreign>. Cf. Tim. <title>Lex. Plat.</title> s.v.
              <foreign lang="greek">περιαγειρόμενοι νικηφόροι</foreign> and Ruhnken's note.
              <foreign lang="greek">ἐπαγερμός</foreign> was the name for this kind of
            &lsquo;stipis collectio.&rsquo; The poet Gray proposed <foreign lang="greek">περιαγόμενοι</foreign>, but the text is sound. For the imagery from the games see on
            V 465 D note</p>
          <p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">διεληλύθαμεν</lemma>. J. and C. think there is
            &ldquo;a playful suggestion of our having made the pilgrimage ourselves.&rdquo;
            I do not believe Plato means more than merely &lsquo;we have described.&rsquo;</p>
          <p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">εὖ πράττωμεν</lemma>. On <foreign lang="greek">εὖ πράττωμεν</foreign> see the third Platonic epistle ad init. and Bernays
              <title>Lucian u. die Kyniker</title> pp. 3, 88. The <title>Republic</title> fitly ends
            with an adaptation of Plato's favourite phrase of salutation and farewell.</p>
