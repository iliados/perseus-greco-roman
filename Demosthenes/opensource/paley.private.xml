<head>Explanation of the symbols used in this edition in recording various readings.</head>
<p>As a general rule, wherever the text (that of W. Dindorf's fourth Edition, as revised by Blass in 1889) agrees with that of the Zurich editors, I have not thought it necessary to notice any variations in the MSS. Where Dindorf differs from the Zurich editors, the difference is in most cases due to the greater weight given by the latter to the readings of the Paris MS S.</p>
<p>Z stands for the Z&uuml;r&iacute;ch text of Demosthenes as printed by J. G. Barter and H Sauppe in their excellent edition of the <title>Oratores Attici,</title> in one volume (1850).</p>
<p>&lsquo;Bekker st.&rsquo; is Bekker's stereotyped edition published at Leipzig in 1854. The readings adopted in his Berlin ed. 1824 have been occasionally recorded. When Dindorf differs from the Zurich editors, he generally agrees with Bekker. When a note begins with Bekk., it is meant that Dindorf's text is supported by Bekker's Berlin and Leipzig editions: then, after a slight space, follows the reading of the Zurich editors (Z) with the MSS supporting it, introduced by the word <foreign lang="la">cum.</foreign></p>
<p>The MSS thus quoted by the Zurich editors are as follows:</p>
<p>S (or <foreign lang="greek">Σ</foreign>) in the <foreign lang="fr">Biblioth&egrave;que Nationale,</foreign> Paris (No. 2934), on parchment; of century X. This is admitted on all hands to be the best MS, and its readings are very often accepted by Bekker and still more frequently by the Z&uuml;rich editors. (For a protest against <emph>excessive</emph> deference to its authority, see the Preface of Mr Shilleto's fourth edition of the <title>De falsa legatione,</title> pp. vii, viii, xiv.) It was published in facsimile in 1893, Paris (Leroux).</p>
<p>F. <title>Codex Marcianus</title> (No. 416), in the Library of St Mark's, Venice, on parchment; of century XI. The best MS of the second group or family (Dindorf), but closely followed by the <title>Codex Bavaricus</title> (B).</p>

<head><foreign lang="greek">ΠΡΟΣ ΦΟΡΜΙΩΝΑ ΠΕΡΙ ΔΑΝΕΙΟΥ</foreign>:  Chrysippus v. Phormion</head>
<div type="section" n="0">
	<p>THIS oration, like those against Zenothemis, Lacritus, and Dionysodorus, is on the subject of bottomry, or a loan of money made on the security of a ship or a cargo or both, and either for the outer voyage only or the return-voyage also, as agreed upon. These transactions were very numerous at Athens, and chiefly on account of the trade in corn. The risk was great, and therefore the interest demanded was large, the lender in fact charging a rate that would cover insurance besides leaving a good profit for the use of the money<note anchored="yes"><p>The student will do well to read carefully the ninth chapter, Book I of Boeckh's &lsquo;Public Economy,&rsquo; on the Foreign Trade of Attica, and also the twentythird of the same Book, on Loans upon Bottomry. [Cf. K. F. Hermann, <title lang="de">Privatalterth&uuml;mer,</title> p. 459 ed. Bl&uuml;mner; B&uuml;chsensch&uuml;tz, <title>Besitz und Erwerb,</title> pp. 486&mdash;490; and Smith's <title>Dict. of Ant.</title> s.v. <title>Fenus,</title> i 833{3}. S.]</p></note>.</p>
<p>The case in this oration is quite simple. Chrysippus lent Phormion, a merchant or trader, 20 minae (about &pound;80) for a voyage to Bosporus (in the <title>Crimea</title>) and back (&sect; 6). The contract required Phormion, when he had sold his cargo of goods at the mart there, to take on board a return-cargo, from the profits of which, or of both, he was to repay the loan with interest at thirty per cent.  <pb n="2"/> at Athens. But being unable to sell his wares in Bosporus, he desired the skipper, Lampis, to sail back to Athens without him, promising that he would soon follow. It so happened that Lampis' ship was wrecked; and though Phormion, having no goods on board, was not in any way a loser by the accident, he evaded his liability by falling back on a clause in the contract, which exempted him from payment if his ship failed to come in safe to the Peiraeus. It is on this point that the action turns. Chrysippus gives evidence that Phormion never thought of disputing his liability at first, on his return to Athens, but trumped up the excuse at a subsequent time in collusion with Lampis.</p>
<p>Chrysippus then brings an action, of the class called <foreign lang="greek">ἐμπορικαὶ δίκαι</foreign>, to compel Phormion to pay his claims. Phormion objects that the suit cannot be maintained, because he has done nothing to violate the terms of the contract. This objection is now answered by Chrysippus. The speech is accordingly directed against the <foreign lang="greek">παραγραφή</foreign> or special plea which had been put in by Phormion, and shows grounds why the action can be and ought to be tried.</p>
<p>The liability to pay had been at first admitted by Phormion: but he afterwards denied it, and when the case was submitted to arbitration by mutual consent (&sect; 18) he had suborned Lampis (who on a former occasion had, virtually at least, admitted that he had not been paid anything by Phormion) to swear that he had received the money from him in Bosporus, and had lost it in the ship which had been wrecked. Chrysippus handles the accounts in a very dexterous way, and convicts Phormion of falsehood by showing that the money he pretended to have paid Lampis was a great deal too much. He dwells also on the improbability of so large a sum having been paid without any witness to the <pb n="3"/> transaction, and urges that the clause in the contract, making the safety of the ship a condition of the liability, must be taken in close connexion with another clause, which compels the borrower to put goods on board for the home voyage; which Phormion had been unable to do.</p>
<p>The <foreign lang="greek">παραγραφή</foreign>, or special plea, might have been put in, says Chrysippus, if the transaction had not been made in, or in connexion with, the Attic mart. But the law is explicit in stating (&sect; 42) that all disputes about contracts so made shall be brought before the Attic courts. And the defence set up, viz. that the money was paid, is not a ground for a special plea at all; it is simply a defence in an ordinary action (<foreign lang="greek">εὐθυδικία</foreign>).</p>
<p>The Phormion in this suit <foreign lang="greek">πρὸς Φορμίωνα</foreign> is quite a distinct person from the Phormion in <title>Or.</title> 36, <foreign lang="greek">ὑπὲρ Φορμίωνος</foreign>, who was a liberated slave, and concerned in a banking transaction. [In the present speech it would appear that neither Phormion nor Chrysippus was a citizen of Athens; like Lampis, the skipper, probably both of the litigants were <foreign lang="greek">μέτοικοι</foreign>.]</p>
<p>The date of the speech is approximately fixed by the mention of Paerisades in &sect; 8, as king of Bosporus, which office he held from B.C. 348 to 310, and also by the allusion in &sect; 38 to the capture of Thebes by Alexander, B.C. 335. [The famine-prices of &sect; 34 belong to the years 330&mdash;29 and 328&mdash;7. Thus the speech belongs to the year 327&mdash;6. The late date and the general style of the speech have led the majority of modern critics to deny that it was written by Demosthenes.]</p>

</p>
<p><title>Argument.</title> <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">κατέλαβεν κ.τ.λ.</lemma> &lsquo;He found there was no market for the wares he was bringing.&rsquo; What these were, does not appear. Probably it was a mixed cargo on speculation. He called it <foreign lang="greek">ῥῶπος</foreign>, &lsquo;trash,&rsquo; in a fit of ill-temper at his failure, in &sect; 9.
</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">φορτίων ὧν ἐκόμιζε</lemma> This is an instance of attraction to an antecedent which is expressed, whereas the usage is much more common when the antecedent is omitted, and the case of the word to be supplied is shifted as it were on to the relative, by which the ellipse is sufficiently indicated. This attraction takes place <hi rend="italic">only</hi> where the proper case of the relative is the accusative. We may say <foreign lang="greek">κατάλογος βιβλίων ὧν ἔχομεν</foreign> or <foreign lang="greek">ἃ ἔχομεν</foreign>, but not <foreign lang="greek">ὧν χρὠμεθα</foreign>, because <foreign lang="greek">ὧν</foreign> may represent <foreign lang="greek">ἅ</foreign>, but not <foreign lang="greek">οἷς</foreign>.</p>
<p>ibid. <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ναυκλήρου</lemma> &lsquo;The skipper.&rsquo; The word seems pr<hi rend="italic">o</hi>perly to mean one who has a share or interest in a ship; a part-owner, or one who has hired it for a time (Phot. in v.). Hesych, explains it by <foreign lang="greek">ὁ δεσπότης τοῦ πλοίου</foreign>. [Lampis, however, was only a freedman, representing his former master. Cf. Lacrit. &sect; 33 (<foreign lang="greek">μαρτυρίαι</foreign>) <foreign lang="greek">Ὑβλήσιος ἐν αυκλήρει ...κοινωνεῖν δὲ καὶ αὐτὸς τῆς νεως Ὑβλησιῳ, καὶ συμπλεῖν ἑαυτοῦ οἰκέτας εν τῇ νηἰ</foreign>.

</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">τὰ ἀγοράσματα</lemma> The goods purchased with, or in place of (i.e. as security for), the money he had borrowed from Chrysippus.
</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ἀργύριον</lemma> The money he ought to have made by the transaction, and given to Lampis to hand over to Chrysippus on his return.
</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ἐν τῷ λέμβῳ</lemma> Lampis, with a few others (some thirty being lost, &sect; 10), gets safe to land in the ship's boat.
</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ἀπαιτούμενος</lemma> &lsquo;On being asked for payment.&rsquo; [For <foreign lang="greek">ἀπαιτεῖν</foreign>, <hi rend="italic">rem debitam reposcere,</hi> cf. &sect; 12 and note on <bibl n="Dem. 53.10">Or. 53 &sect; 10</bibl>. For the passive of the person, cf. Xen. Apol. 17 <foreign lang="greek">ἀπαιτεῖσθαι εὐεργεσίαν</foreign>. S.]
</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">τὴν γὰρ συγγραφὴν</lemma> &lsquo;The compact expressly says that if anything happens to the ship at sea, Phormion is discharged from his debt to Chrysippus.&rsquo; Loans on bottomry partook of the nature of insurance also, i.e. the profit on the loan was so large (&sect; 23), that it covered some total losses resulting from wrecks or loss of goods from pirates, storms, or other unavoidable mishaps.
</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">παρεγράψατο</lemma> Phormion put in a demurrer or bar to the suit, trying to show there was no ground for action at all, as he had kept the terms of the contract.
</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">παρὰ τῷ διαιτητῇ</lemma> Lampis had given false testimony when the case was brought before the <pb n="7"/> arbitrator, Theodotus, &sect; 18, for he had been bribed by Phormion to say anything to get him off. It appears from &sect; 18 that a witness was not likely to be prosecuted for <foreign lang="greek">ψευδομαρτυρία</foreign> given before an arbitrator.
</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ἐντέθεικεν</lemma> This perfect is one of the middle-Attic forms. It occurs first in Eur. El. 7 <foreign lang="greek">ὑψηλῶν δ’  ἐπὶ νηῶν τέθεικε σκῦλα πλεῖστα βαρβάρων</foreign>, with which compare <foreign lang="greek">παρεῖκεν</foreign>, the perfect of <foreign lang="greek">παρίημι</foreign>, in Hel. 1059. <foreign lang="greek">ἀφεικότα</foreign> occurs <bibl n="Dem. 37.1">Or. 37 &sect; 1</bibl>.
</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ἐξεστηκέναι</lemma> That he was out of his sober senses&mdash;not himself, as we say. [<foreign lang="greek">οὐκ ἐντὸς ὢν αὐτοῦ</foreign>, &sect;&sect; 20, 35, 49. Eur. Bacch. 359 <foreign lang="greek">μέμηνας ἤδη καὶ πρὶν ἐξέστης φρενῶν</foreign>. S.]</p>
<p>ibid. <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ἐκεῖνα</lemma> &lsquo;that other account.&rsquo;
</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">μηδὲν ἀποφηνάμενος</lemma> &lsquo;Without delivering judgment.&rsquo; In classical Greek, of course, <foreign lang="greek">οὐδὲν</foreign> would be required. Cf. <foreign lang="greek">ὅτι μὴ</foreign> inf. 39.&mdash;<foreign lang="greek">πέπομφε</foreign>, a rather rare perfect (Thuc. VII 12). Perhaps <foreign lang="greek">πεπόμφει</foreign>, or <foreign lang="greek">ἐπεπόμφει</foreign>, &lsquo;had sent.&rsquo; Otherwise we should expect the aorist. In this late Greek the Latin usage, which has one tense only for aorist and perfect, <hi rend="italic">misit,</hi> is perhaps incorrectly followed. See Winer's Grammar, p. 136 ed. Moulton. Cf. Or. 39, Arg. &sect; 2 <foreign lang="greek">τετελεύτηκεν</foreign>. [Mr F. H. Baynes defends this use of the perfect, regarding it as=<foreign lang="greek">πέπομφεν ἤδη</foreign>, i.e. the position of affairs now, at the moment of the delivery of the present speech, is this, that the arbitrator <hi rend="italic">has sent</hi> the case before the court.]
</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">τὴν εὐθεῖαν γίγνεται</lemma> It takes the course of an ordinary or regular action, <foreign lang="greek">εὐθυδικία</foreign>. The accusative here is strangely and irregularly used, and perhaps <foreign lang="greek">παρὰ</foreign> should be retained, &lsquo;according to the ordinary practice.&rsquo; In showing that a special plea cannot be urged in this case, Chrysippus, or his advocate, goes into all the facts, just as they would appear in a common trial.
</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ἐπισημαίνεται</lemma> &lsquo;Remarks&rsquo;; another late usage,&mdash;<foreign lang="greek">κατ’  ἀρχὰς</foreign>, see &sect; 4.&mdash;<foreign lang="greek">τὸ λέγειν</foreign>, &lsquo;the saying a man has done all the contract required him to do is no ground at all for pleading that the action cannot be brought.&rsquo; &lsquo;<title>That</title> (he says) is the plea of one who is defendant in an ordinary trial, and rebuts a charge brought against him; not the plea of <pb n="8"/> one who wants to show that there is no case against him at all.&rsquo; A <foreign lang="greek">παραγραφή</foreign>, in fact, turned solely on the <hi rend="italic">inadmissibility</hi> of a suit, e.g. on the ground that it belonged to another court or different jurisdiction. He quotes as a case of this in the next sentence, that contracts not made at or for a voyage to Athens could not be brought before an Athenian court.
</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">τετήρηται</lemma> &lsquo;The same peculiarity is observed here as in the speech against Neaera, viz. that it is not spoken by one party only; but whereas there the division is plain, here it is confused and obscure: it appears to me however&rsquo; (i.e. to the grammarian Libanius) &lsquo;that the second speech begins at <foreign lang="greek">ἀκούσας</foreign>, &amp;c (&sect; 21, where see note). Anyhow, it is clear that they are <hi rend="italic">partners</hi> who bring this action against Phormion.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Kennedy renders it, &lsquo;as we take our turns of addressing you,&rsquo;&mdash; apparently referring it to the two partners speaking in succession. But this appears a less likely meaning. [Kennedy's rendering was disapproved by Shilleto. Blass (<title>Att. Ber.</title> III i 578{2}) suggests that the view that the two partners spoke &lsquo;in turns&rsquo; may have partly arisen from a misunderstanding of <foreign lang="greek">ἐν τῷ μέρει</foreign>. If this phrase refers to successive speeches by the two partners, he would expect <foreign lang="greek">ἑκατέρου ἡμῶν</foreign>, rather than <foreign lang="greek">ἡμῶν</foreign>, or <foreign lang="greek">ἐν μέρει</foreign>, &lsquo;by turns.&rsquo; rather than <foreign lang="greek">ἐν τῷ μέρει</foreign>, &lsquo;in <hi rend="italic">our</hi> turn.&rsquo; He adds that <foreign lang="greek">ἐν μέρει</foreign>, &lsquo;in turn,&rsquo; occurs in Aesch. Eum. 198, 436, 586.

Cf. <bibl n="Dem. 35.18">Or. 35 &sect; 18</bibl> <foreign lang="greek">ἐδανείζοντο παρ’  ἡμῶν τὰς τριάκοντα μνᾶς, ὡς υπαρχούσης αὐτοῖς ὑποθήκης ἑτέρων τριάκοντα μνῶν</foreign>. Phormion borrowed 20 minae = 2000 drachmae, and should have put on board goods worth 4000 drachmae, this transaction leaving an ample margin for a bad market, or for actual losses. Mr Joseph Bickersteth Mayor (in <title>The Journal of Philology</title> VI p. 242) thinks the phrase means &lsquo;on a separate, distinct, independent security,&rsquo; and to this he refers <foreign lang="greek">οὔτε γὰρ τὴν ὑποθήκην παρέσχετο</foreign> (<foreign lang="greek">παρέσχεν</foreign>) in &sect; 7, and <foreign lang="greek">ὑποθήκην οὐκ ἔχων</foreign> in &sect; 22.

If the goods (of whatever amount) were the security, and (what is <pb n="13"/> nowhere expressly stated, though it seems probable) the ship itself also was pledged, the not bringing the ship back to the Peiraeus would be alluded to in &sect; 7. Kennedy follows Seager in rendering it &lsquo;on the security of the single cargo,&rsquo; i.e. the return cargo; but it does not appear how the Greek can mean this.</p>
<p>[Thalheim, <title>der Process des Chrysippos,</title> p. 59, explains it thus:  <quote lang="de">&lsquo;fur das Darlelin wird ausser der dafur zu beschaffenden Ladung <emph>eine weitere Ladung</emph> von 20m verpfandet&rsquo;</quote>; and M. Dareste renders it: &lsquo;avec affectation sur un chargement d'une valeur double&rsquo;; thereby coinciding with Mr Paley's view, which, however, says Shilleto, &lsquo;cannot be right.&rsquo; Mr Page suggests that the phrase is a technical term used when a borrower gives security equal in amount to the sum lent. On this view it is the difference between the sum lent and the goods purchased that constitutes the real security. Possibly the phrase should be altered into <foreign lang="greek">ἐπ’  ἐλευθέρᾳ ὑποθήκῃ</foreign>, &lsquo;or an unencumbered security&rsquo;; cf. <bibl n="Dem. 35.21">Or. 35 &sect; 21</bibl> <foreign lang="greek">ὑποτιθέασι ταῦτ’  ἐλεύθερα</foreign> and &sect; 22 <foreign lang="greek">έπ’  ἐλευθέροις τοῖς χρήμασι δανειζόμενοι</foreign>.

[The ordinary <hi rend="italic">gold</hi> stater weighed a double drachma of silver; and as, in the time of Menander, shortly after the date of this speech, the ratio of gold to silver had fallen from 13 1/3 to 10:1 (Pollux, ix 76), the value of this stater must have fallen to 20 dr.

<p>The text informs us that its value at Bosporus was 28 Attic drachmae. &ldquo;The weight of the Cyzicene stater is uniformly about 248 grains. As the Attic and Macedonian staters which weighed 133 grains were equivalent to 20 Attic drachmae, while the Cyzicene, weighing 248 grains, passed for no more than 28, it is evident that the silver alloy of the electrum of which those pieces are made was deducted and considered of no value, not being in fact worth the cost of extraction. Mr Burgon estimates the alloy of ancient electrum at about 1/4. Then as 133 is to 20, so is 3/4 of 248 or 186 to 28, exactly the equivalent in drachmae of the Cyzicene stater as given by Demosthenes.&rdquo; Leake's <title>Numismata Hellenica</title> (Asiatic Greece), p. 50.

<head><foreign lang="greek">ΠΡΟΣ ΤΗΝ ΛΑΚΡΙΤΟΥ ΠΑΡΑΓΡΑΦΗΝ</foreign>:  Androcles v. Lacritus.</head>
<div type="section" n="0">
	<p>THE speech against Lacritus affords another example of <foreign lang="greek">παραγραφὴ</foreign> or special plea in bar of action. Here, as in the preceding lawsuit, and indeed in that next following, the pleader in bar of action has spoken first, and Androcles, the real claimant, now follows, his object being to show that this is no case for a <foreign lang="greek">παραγραφή</foreign>.</p>
<p>The plaintiff had lent money on bottomry to Artemon, a merchant of Phaselis in Pamphylia. Lacritus, the defendant, also of Phaselis (&sect; 15), was Artemon's brother, and, being present at the transaction, had verbally (it seems) engaged to be responsible for the repayment. Artemon having died without discharging his debt to Androcles, Lacritus is sued, both as the inheritor of his brother's property, and as having pledged himself to see that the loan should be repaid.</p>
<p>Lacritus was a <title>Sophist,</title> one of the pupils of Isocrates. The plaintiff taunts him (much in the tone and style in which Aristophanes taunts the professors of wisdom in the &ldquo;Clouds,&rdquo;) with perverting his knowledge of right and wrong to evade the just claim now made upon him. Indeed, the prosecutor seems to rely somewhat on the general unpopularity of Sophists for getting a verdict in <pb n="53"/> his own favour (&sect; 41). The answer of Lacritus is, that Androcles cannot show any written proof or affidavit by which he has become legally liable for his brother's debt; and further, as he has given up the property, he is entitled to be discharged also from any debts upon it.</p>
<p>Two parties are concerned as principals on each side, viz.: Androcles of Athens and Nausicrates of Carystus (in Euboea) as lenders, and the brothers Artemon and Apollodorus<note anchored="yes"><p>[That Apollodorus (as well as Artemon) was a brother of Lacritus may be inferred from &sect; 8 <foreign lang="greek">τῶν ἀδελφῶν τῶν ἑαυτοῦ</foreign>, &sect; 15 <foreign lang="greek">οἱ ἀδελφοὶ οἱ τούτου</foreign>, and 42 <foreign lang="greek">τοὺς ἀδελφοὺς τοὺς αὑτοῦ</foreign>. Nevertheless, in &sect; 7 we have <foreign lang="greek">Ἀρτέμωνι τῷ τούτου ἀδελφῷ καὶ Ἀπολλοδώρῳ</foreign>, and in &sect;&sect; 3, 15, 36 Artemon alone is named as brother of Lacritus. Artemon is dead (3); and L. is described as his sole heir. It was formerly urged (by Blass, <title>Att. Ber.</title> III i 502{1}) that this would be impossible if Apollodorus also, who is apparently still alive, had been a brother of L. But it is highly probable that L. was <hi rend="italic">not</hi> the sole heir, and that Artemon and Apollodorus were both of them brothers of L. (Uhle, i pp. 8, 10). S.]</p></note>, of Phaselis, as borrowers<note anchored="yes"><p>Kennedy inclines to think that the action lay solely between Androcles and Lacritus, as the custom at Athens was to make contracts between parties both joint and several. See on &sect; 34.</p></note>. The conditions were, that they (the brothers) should sail with goods to Mende or Scione in the peninsula of Pallene (in Chalcidice), take in a specified number of jars of Thracian wine, thence sail to Bosporus (in the <title>Crimea</title>), and after selling the wine, return to Athens with a fresh cargo and so discharge the debt on the double voyage (<foreign lang="greek">ἀμφοτεροπλους</foreign>). The usual conditions were inserted in the contract, that the money should be paid liable only to certain drawbacks in the event of storms, wreck or leakage, capture by pirates, &amp;c. And the security offered was a cargo of wine to be taken in at Mende or Scione, the lenders having the right to take possession, on the return to Athens, of the return-cargo, until the loan should be paid.   <pb n="54"/></p>
<p>&ldquo;It is stated by Androcles, the speaker, that this agreement was violated in several ways by the borrowers; that they failed to ship the stipulated quantity of wine; that they took up a further loan upon the security given to himself and his partner; that they did not purchase a sufficient return-cargo; that, instead of entering into the regular port of Athens, they put into a creek used only by thieves or smugglers; and, when the creditors demanded their money, they and their brother Lacritus falsely represented that the vessel had been wrecked<note anchored="yes"><p>C. R. Kennedy.</p></note>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It does not seem clear that Lacritus was legally liable. All that he appears to have done was to have gone with his brothers, as a &ldquo;referee&rdquo; or guarantee for their respectability and solvency, to the money-lenders, and to have assured them that it was &ldquo;all right.&rdquo; Demosthenes (if indeed he is really the writer of this speech) is somewhat abusive in speaking of Lacritus, and it has been thought he had a personal dislike of or feeling of jealousy against Isocrates, the teacher of Lacritus (see &sect; 40). It is clear that the death of Artemon may have suggested to Androcles the attempt to make Lacritus personally liable, though at first he had trusted to Lacritus' character and credit, and to his influence with his brothers. His general abuse of the merchants of Phaselis (&sect; 1) implies vexation at a loss rather than consciousness of the justice of his cause.</p>
<p>The special plea put in by Lacritus turned, as usual, on a denial that the action was maintainable. He simply denied all complicity, and pleaded that, having resigned his brother's property, he could not be saddled with his debts. And there seems no reason to doubt that this was a fair and just defence.</p>
<p>Mr Penrose says &ldquo;This speech is of uncertain date&rdquo;;  <pb n="55"/> and there appears to be no safe criterion for forming any conclusion in any part of the oration. [But it may be noted (1) that Isocrates, the teacher of Lacritus, is referred to in terms implying that he is still actively engaged as a teacher of Rhetoric (&sect; 40), while Lacritus himself is already gathering pupils around him (&sect; 41). Hence the speech may belong to the later years of Isocrates, at any rate before his death in B.C. 338.&mdash;(2) We have an express allusion to the prompt settlement of commercial cases during the winter months, a reform probably due to the administration of Eubulus and later in date than 355 B.C., but fully established when the speech on Halonnesus (Or. 7) was delivered, B.C. 343&mdash;2. (See &sect; 46n.)&mdash;(3) The commercial relations of Athens, in particular the trade with the Euxine, with the islands of the Northern Aegean and the towns of Chalcidice (Mende and Scione), remain unbroken (&sect;&sect; 10, 35, &amp;c.). These considerations with others, stated in detail by Arnold Schaefer (<title>Dem. und seine Zeit</title> III B 290), point to the period preceding the outbreak of the last war with Philip (B.C. 340&mdash;338), and make it probable that the speech may be approximately placed in the year B.C. 341. M. Dareste (<title>Les plaidoyers civils de Dem.</title> I p. 316) suggests B.C. 345. Blass, <title>Att. Ber.</title> III i 503{1} = 564{2}, prefers placing it in 351, the year after the peace between Athens and Chalcidice. We do not know whether Mende and Scione belonged to the Chalcidic federation; but, if so, they must have been destroyed after the fall of Olynthus in 348. Cf.

Again, the piquant wit we here find, strikes us as unlike Demosthenes. Whether he would have spoken so disparagingly of Isocrates in &sect; 40 is difficult to decide; Benseler at any rate doubts it. The strongest objections, however, are the feebleness of the argument even in crucial points of the case, and the wasting of words over irrelevant details, as when (in &sect;&sect; 47&mdash;49) the jurisdiction of the Eleven, the first three Archons and the Generals is described at length, simply to prove that it is no part of their business to settle mercantile matters.&rsquo; For these reasons, A. Schaefer (<title>Dem. u. seine Zeit</title> III B 291) agrees with Fynes Clinton (<title>Fasti Hellenici</title> II 357) in thinking that the evidence preponderates against our ascribing the speech to Demosthenes. The same view is also taken by Blass (<title>Attische Beredsamkeit</title> III i 502&mdash;4{1}, 562&mdash;5{2}), who is led by considerations of style to ascribe the speech to the same writer as those against Macartatus (Or. 43) and Olympiodoius (Or. 48). It is also rejected by M. Dareste, I 316. S.]</p>
<p>Boeckh (<title>Publ. Econ.</title> I xxiii), in commenting at some length on this oration, expresses no doubt of its genuineness.

	<div type="section" n="0">
	<p>THIS is an important and rather difficult speech. As conveying much and curious information about mining operations and the laws which regulated them, it is unique in the writings of the orators, though Xenophon touches upon the subject, if the treatise <foreign lang="greek">περὶ πόρων</foreign>, &lsquo;on the Athenian Revenues,&rsquo; is rightly attributed to him. Dismissing for the present any discussion on this topic<note anchored="yes"><p>See note on p. 101.</p></note>, we shall endeavour to state the nature and grounds of the action as briefly and clearly as the somewhat complex and involved argument allows.</p>
<p>The plea is preferred by one Nicobulus for a <foreign lang="greek">παραγραφὴ</foreign> against certain unreasonable claims (as he considers them) made upon him by Pantaenetus, who is in effect the plaintiff. He had charged Nicobulus with damaging his works, with taking away ore and smelted silver from his slaves, with taking possession of the mine for non-payment of money advanced to him by Nicobulus in conjunction with Evergus, and with other outrages (&sect; 33). The case is made more intricate by the numerous transfers of the mining property (or &ldquo;sett,&rdquo; as it is now technically called) to various owners, who still retain a lien upon it. The successive proprietors of the mine were (1) Telemachus, &sect; 5; (2) Pantaenetus, &sect; 22; (3)  <pb n="99"/> Mnesicles, who holds the conveyance in his own name, as having lent money on security of it, &sect; 5; (4) Nicobulus and Evergus, who obtained the transfer direct from Mnesicles, as the mortgagee; (5) Pantaenetus again, but <hi rend="italic">under lease</hi> to the last-mentioned proprietors; (6) the nominees of Pantaenetus, who bought it at his urgent request from Nicobulus, &sect; 16.</p>
<p>To pay for the mine, and perhaps to carry on operations, Pantaenetus had at the outset borrowed money from Mnesicles (&sect; 4) and other parties. On this account, the mine is transferred to Mnesicles, who is thenceforth the real vendor, <foreign lang="greek">πρατήρ</foreign>. But, on Mnesicles requiring to be paid, Pantaenetus a second time borrows money, viz. from Nicobulus and Evergus, who consent to purchase the mine in their turn from Mnesicles, at the desire of the nominal owner Pantaenetus, on condition of getting their interest, in the form of rent, from the profits of the mine, of which he becomes the lessee under them, &sect; 5. At this juncture, of course, Nicobulus and Evergus are the real owners of the mine; but by a special clause, Pantaenetus has the power of redemption, or resuming actual ownership, within a certain time.</p>
<p>The transaction being concluded, Nicobulus goes abroad for a time, and during his absence Evergus, failing to obtain the promised rent as interest, takes possession on his own account, and apparently with undue rigour, of the mine, the slaves, and even of the ore raised. For this Pantaenetus eventually brings an action against him (probably on some technical ground of illegality<note anchored="yes"><p>Evergus ought to have acted, perhaps strictly in agreement with Nicobulus, or have waited for his return, or to have distrained only for the value of the mine. See on &sect; 5. and Arg. 50&mdash;4. He is said <foreign lang="greek">πλημμελεῖν</foreign>, &sect; 26.</p></note>), and obtains a verdict, with the heavy damages of two talents. (&sect; 46.)  <pb n="100"/></p>
<p>Nicobulus, on his return to Athens, is surprised to find Evergus in possession of the mine, he being still unpaid, and additional creditors against the mine, i.e. against Pantaenetus (whether real or fictitious), now coming forward. It is at length arranged that both Evergus and Nicobulus shall be paid their claims in full, and the mine shall pass into other hands. Nicobulus takes the precaution to get a release and discharge from all further demands on the part of Pantaenetus (i.e. as the former lessee), and this release is made the principal ground of the present <foreign lang="greek">παραγραφή</foreign>. Not so Evergus, however, who (as above mentioned) was prosecuted and condemned for the seizure of the property on his own account. It is clear that if he also had obtained an acquittance, Pantaenetus could have had no legal ground for the suit against him. An action is now brought against Nicobulus, who is the defendant in the suit. Pantaenetus says that he aided and abetted Evergus in getting wrongful possession of the property, and he seeks to obtain damages from him. But Nicobulus resists the claim, relying on the release he had got under the hand of Pantaenetus. Another point of the <foreign lang="greek">παραγραφὴ</foreign> is, that this is not properly a mining suit, and therefore cannot be tried among other <foreign lang="greek">δίκαι μεταλλικαί</foreign>. (&sect; 35&mdash;6.)</p>
<p>Pantaenetus makes an unfair use of the popular dislike of money-lenders. He urges this point in &sect; 52, <foreign lang="greek">μισοῦσιν Ἀθηναῖοι τοὺς δανείζοντας</foreign> and declares that Nicobulus is arrogant and personally offensive. But Nicobulus says he is not a professional money-lender who cares only for profit, but &ldquo;a private gentleman with capital at his disposal,&rdquo; who is willing to oblige his friends by a loan.</p>
<p>The chief difficulty, perhaps, lies in understanding how Pantaenetus contrived to get a verdict against Evergus; for it is clear that it is on the merits of this case, <pb n="101"/> and the success that had attended it, that the further action is filed against Nicobulus.</p>
<p>The late Mr Charles Rann Kennedy's Introduction should be in the hands of the student. As an eminent barrister, who was thoroughly versed in both the English and the Attic law, he has disentangled the case with great skill, though he considers it as still obscure on several points (<title>Demosthenes,</title> vol. IV 219&mdash;224).</p>
<p>The date of the speech is approximately determined by the mention in &sect; 6 of the Archonship of Theophilus, viz. B.C. 347. [The speech probably belongs to the year 345, A. Schaefer, <title>Dem. u. s. Zeit,</title> III B pp. 206, 332; Blass, <title>Att. Ber.</title> III i 420{1}, 478{2}. Both of these able critics accept it as a genuine work of Demosthenes. The contrary view is held by Sigg (<title>Jahrb. f. class. Philol. Suppl. Bd.</title> vi 401 n. 3) and G. Krueger, whose arguments have been refuted in detail by A Hoeck. S.]</p>
<p>On the Attic law of mines the student will find ample information in Kennedy's long and careful Introduction, p. 219&mdash;24 (in Vol. IV of his Translation of Demosthenes), and in Boeckh's <title>Dissertation</title> (1815) <title>on the silver mines of Laurion,</title> pp. 615&mdash;678 of the &ldquo;Public Economy,&rdquo; translated by Lewis, Ed. 2. [See also K. F. Hermann's <title>Privatalter.</title> p. 97 Blumner, and B&uuml;chsenschutz, <title>Besitz und Erwerb im Griechischen Alterthume,</title> pp. 98&mdash;103. There are monographs by Kordellas, <title>Le Laurion</title> (Marseille) 1871; Hansen, <title>de Metallis Atticis</title> (Hamburg) 1885, with a discussion of five inscriptions relating to the mines; and Binder, <title>Laurion, die attischen Bergwerke im Alterthum</title> (with a map and several plates), (Laibach) 1895. In the time of Strabo (fl. B.C. 24) the silver mines were nearly exhausted: p. 399 <foreign lang="greek">τὰ δ’  ἀργυρεῖα ἐν τῇ Ἀττικῇ κατ̓ ἀρχὰς μὲν ἦν ἀξιόλογα, νυνὶ δ̓ ἐκλείπει· καὶ δὴ καὶ οἱ ἐργαζόμενοι, τῆς μεταλλείας ἀσθενῶς ὑπακουούσης, τὴν παλαιὰν ἐκβολάδα</foreign> (unsmelted ores left by the old workers, the Cornish &lsquo;attle&rsquo;) <foreign lang="greek">καὶ σκωρίαν</foreign> (&lsquo;slag&rsquo;) <foreign lang="greek">ἁναχωνεύοντες, εὕρισκον έτι ἐξ αὐτῆς ἀποκαθαιρόμενον ἀργύριον, τῶν ἀρχαίων ἀπείρως καμινευόντων</foreign>. The right to work this refuse ore (as well as the slag) was from 1869 to 1873 one of the points in dispute between the Greek government and a commercial company, MM. Roux et Serpieri. An interesting account of the origin of <pb n="102"/> the quarrel, with some correspondence thereon, may be found in the <title>Times</title> for 9th, 10th, 12th and 16th Oct. 1872, and 10th Aug. 1875; and a lively description of a visit to the works of one of the Greek companies is given in Mahaffy's <title>Rambles and Studies in Greece,</title> c. 6, pp. 117&mdash;131{1}, pp. 146&mdash;154{3}. In April 1886, by the kindness of MM. Serpieri and Pellissier, Mr Sandys visited some of the more ancient portions of the extensive mines of the French company which sends its lead to Newcastle, and its zinc to Swansea and Antwerp.

Mnesicles therefore has the right of sale, and in fact does afterwards sell the property to Evergus and Nicobulus, the latter of whom (as we have seen) is the defendant, and is now maintaining his right to a <foreign lang="greek">παραγραφὴ</foreign> as against Pantaenetus.

<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ὁσον τόκον</lemma> They lease it on terms which would just pay the interest of the loan, a drachma per month for every mina lent, or 12 per cent. per annum. Thus, he adds, it was a nominal lease, being in fact merely a way of paying the usual interest.
</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">παρὰ</lemma> During or pending Nicobulus' absence at Athens Evergus becoming dissatisfied with Pantaenetus for not paying the interest (or rent) regularly, goes to the mine to take possession (cf. <bibl n="Dem. 33.6">Or. 33 &sect; 6</bibl> <foreign lang="greek">οἱ χρῆσται κατήπειγον αὐτὸν ἀπαιτοῦντες καὶ ἐνεβάτευον</foreign>).

<p>Boeckh, however (p. 638), thinks <foreign lang="greek">κέγχρος</foreign> was a kind of dross or efflorescence, consisting chiefly of glazed lead that was got rid of in the refining furnace, thence called <foreign lang="greek">κεγχρεών</foreign>.

<p><foreign lang="greek">&lt;&gt;ν τύφῃ τις</foreign>] From Ar. Vesp. 1079, where Xerxes is described as burning Athens to &lsquo;smoke out&rsquo; the citizens as if they were so many hornets,  <foreign lang="greek">τῷ καπνῷ τύφων ἅπασαν τὴν πόλιν καὶ πυρπολῶν</foreign>, it would seem that the misdemeanour here mentioned is either sending smoke into a neighbour's pit to retard or annoy his workmen, or stopping up the ventilation so as to cause bad air. In Mid. &sect; 167, we have mention of <foreign lang="greek">θυρώματα καὶ ξύλα εἰς τὰ ἔργα τὰ ἀργυρεῖα</foreign>, which may refer to doors such as might be blocked or fastened up in the mines. Boeckh, who has another reading before him (<foreign lang="greek">ἐὰν ὑφάψῃ τις</foreign>), says &ldquo;we might either understand the burning of the wood used for supporting the mine, or the setting fire to the ores, for the purpose of undermining the pillars which supported the overlying mass, after they had become infirm.&rdquo; <title>Publ. Econ.</title> (p. 672 Lewis (2)). But <foreign lang="greek">ὑφαψῃ</foreign> seems due to a conjectural correction of the false reading <foreign lang="greek">ὑφῇ</foreign> iu the Paris MS S. [In a Derbyshire mine iu 1833, a quarrel about the right of working a lode of lead ended in several miners being stifled <pb n="133"/> to death with lighted straw. Annual Register 1834, p. 296. S.]</p>
<p><foreign lang="greek">ὅπλα ἐπιφέρειν</foreign> can only mean the making an armed attack; and it is likely that &lsquo;claims&rsquo; were often made the subject of violent dispute. It cannot refer to the seizure of tools and instruments, as some appear to have thought (see Boeckh, <title>Dissert.</title> p. 667). [Among the customs of the Manor of Crich in Derbyshire is the following: &lsquo;No miner is to bring an unlawful weapon to the mines, and if it chance that a miner (or any other person whosoever) quarrels upon the mine and fights and draws blood upon the mine, he shall pay the sum of three shillings and fourpence before the sun set.&rsquo; Bainbridge's <title>Law of Mines and Minerals,</title> p. 569. Binder, <title>Laurion,</title> p. 45, suggests that the provision mentioned in the text was intended to prevent either an armed rising of the slaves employed in the mines, or an armed attack on the workmen. S.]</p>
<p><foreign lang="greek">ἐπικατατέμνειν</foreign>, like <foreign lang="greek">ἐπινέμεσθαι</foreign>, without much doubt refers to encroaching on the oreground or &lsquo;sett&rsquo; of another, <foreign lang="greek">μέτρον</foreign>. A similar word is <foreign lang="greek">ἐπικαταλλαγὴ</foreign> in Theophrast. Char. 30, <foreign lang="greek">αἰσχροκερδείας</foreign>. Xenophon (de Vectig. &sect; 27) contrasts <foreign lang="greek">τὰ κατατετμημένα</foreign> with <foreign lang="greek">ἄτμητα μέταλλα</foreign>, [Hyperid.

If it should appear they were not, then damages are to be paid (assessed by Mnesicles, who is to conduct the inquiry) for any loss of time or bodily hurt resulting from the torture.

<head><foreign lang="greek">ΠΡΟΣ ΒΟΙΩΤΟΝ ΠΕΡΙ ΤΟΥ ΟΝΟΜΑΤΟΣ</foreign>:  Mantitheus v. Boeotus de nomine.</head>
<div type="section" n="0">
	<p>THIS speech turns on a point involving some curious questions in the rights of citizenship. It is primarily this: whether two sons of the same father, both enrolled as citizens, have a legal right to the same name. The civil disabilities resulting from it are described in detail; and although such difficulties could hardly arise with us, who use a plurality of names, the Athenian custom of describing a person solely by one name, with the addition of that of his father and <hi rend="italic">deme</hi> (borough or parish), made it impossible, in such cases as appointment by lot to any office, to know, publicly at least, which of the two was intended. It is distinctly affirmed in &sect;&sect; 32 and 40, that no Athenian citizen ever called two sons of his own by the same name.</p>
<p>To remove this practical difficulty an action is brought by Mantitheus, the son of Mantias<note anchored="yes"><p>&ldquo;The peculiar system of the Romans enabled them to associate with the individual's name an intimation of his clan and his family. But the Greeks, without such help, endeavoured to make a single name indicate as much as possible concerning the individual's relationship. Thus a Mantias names his son Mantitheus, preserving one element of his name, and varying the remainder. This method was exceedingly common, as appears from the witness of epitaphs, such as <foreign lang="greek">Δημοφῶν Δημονίκου, Σωγένης Σωκράτους, Φιλοξενίδης Φιλοκράτους</foreign>, &amp;c.&mdash;Nor can it have been an accident that in Demosthenes' family there should be so many persons named from <foreign lang="greek">δῆμος</foreign>. The name Demosthenes was borne by his father, Demon by an uncle and a cousin, Demophon by an uncle, Demochares and Demomeles by several of his kinsmen. We trace in this the democratic and political bias of the family.&rdquo; Rev. E. L. Hicks in <title>Nineteenth Cent.</title> no. 61, pp. 391, 398.</p></note>, of the deme Thoricus,  <pb n="150"/> and of a daughter of Polyaratus (<bibl n="Dem. 40.24">Or. 40 &sect; 24</bibl>), against his half-brother, by name Boeotus. This man was the son of another woman, Plangon, who, though only the mistress of Mantias, was an Athenian citizen; and the citizenship descended to the progeny of <foreign lang="greek">ἀστοὶ</foreign> on both sides, even without the legal form of marriage<note anchored="yes"><p>Adoption, or recognition of parentage by the father, was however necessary. Mr Kennedy assumes that Mantias must subsequently have married Plangon: for he says, &ldquo;had she never been more than a concubine, her sons could not have had heritable rights&rdquo; (Introd. p. 253). That they did share in the property with Mantitheus, is clear; see &sect; 6, and <bibl n="Dem. 40.48">Or. 40 &sect; 48</bibl>. But it is not clear that this was not an arrangement effected by sufferance or compromise, rather than a positive legal right. The passage in <bibl n="Dem. 40.9">Or. 40 &sect; 9</bibl>, <foreign lang="greek">οὐδὲ τῆς μητρὸς τῆς ἐμῆς ἀποθανούσης ἠξίωσεν αὐτὴν εἰς τὴν οἰκίαν παρ’  έαυτὸν εἰσδέξασθαι</foreign>, seems nearly conclusive against Mantias having subsequently married her.</p></note>. It appears from the speech that Mantias had, either in reality or in pretence, felt some doubts about this Boeotus, and another brother called, after the mother's father, Pamphilus, being his sons by Plangon. Boeotus, however,&mdash; at what age is uncertain,&mdash;had been persuaded by his friends to represent himself as an injured man<note anchored="yes"><p>From &sect; 18 it seems likely that he had enlisted popular sympathy; and this may in some degree explain the probable result of the trial in his favour.</p></note>, and to insist on being recognised as the son of Mantias, and as entitled to the rights of citizenship. Mantias was reluctant, but an action was threatened to compel him. Unwilling, for some political reasons, to appear in a public trial, he endeavoured to settle the matter by <foreign lang="greek">πρόκλησις</foreign>, i.e. by proposing that Plangon should declare   <pb n="151"/> on oath before an arbitrator, whether Boeotus and Pamphilus were her sons by Mantias or not. She had assured him privately that if the oath on the affirmative were tendered to her, she would decline to take it; and it had been further arranged, that a sum of money should be paid to her for so declining it. She, however, had unexpectedly sworn that they <hi rend="italic">were</hi> her sons by Mantias; and thus Mantias was obliged to enter both sons in the clans (<foreign lang="greek">φρατρίαι</foreign> or &lsquo;families&rsquo;), according to the established rule of the <hi rend="italic">first</hi> enrolment or registration of citizens' children, which usually took place at an early age. It was then that the name of Boeotus was given to the elder, that of Pamphilus to the younger son. However, before the <hi rend="italic">second</hi> enrolment into the register of citizens (in the <foreign lang="greek">γραμματεῖον ληξιαρχικὸν</foreign>) had taken place, Mantias died. Boeotus then, dissatisfied with the name (which, though taken from his maternal uncle, he pretended had been given him in contempt<note anchored="yes">Compare the proverb <quote lang="greek">*boiwti/a u(=s</quote>, in Pind. Ol. VI 90.</note>), contrived to get himself registered as Mantitheus. The true Mantitheus resents this: he had, in filial obedience, recognised his half-brothers, taken them to live with him after his father's death, and acknowledged them as his co-heirs. But he insists on his sole right to the name of Mantitheus. Both in this and in the next speech, which is intimately connected with it, examples are given in which real inconvenience had resulted from the two having the same name.</p>
<p>It seems that Boeotus had founded his claim on his elder birth (<foreign lang="greek">ὡς δὴ πρεσβύτερος ὤν</foreign>, &sect; 27). Mantitheus does not affirm that he is himself older in years, but pleads that his registration in the phratry took place before that of Boeotus; and he contends that the precedence in being inscribed in the city register should be dated from that time.  <pb n="152"/></p>
<p>The precise age or period at which Boeotus procured his enrolment into his clan or phratry is not stated. It appears, however, that he was old enough to co-operate with (<foreign lang="greek">μεθ’  ἑαυτοῦ κατασκευάσαι</foreign>, &sect; 2) a party who undertook the management of the affair. At whatever age an adoption took place, the registration in a phratry was required (Ar. Ach. 146; cf. Ran. 418).</p>
<p>That the plaintiff Mantitheus lost his cause seems probable from Or. 40 &sect;&sect; 17, 18. It is there stated that Mantitheus brought an action against his brother by the name of Boeotus to recover the dower of his mother. This cause was given against Boeotus by the arbitrator; but he had denied that this was his name, and said that he was Mantitheus, not Boeotus<note anchored="yes"><p><foreign lang="greek">οὔτε ἠντεδίκει τότε παρὼν οὔτ’  ἔφη με καταδιαιτήσασθαι τὴν δίκην αὑτοῦ· οὐ γὰρ εἶναι Βοιωτὸν αὑτῷ ὄνομα, ἀλλὰ Μαντίθεον</foreign>. (<bibl n="Dem. 40.18">Or. 40 &sect; 18</bibl>.)</p></note>. This could not have been said,&mdash;unless in open contempt of court,&mdash;if he had been adjudged, in the present trial, to retain the name of Boeotus.</p>
<p>[Had the plaintiff gained his cause we may be quite sure that in his subsequent speech <foreign lang="greek">περὶ προικὸς</foreign> (Or. 40) he would have expressly asserted that it had been legally decided that the name of Mantitheus belonged to himself alone. Further, in the latter part of &sect; 18 of that speech, the suit <foreign lang="greek">περὶ προικὸς</foreign> is described as directed against the defendant under the name of Mantitheus<note anchored="yes"><p><bibl n="Dem. 40.18">Or. 40 &sect; 18</bibl> <foreign lang="greek">πάλιν τὴν αὐτὴν δίκην λαχὼν αὐτῷ Μαντιθέῳ...νῦν εἰς ὑμᾶς καταπέφευγα</foreign>.</p></note>. Hence Dionysius of Halicarnassus rightly calls the first speech <foreign lang="greek">πρὸς Βοιωτὸν ὑπὲρ τοῦ ὀνόματος</foreign> and the second <foreign lang="greek">πρὸς Μαντίθεον περὶ προικός</foreign><note anchored="yes"><p>Both speeches were carefully discussed by him in the lost portions of his treatise on Demosthenes. All that remains of that discussion may be found in his treatise on Deinarchus &sect;&sect; 11&mdash;13, where he combats on chronological grounds the notion that the speech <foreign lang="greek">περὶ τοῦ ὀνόματος</foreign> was written by the later Attic orator Deinarchus, and assigns it to the archonship of either Thessalus (Ol. 107, 2 = B.C. 351&mdash;0) or Apollodorus (Ol. 107, 3 = B.C. 350&mdash;49).

Blass assigns the speech to the year 348.</p></note>. It may be interesting to add that, in    <pb n="153"/> an inscription referring to a date shortly after B.C. 342, or at least eight years after the present trial, both the elder and the younger Mantitheus are mentioned with Pamphilus as heirs of Mantias.<note anchored="yes">The inscription (as restored by Boeckh, <title>Seewesen</title> Xd 4&mdash; 12; cf. p. 380 f.) is as follows:

Schaefer) or 348 (Weil and Blass). The trial probably took place in the autumn of that year.<note anchored="yes">A. Schaefer, u. s. pp. 214, 220.</note> S.]</p>
<p>[Modern critics have, with almost complete unanimity, accepted the speech as the genuine work of Demosthenes. It is unnecessary to cite the criticisms on the speech in general which may be found in the standard works of Arnold Schaefer and of Blass. It may, however, be interesting to quote the remarks made by Mr W. H. Kirk in his pamphlet on <title>Demosthenic Style in the Private Orations.</title> Beginning his investigation of the characteristics of the fourteen undoubtedly genuine private speeches, with examples of the vocabulary of denunciation, he observes that in the present speech and Or. 41 such examples are strikingly absent.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It would seem that in his youth (Or. 27 and 29) Demosthenes gave a freer rein to the passion which seeks issue in vigorous and downright abuse, while later (Or. 45) he learned to clothe the same sentiment in a more refined and subtle expression. The   <pb n="154"/> triumph of this refinement is seen in the first speech against Boeotus, where, without the employment of any harsh word, the adversary is loaded with scorn and rebuke. The cause lies in the <foreign lang="greek">ἠθοποιία</foreign> of the speech (the expression in the writer's style of the speaker's personality); Mantitheus, whose case has no support in law, wishes to arouse in the judges a sense of what is fair and considerate; accordingly, he poses throughout as a person of scrupulous fairness, and displays an ostentatious consideration of the rights and feelings of a brother whom he despises and repudiates, while admitting and satisfying his legal claims&rsquo; (p. 8).]</p>

But he had formed a connexion with one Plangon, an Attic citizen, from a passion he had conceived for her. She bore him two sons, who on attaining their full age went to law with Mantias, claiming to be recognised by him as their father. Mantias pleaded against the claim at first, but afterwards adopted the youths, as no other course remained to him in consequence of an offer of his own which he had made to Plangon, deceived by a solemn promise of hers.&rsquo;

	<p>THE parties in this suit are the same as in the preceding. The action now brought against the defendant is for a sum of money claimed out of the general property as due exclusively to Mantitheus, viz. a talent as the dower of his mother, to which he had a legal claim (&sect; 59). The dispute seems to have been an old one; for in &sect;&sect; 3 and 18 the plaintiff says that after a lapse of eleven years he has come into court, all attempts to settle the matter by arbitration having failed. The claim was evidently first made by Mantitheus soon after his father's death. He had recognised his two half-brothers as co-heirs, and was willing to let them take a third share each, though perhaps he was not legally bound to do this<note anchored="yes"><p>In <bibl n="Dem. 39.6">Or. 39 &sect; 6</bibl>, he says, <foreign lang="greek">συγκεχωρηκέναι τὸ τρίτον νείμασθαι μέρος</foreign>, as if it were a voluntary concession on his part. But in &sect; 13 of the present speech he says he acknowledged Boeotus and Pamphilus in obedience to the law, though they were not his brothers. From which we may infer, not, as Kennedy thinks, that Mantias must have married Plangon after the death of his first wife, but that the adoption by the father entitled them to a share in the property. Indeed, this is virtually asserted in Or. 39 &sect;&sect; 6, 20, 30. It appears likely that this would carry with it a legal claim (&sect; 59) to Plangon's property under the title of <foreign lang="greek">προῖκα</foreign>, or dowry.</p></note>. But he asserted his right to the talent over and above his own third part. Upon this Boeotus makes a counter-claim to the same sum, <foreign lang="greek">τὴν ἴσην προῖκα</foreign><note anchored="yes"><p>In &sect; 20 it is said that Plangon's dower was more than 100 minae. (See the note on &sect; 14.)</p></note>, due to himself from his   <pb n="196"/> mother Plangon (&sect; 14), and, as it seems, to some further property due from his father (&sect; 15). He thought, no doubt, that his brother would decline to risk an action for a still larger demand than that which he had himself made, and which might go against him; and in default of direct evidence, he trusted probably to vague, indirect, and purposely misleading inferences (<foreign lang="greek">παραγωγαί</foreign>, &sect; 21), to establish the allegation that Plangon had a fortune. This, however, is denied and disproved by counter-testimony by Mantitheus.</p>
<p>For the time being, the dispute seems to have been settled by the division of the bulk of Mantias' personal property, reserving only the slaves and the family house (<foreign lang="greek">οἰκία</foreign>), the former for the sake of evidence on either side, the latter for payment of the claims, whichever side should prove to have a right to them.</p>
<p>This agreement being made, the cross-suits appear to have at once commenced. Each claimed his mother's dower out of the residuary property. The case was referred to an arbitrator Solon (&sect; 16), who however died before the decision could be given, in consequence of the delays and evasions of Boeotus. The latter then brings a fresh action against Mantitheus, and Mantitheus renews his old claim against Boeotus, and by that name. There are grounds for believing<note anchored="yes"><p>See Introd. Or. 39 ad fin.</p></note> the man had established his right to the name of Mantitheus: anyhow, when the case went against him as Boeotus, he denied that this was his name and took no notice whatever of the decision (&sect;&sect; 17, 18). Consequently, the real Mantitheus is compelled to sue him again in the eleventh year, in the court. Boeotus, it would seem, had changed his claim for Plangon's dower to a demand for some other property, which is not specified<note anchored="yes"><p>&sect; 17 <foreign lang="greek">οὐ νῦν περὶ ἐκείνων εἴληχέ μοι δίκην οὐδεμίαν, ἀλλὰ περὶ ἄλλων τινῶν</foreign>. There is some obscurity on this point which is not fully cleared up in the course of the speech. Perhaps the arbitrators' decision in favour of Mantitheus had released him from the payment of Plangon's dower; and so it was thought unsafe to make precisely the same demand in a new action. From &sect; 3 <foreign lang="greek">ἕνεκα τῆς δίκης ταύτης</foreign>, it appears likely that some other claims were trumped up for the sake of furnishing the matter of a cross-suit.</p></note>; but his motive was the same, to   <pb n="197"/> cancel one demand by another, and he probably made that demand which he thought he could best establish on the slaves' evidence.</p>
<p>That Boeotus had played the bully for a long time, and made many vexatious claims on his brother, is clear from the evidence adduced. He had behaved so badly, in fact, that Mantitheus had been compelled to leave his own home. Many instances are given in which the old quarrel about the name had led to most disagreeable results and misunderstandings. In truth, throughout both the speeches the <hi rend="italic">animus</hi> manifested on both sides is as bad as possible. In &sect; 57 the plaintiff intimates that he had fears of being poisoned if he had continued to live in the same house. And he even takes pains to show that he did not believe the defendants were his father's sons at all. He regards the whole affair of the forced adoption as a scandalous fraud.</p>
<p>In one part of the present speech (&sect;&sect; 8&mdash;12) the orator repeats, with some slight addition to the details, the subject of the preceding action about the name. The argument against the present claim of Boeotus turns (&sect;&sect; 20&mdash;24) on the improbability of his mother's father, who died a debtor to the state, having left any money over and above, that could have come to Mantias after the confiscation of the property. On the other hand, it is shown (&sect;&sect; 24, 25) that Mantitheus' mother was a lady of property, the daughter of Polyaratus, and sister of the wife of Chabrias. Her first husband was a son of Cleon (&sect; 25), and it is argued that such a man <pb n="198"/> was not likely to have married a penniless wife. Her brothers too were men of wealth and honour who were not likely to have seen their sister wronged (&sect; 25).</p>
<p>[The present trial seems to have taken place in the eleventh year after the death of Mantias (&sect; 3), who according to the evidence of inscriptions (see note 1 on p. 153) was alive at the end of Ol. 105, 3 = B.C. 357. The earliest possible date for his death is Ol. 105, 4 = B.C. 356, which would give us Ol. 108, 2 = B.C. 347&mdash;6 as the probable date of the present trial. This conclusion is supported by other details minutely stated by Arnold Schaefer (<title>Dem. u. s. Zeit</title> III B 224), and coincides with a passage of Dionysius of Halicarnassus<note anchored="yes"><p>Dionys. (on Deinarchus, &sect; 13 p. 666, 1) <foreign lang="greek">πρὸς Μαντίθεον περὶ προικός· Πάντων ἐστὶν ἀνιαρότατον. οὗτος ἀκολουθεῖ τῷ προτέρῳ λόγῳ καὶ πολλὰ ἔχει κατὰ λέξιν ταὐτά, ἃ εἴη ἂν τοῦ αὐτοῦ ῥήτορος, ἔξω τῆς Δεινάρχου ἡλικίας. [καὶ γὰρ οὐ] πολλοῖς ἔτεσιν ὕστερον ἠγώνισται τὸν ἀγῶνα ὁ κατήγορος, ἀλλὰ δύο ἢ τρισίν, ὡς ἀκριβέστερον περὶ αὐτῶν ἐν τῇ Δημοσθένους γραφῇ δεδηλώκαμεν</foreign>. The restoration in brackets is due to Sauppe.&mdash; For a minor chronological point, see on &sect; 37.</p></note>, placing the trial <foreign lang="greek">περὶ προικὸς</foreign> <hi rend="italic">two or three</hi> years after the trial <foreign lang="greek">περὶ ὀνόματος</foreign>, which (according to Schaefer's view) belongs to B.C. 350. Blass, however, makes the interval of time shorter, placing the first speech in 348 and the second in 347. In the latter year Mytilene, after having been under the rule of Cammys (&sect; 36), entered as a free state into alliance with Athens. It was in the same year that Demosthenes was a member of the Council, and his engagements in that capacity would be a sufficient excuse for his declining to write a second speech on behalf of Mantitheus (<title>Att. Ber.</title> III i 510{2}).</p>
<p>Arnold Schaefer (<hi rend="italic">u. s.</hi> pp. 225&mdash;6) holds the present speech inferior to the speech <foreign lang="greek">περὶ ὀνόματος</foreign> both in grasp of subject-matter and in style and expression. The writer was clearly familiar with the earlier speech, and several closely parallel passages occur in the two orations, which  <pb n="199"/> are in some cases better expressed in the earlier speech (cf. <bibl n="Dem. 39.23">Or. 39 &sect; 23</bibl> with 40 &sect; 29; 39 &sect; 2 with 40 &sect; 9). For these and similar reasons he concludes that the <foreign lang="greek">περὶ προικὸς</foreign> was not written by Demosthenes. Having in the former case availed himself of the help of Demosthenes without success, the plaintiff may have resorted to another advocate in the latter. In frequency of hiatus and in absence of rhythm the speech is unlike the genuine work of Demosthenes. For these and other reasons, Blass agrees with Schaefer in regarding it as the work of another writer. <title>Att. Ber.</title> III i 453{1}, 511{2}. S.]</p>
<p>[The two speeches are noticed as follows by Von Wilamowitz-Moellendorff:&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Die vergleichung der demosthenischen rede 39 mit der eines unbekannten 40 ist sehr lehrreich. Demosthenes f&uuml;hrt eine schlechte sache und verliert sie, aber die rede ist sehr geschickt. Der andere sachwalter hat eine, wie es scheint, gute sache; den erfolg vermag ich nicht zu erkennen. Die sache war wol die. Der politiker Mantias von Thorikos hatte eine ehefrau Plangon, die er liebte, von der er kinder hatte, die er aber doch verstiess, als ihr verm&ouml;gen verloren gieng. Nun nahm er sich eine reiche wittwe und zeugte mit der einen andern sohn. Aber als diese starb, kehrte er zu der ersten liebe zuruck, wollte nur von den kindern der Plangon nichts wissen. Doch diese war geschickt genug, den alten in den letzten tagen zur gerechtigkeit zu bestimmen. Und der nunmehr geprellte angeblich einzig echtb&uuml;rtige sohn dang sich vergebens den besten redner f&uuml;r seine h&auml;ssliche sache und ist mit einem schlechtern redner fur eine anscheinend begr&uuml;ndete geldforderung kaum besser gefahren.&rsquo; <title>Aristoteles u. Athen,</title> II 179 (Das Recht am Namen), n. 24.</p>
<p>The style of the present speech is characterised as follows by Mr W. H. Kirk:&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;The speech displays neither strength of passion nor marked force of reasoning; its lax structure is reflected in the comparative weakness of deictic expressions, the proportion of which is about the same as in Or. 39. The lack of the apostrophe it has in common with Or. 27 and Or. 30; but how far it is from possessing the compact energy of these speeches appears by the almost com<pb n="200"/> plete absence of asyndeton, of which only two feeble examples occur (&sect;&sect; 21, 47). The want of that dramatic force which this figure often gives is further emphasized by the fact that we find neither the challenge, the suggestion, nor the rhetorical answer; in short, none of those abrupt and telling checks to the flow of speech by which Demosthenes at once fixes and reposes the attention. The rhetorical value of asyndeton could hardly be better illustrated tban from this drowsy stream of constant polysyndeton... That the writer was a student of Demosthenes is suggested not only by the borrowings from the first speecb against Boeotus, but also by the opening words of the pro&oelig;mium, which recall those of Or. 55, but lack their neatness and charm... The touches of insinuation in &sect;&sect; 8, 23, and the air of moral superiority in &sect;&sect; 12, 48&mdash;49, are sufficiently in the tone of the preceding speech to show that the writer wished to preserve to Mantitheus the attitude in which Demosthenes had placed him; but he lacked the ironic power by which the latter made this reserve appear the restraint imposed by a sense of right and decorum on a proud and energetic temperament.&rsquo; <title>Demosthenic Style in the Private Orations,</title> p. 40 f.]</p>

The question mainly turns on the fact of either or both having brought a dower. Mantitheus, when the property was being shared, claimed his mother's money over and above his share. It is clear that he regarded Boeotus' demand as a mere device for cancelling his account against the common property.</p>

	<div type="section" n="0">
	<p>THIS action relates, like that against Phormion, to a loan on bottomry, and the non-fulfilment of a contract. The case is plain, and involves no serious difficulties, either in the legal points or in the argument; but the speech is one of considerable value as illustrating the nature of the corn-trade at Athens, and the regulations by which it was controlled<note anchored="yes"><p>See Introd. to Or. 34, p. 1.</p></note>. Why it is named an action for <hi rend="italic">damage</hi> in most of the MSS is not so clear. The action was, in fact, to enforce the payment, with interest, of a loan, which was repudiated on the plea of injury to the ship. But, as the ship was the security for the money, and it had not been produced for the mortgagees, we may suppose that <foreign lang="greek">βλάβη</foreign> means &lsquo;loss&rsquo; in respect of this part of the contract<note anchored="yes"><p>[<foreign lang="greek">βλάβης</foreign> is omitted in MSS S and A, and by Harpocration s. v. <foreign lang="greek">ἀμφοτερόπλουν</foreign>. S.]</p></note>. According to Mr Kennedy<note anchored="yes"><p>Dem. Append. IX p. 389.</p></note>, any action at the suit of the party injured was a <foreign lang="greek">δίκη βλάβης</foreign>. And as the injury in this case was a wrong done <hi rend="italic">ex delicto,</hi> and not merely a breach of obligation <hi rend="italic">ex contractu,</hi> it is entitled <foreign lang="greek">κατὰ Διονυσοδώρου</foreign> and not <foreign lang="greek">πρὸς Διονυσόδωρον</foreign><note anchored="yes"><p>ib. p. 373.</p></note>.</p>
<p>Darius and Pamphilus had lent to Dionysodorus 3000 drachms, to enable him to engage in the corn-trade between Athens and Egypt. The loan was to be repaid, with interest, on the return to Athens (<foreign lang="greek">ἀμφοτερόπλους</foreign>,     <pb n="247"/> &sect; 6), and clauses were inserted binding the borrowers to trade only between Athens and Egypt (&sect;&sect; 6, 42) and to give up the ship on their return, as security for the payment, under penalty of twice the whole amount due (&sect; 45). They were to have the use of the money for one year, and had no right to extend the time (&sect;&sect; 3, 45).</p>
<p>Dionysodorus had a partner Parmeniscus, who sailed with the ship to purchase corn in Egypt. Both of them appear to have been in collusion with Cleomenes (<foreign lang="greek">τοῦ ἐν τῇ Αἰγύπτῳ ἄρξαντος</foreign>, &sect; 7) and had a joint interest in keeping up the price of corn. The agents at Athens used to send advices to those in Egypt, and when corn became cheaper at home through the arrival of cargoes from Sicily or the Pontus, the buyers in Egypt used to send the corn to some other market where it was dearer. It was with this fraudulent intention, which was illegal (&sect; 3), that the defendants pretended their ship had sprung a leak, and were compelled to put in to Rhodes and unlade the corn, which they also sold there on finding it would fetch a higher price than at Athens (&sect; 10).</p>
<p>Dionysodorus, who had remained at Athens, was asked by the money-lenders for an explanation of this affair; they did not like to incur the suspicion of being in collusion with Cleomenes (&sect; 11) and they required the production of the ship. The defendants upon this make an offer to pay the principal and part of the interest, viz. so much of it as was due for the outer voyage and the return voyage as far as Rhodes, on condition of the bond being cancelled, and with it all further obligation (&sect; 14). This the plaintiffs decline to do, alleging that if the ship was really wrecked, or in any way seriously disabled, they were bound to submit to the loss; if not, they were entitled to recover the whole sum. And that the ship was not lost is proved by the fact that the defendants afterwards traded with it between Rhodes and Egypt, <pb n="248"/> and that it was even now making voyages (&sect; 23). If, the plaintiffs argue, the ship had really sprung a leak, the defendants, had they acted honestly, would have brought the ship back to Athens when it had been repaired (&sect; 40). For all these reasons the conduct of the defendants is denounced as fraudulent and illegal. The offer of partial payment, the plaintiffs say, was made by the defendants with the conviction that it would be refused, <foreign lang="greek">διὰ τὰς ὑπούσας αἰτίας</foreign> (&sect; 13).</p>
<p>The suit was one of those called <foreign lang="greek">ἐμπορικαί</foreign>, and the plaintiffs press for a verdict in their favour, not only in their own interest, but in that of the whole mercantile community (&sect; 48). The indignation of the jury is raised by the hint that the defendants are in collusion with Cleomenes. It seems probable that the cause of the scarcity of corn<note anchored="yes"><p>See Introduction to Or. 34, <hi rend="italic">ad fin.</hi></p></note> was popularly attributed to this man's cupidity, and the date of the speech may be approximately fixed by the allusion (&sect; 8) to the high prices in the years 330&mdash;326 B.C., and probably to the end of that period, as prices are said to be falling (&sect; 9).</p>
<p>[In Fynes-Clinton's <title>Fasti Hellenici,</title> the speech is approximately assigned to B.C. 329: not before B.C. 331, because the facts occurred <foreign lang="greek">Κλεομένους ἐν τῇ Αἰγύπτῳ ἄρξαντος</foreign> (&sect; 7). Cleomenes was appointed praefect of Egypt by Alexander, B.C. 331 (Arrian III 5, Dexippus apud Phot. Cod. 82 = p. 200). He was charged with the building of Alexandria (Aristot. Oeconom. II 33); <title>vectigalibus Africae Aegyptique praepositus</title> (Curtius IV 8, 5). He remained in office till he was put to death by Ptolemy, B.C. 323 (Pausan. I 6, 3).</p>
<p>Arnold Schaefer holds that the aorist participle in &sect; 7 (<foreign lang="greek">ἦσαν ὑπηρέται...Κλεομένους τοῦ ἐν τῇ Αἰγύπτῳ ἄρ-</foreign>  <pb n="249"/> <foreign lang="greek">ξαντος</foreign>) shows that the <foreign lang="greek">ἀρχὴ</foreign> of Cleomenes was at an end when the speech was delivered, and he proposes to assign it to the winter of B.C. 322&mdash;321, i.e. some few months after the death of Demosthenes; who therefore, he concludes, could not have written the oration. The argument from <foreign lang="greek">ἄρξαντος</foreign> does not appear conclusive, as the aorist need only imply that Cleomenes <hi rend="italic">was in power at the time</hi> of the transaction described, without showing whether he was still in office or not when the speech was delivered. But, of course, if he were still in office, the most natural tense would have been the present.</p>
<p>Blass, <title>Att, Ber.</title> III i 584{2}, places the speech in the winter of B.C. 323&mdash;322{1}, not because the death of Demosthenes falls in October 322, but because that date marks the downfall of the Athenian democracy; a change which would have found some recognition in the speech itself. On the contrary we have a direct reference to the <title>Demos</title> in the words <foreign lang="greek">οὔτε γὰρ τῷ πλήθει τῷ ὑμετέρῳ συμφέρει τοῦτο</foreign> (&sect; 50).</p>
<p>The Z&uuml;rich editors, while refraining from deciding against the genuineness of the speech, admit that they have doubts on the subject, though they assign no specific reasons<note anchored="yes"><p>So also Schwarze, <title>De orat.</title> <foreign lang="greek">κατὰ Δ.</foreign> (G&ouml;ttingen, 1870) p. 18 f.</p></note>.</p>
<p>It closes with an appeal to Demosthenes (<foreign lang="greek">ἀξιῶ δὲ καὶ τῶν φίλων μοί τινα συνειπεῖν. δεῦρο, Δημόσθενες</foreign>). A. Schaefer suggests that some early transcriber may have added the name to enhance the value of a spurious oration; but it may be remarked that a transcriber with such an object in view is little likely to have added a clause, which might lead an ordinary reader to suppose at first sight that, as the speaker appeals to   <pb n="250"/> Demosthenes, the speech was <hi rend="italic">not</hi> written by that orator. If the last clause is genuine, it proves at any rate that the speech was delivered before the death of Demosthenes, and (as Schaefer candidly confesses) it is not <hi rend="italic">per se</hi> inconsistent with his having himself composed the speech. He is inclined to ascribe it to the same writer as the speeches against Apaturius (33) and Phormion (34). Blass agrees in regarding the speech as spurious; and there is an elaborate dissertation by P. Uhle, arguing that the writer was the same as that of the speech against Phormion, but different from that of the speech against Apaturius. It is accepted as genuine by Weil, <hi rend="italic">les Harangues de D&eacute;m.</hi> p. xiii, ed. 1881. S.]</p>
<p>Mr Mayor (<title>Journal of Philology,</title> VI, p. 251), remarking on the awkward sentence in &sect; 10, says, &lsquo;This seems to be more unlike Demosthenes than anything in the <title>Lacritus.</title> There are many minor points beside which make me doubt the genuineness of this speech.&rsquo; [Mr Kirk considers that it &lsquo;perhaps comes nearer to the Demosthenic type&rsquo; than any of the suspected private orations.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Denunciation is very slight, being in fact confined to the one word <foreign lang="greek">ἀναίσχυντος</foreign> (&sect; 41); but this is uttered with much sharpness of emphasis. Anaphora occurs once (&sect; 10), epanadiplosis once (&sect; 38). Interrogation is abundant, with three instances of the suggestion (&sect;&sect; 2, 27, 38) and three of the challenge (&sect; 39 <hi rend="italic">bis,</hi> &sect; 40); and there is an example of the rhetorical answer, &sect; 28. Asyndeton is quite frequent, and apostrophe is freely and effectively used; compare the rapid turning from the adversary to the judge and again to the adversary in &sect; 25, the argument rising into emphatic assertion, &sect;&sect; 26&mdash;8, and into denunciation, &sect;&sect; 40&mdash;2, the tone of challenge imparted to the argument in &sect; 32 and &sect; 39, and the vigorous insistence of &sect; 38. There are, however, other phenomena which, if the genuineness of the speech had to be decided on stylistic grounds, would tend to cast doubt upon it. The proportion of deictic expressions (2.0) is no higher than in Or. 55 <pb n="251"/> (<title>Callicles</title>), and the preponderance of <foreign lang="greek">μὲν οὖν</foreign> over <foreign lang="greek">τοίνυν</foreign> (6 : 2) is not Demosthenic. The lengthy prooemium contains much general reflection in &sect;&sect; 1&mdash;2, and a long anticipation of the narrative in &sect;&sect; 3&mdash;4; in this, as in the whole speech, we miss the compact structure and pointed conciseness of the genuine orations. Despite the employment of vivid figures, there is rarely any vivid sharpness and curtness; the livelier forms of question are dulled by length of phrase; and the asyndeton in &sect; 45, which might fairly be called cumulative, lacks, by reason of the same lengthiness, all the rapidity and weight that should belong to this figure. On the whole, asyndeton is employed (&sect;&sect; 7, 21, 22, 23, 27, 36, 37, 40, 46) rather for deliberate emphasis than in any warm or quick tone, though there is force in the rhetorical answer and in <foreign lang="greek">θεάσασθε</foreign>, &sect; 40. Irony is found in &sect; 40 (<foreign lang="greek">ὦ βέλτιστε</foreign>) and &sect; 41 (<foreign lang="greek">οὕτως ἀνδρεῖος</foreign>), in the latter case passing immediately into denunciation; but these are slight instances, and the scornful familiarity of the vocative has less propriety here than in 36 &sect; 52, where it is justified by the intimacy of the two enemies and by the tone of lofty rebuke which pervades that passage. In short, the excellences of Or. 56 are not superlative; the writer is master of his art so far as it was to be learned, while lacking the power and subtlety of expression which only high artistic endowment could give.&rsquo; <title>Demosthenic Style in the Private Orations,</title> p. 42.]</p>

<p>[<foreign lang="greek">ἀκαριαῖος</foreign>, proposed by Bekker, is supposed to mean &lsquo;short,&rsquo; and it has been suggested that the voyage from Rhodes to Egypt may fairly be described as &lsquo;short&rsquo; compared with a voyage from Egypt to Athens. But in direct distance it is as 370 miles is to 590; and it took at least four days, Diodorus III 34. Hesychius has <foreign lang="greek">ἀκαριαῖον· τὸ βραχύ, τὸ ὀλίγον</foreign>, and <foreign lang="greek">ἀκαριαία ῥιπή</foreign> (corrected into <foreign lang="greek">ῥοπή</foreign> by Salmasius) <foreign lang="greek">ὀλίγη, μικρά</foreign>.

<p><foreign lang="greek">ἀκέραιος</foreign>, the manuscript reading, ordinarily means &lsquo;unmixed,&rsquo; &lsquo;pure,&rsquo; Eur.

But a word which primarily means &lsquo;uninjured,&rsquo; &lsquo;intact,&rsquo; cannot be made to mean &lsquo;capable of being performed any number of times.&rsquo; A chess-problem (as Mr Page notices) may be started &lsquo;afresh&rsquo; (<foreign lang="greek">ἐξ ἀκεραίου</foreign>) as often as you please, and, each time you replace the pieces in their original position, the problem may perhaps be called <foreign lang="greek">ἀκέραιος</foreign>, but it does not follow that <foreign lang="greek">ἀκέραιος</foreign> means that it &lsquo;can be attempted again and again.&rsquo; The voyage (he adds) took place when winter was near, and it was at the same season that the ship in which St Paul sailed from Alexandria was stopped from further progress in a westerly direction owing to N.E. gales at Cnidus. He accordingly suggests that the phrase <foreign lang="greek">ἀκέραιος ὁ πλοῦς</foreign> means that, as compared with the voyage across the Aegean, which at that season was obstructed and difficult, the voyage to Egypt was &lsquo;open,&rsquo; &lsquo;intact,&rsquo; &lsquo;not interfered with.&rsquo; The choice seems to lie between this last interpretation and an emendation, such as <foreign lang="greek">ἀεὶ ὡραῖος</foreign>, suggested in the critical note.
