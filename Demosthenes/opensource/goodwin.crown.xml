<div type="secgroup" n="1-8">
<p>The solemn earnestness with which Demosthenes undertook this vindication of his whole political life is shown by the unusual and impressive prayer with which he begins, and still more by its repetition. He shows the same spirit in the appeal to the Gods in <bibl n="Dem. 18.141">&sect; 141</bibl>, with which he introduces his account of the fatal events which led to Chaeronea, and in his peroration (<bibl n="Dem. 18.324">&sect; 324</bibl>).
</p>
<div type="section" n="1">
<p>1. <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">τοῖς θεοῖς πᾶσι καὶ πάσαις</lemma>, <gloss>to all the Gods and Goddesses.</gloss> <foreign lang="greek">Θεός</foreign> is Goddess as well as God, <foreign lang="greek">θεά</foreign> being poetic; thus <foreign lang="greek">ἡ θεός</foreign> is the common title of Athena. A slight extension of the solemn formula <foreign lang="greek">πᾶσι καὶ πάσαις</foreign> becomes absurdly comic in <bibl n="Aristoph. Birds 866">Ar. Av. 866</bibl> <foreign lang="greek">εὔχεσθε ὄρνισιν Ὀλυμπίοις καὶ Ὀλυμπίῃσι πᾶσι καὶ πάσῃσιν</foreign>.
</p>
<p>2. <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">εὔνοιαν</lemma>: <foreign lang="greek">εὔνοια</foreign> may mean <gloss>de- votion</gloss> based on any superiority or merit, including <gloss>loyalty</gloss> of a subject to a prince or of a servant to his master (even of a dog to his mistress), <gloss>devotion</gloss> to a benefactor, and even enthusiasm for the success of a contestant in the games (though felt by a stranger). Here it means a good citizen's loyal <gloss>devotion</gloss> to the state.
</p>
<p>See Jackson's note on <foreign lang="greek">εὔνοια</foreign> in Trans. of Cambr. Philol. Soc. II. p. 115, where he explains the word in Arist. Pol. I. 6 (1255.a, 17) as &ldquo;loyalty, i.e. the willing obedience which an inferior renders to a kind and considerate superior.&rdquo; He refers especially to Arist. Eth. IX. 5, &sect;&sect; 3, 4 (1167.a, 18), <foreign lang="greek">ὅλως δ̓ εὔνοια δἰ ἀρετὴν καὶ ἐπιείκειάν τινα γίνεται, ὅταν τῳ φανῇ καλός τις ἢ ἀνδρεῖος ἤ τι τοιοῦτον. ἔχων διατελῶ</foreign>: <foreign lang="greek">ἀντὶ τοῦ ἀεὶ ἔχω, Ἀττικῶς</foreign>. Schol. (See <bibl n="Goodwin syntax 879">M.T. 879</bibl>.) The words <foreign lang="greek">ἔχων διατελεῖ</foreign> with <foreign lang="greek">εὔνοια</foreign> probably occurred in Ctesiphon's decree. Aeschines (III. 49) quotes from the decree <foreign lang="greek">ὅτι διατελεῖ καὶ λέγων καὶ πράττων</foreign>: see the spurious indictment (below) <bibl n="Dem. 18.54">&sect; 54</bibl>.10, and <bibl n="Dem. 18.57">&sect; 57</bibl>.2-3.
</p>
<p>3. <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ὑπάρξαι μοι</lemma>, <gloss>be granted me</gloss> (<gloss>be made available to me</gloss>). The fundamental idea of <foreign lang="greek">ὑπάρχω</foreign> in this sense is best seen in <foreign lang="greek">τὰ ὑπάρχοντα</foreign>, <gloss>the resources</gloss> or <gloss>the existing conditions</gloss>, i.e. <gloss>what is available</gloss>, <gloss>what one has to depend on</gloss>: see note on <foreign lang="greek">ὑπάρχειν</foreign> <bibl n="Dem. 18.95">&sect; 95</bibl>.5, and <foreign lang="greek">βέλτιστον ὑπάρχει</foreign>, IX. 5.
</p>
<p>4. <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ἀγῶνα</lemma>: see note on <foreign lang="greek">ἀγωνίζομαι,  3.3.ἔπειθ̓</foreign>, <gloss>secondly</gloss>: simple <foreign lang="greek">ἔπειτα</foreign> (without <foreign lang="greek">δέ</foreign>) is the regular rhetorical <pb n="2"/> formula after <foreign lang="greek">πρῶτον μέν</foreign> (see &sect;<bibl n="Dem. 18.8">&sect; 8</bibl>, 18, 177, 235, 248: cf. 267). Thucydides generally has this, but often <foreign lang="greek">ἔπειτα δέ</foreign>.
</p>
<p>5. <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ὅπερ ἐστὶ</lemma>: sc. <foreign lang="greek">εὔχομαι</foreign>, refer- ring to the whole sentence <foreign lang="greek">ὅπερ... ἀκροάσασθαι</foreign>. The relation of <foreign lang="greek">ὅπερ</foreign> to <foreign lang="greek">τοῦτο</foreign> here is clearly that of <foreign lang="greek">ὅ τι</foreign> (<bibl n="Dem. 18.8">&sect; 8</bibl>.6) to the following <foreign lang="greek">τοῦτο.ἐστὶ μάλισθ̓ ὑπὲρ ὑμῶν</foreign>, <gloss>concerns you especially</gloss> (more than myself).
</p>
<p>6. <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">εὐσεβείας</lemma>: referring to the oath (<bibl n="Dem. 18.2">&sect; 2</bibl>). Greek <foreign lang="greek">εὐσέβεια</foreign> reached a lower level than our <gloss>piety</gloss>, including negative abstinence from impiety, so that one who does not break his oath is so far <foreign lang="greek">εὐσεβής.τοῦτο παραστῆσαι ὑμῖν</foreign>, <gloss>may put this into your hearts</gloss>: <foreign lang="greek">τοῦτο</foreign> refers back emphatically to the omitted antecedent of <foreign lang="greek">ὅπερ</foreign>, as <foreign lang="greek">οὕτως</foreign> (<bibl n="Dem. 18.2">&sect; 2</bibl>.7) to that of <foreign lang="greek">ὡς</foreign>, and is explained by <foreign lang="greek">μὴ τὸν ἀντίδικον κ.τ.λ.</foreign>
</p>
<p>8. <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">τοῦ πῶς...δεῖ</lemma>: explained by <foreign lang="greek">τὸ καὶ...χρήσασθαι</foreign> (end of <bibl n="Dem. 18.2">&sect; 2</bibl>): cf. <foreign lang="greek">περὶ τοῦ ὅντινα τρόπον χρὴ ζῆν</foreign>, Plat. Rep. 352 D.
</p></div>
<div type="section" n="2">
<p>1. <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">τὸν ὅρκον</lemma>: the Heliastic oath, which each judge had sworn. The document in XXIV. 149&mdash;151 purporting to be this famous oath (hardly authentic) has this clause: <foreign lang="greek">καὶ ἀκροάσομαι τοῦ κατηγόρου καὶ τοῦ ἀπολογουμένου ὁμοίως ἀμφοῖν</foreign>. For the connection of the laws with the oath, see note on <bibl n="Dem. 18.6">&sect; 6</bibl>.5.
</p>
<p>2. <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">δικαίοις</lemma>, <gloss>just provisions.</gloss>
</p>
<p>3. <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ἀκροάσασθαι</lemma>: this (<foreign lang="greek">Σ</foreign>) or <foreign lang="greek">ἀκρο- ᾶσθαι</foreign> (L) is far preferable to the emendation <foreign lang="greek">ἀκροάσεσθαι</foreign>, the fut. infin. being exceptional with <foreign lang="greek">τό</foreign>. The infin. with <foreign lang="greek">τό</foreign> here denotes simply <gloss>the provision for hearing both sides impartially</gloss> and is not in oratio obliqua (<bibl n="Goodwin syntax 96">M.T. 96</bibl>, <bibl n="Goodwin syntax 111">111</bibl>).
</p>
<p>4. <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">τὸ μὴ προκατεγνωκέναι</lemma>: <gloss>not having decided against</gloss> (<foreign lang="greek">κατά</foreign>) <gloss>either party in advance</gloss>, the perf. expressing completion (<bibl n="Goodwin syntax 109">M.T. 109</bibl>): <foreign lang="greek">τὸ μὴ προκαταγνῶναι</foreign> would be timeless, like <foreign lang="greek">τὸ ἀκροάσασθαι</foreign> (above) and <foreign lang="greek">τὸ ἀποδοῦναι</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">τὸ ἐᾶσαι</foreign> (below).&mdash;<lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">οὐδὲ</lemma> (sc. <foreign lang="greek">μόνον</foreign>), <gloss>nor only</gloss> (cf. <bibl n="Dem. 18.93">&sect; 93</bibl>.1, 2).
</p>
<p>5. <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ἴσην</lemma> (pred.), <gloss>in equal measure.</gloss> &mdash;<lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">καὶ τῇ τάξει...χρήσασθαι</lemma>, i.e. <gloss>to allow everyone to adopt not only</gloss> (<foreign lang="greek">καὶ</foreign>) <gloss>that order of argument but also</gloss> (<foreign lang="greek">καὶ</foreign>) <gloss>that general plan of defence which</gloss> etc.
</p>
<p>6. <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ἀπολογίᾳ</lemma> refers strictly to the defence, which alone remained.&mdash;<lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ὡς... ἕκαστος</lemma>: <foreign lang="greek">ἕκαστος</foreign> is made subject of the relative clause, as this precedes; we reverse the order, and translate it with <foreign lang="greek">χρήσασθαι.τῶν ἀγωνιζομένων ἕκαστος</foreign> (not <foreign lang="greek">ἑκάτερος</foreign>), acc. to Weil, is &ldquo;tout homme qui plaide sa <pb n="3"/> cause,&rdquo; a general expression. He remarks that <foreign lang="greek">ἀγωνίζομαι</foreign> applies especially to the defendant.
</p>
<p>This is a dignified appeal against the offensive demand of Aeschines (III. 202), that the court should either refuse to hear Demosthenes or (at least) compel him to follow his adversary's order of argument. Both parties could not be heard impartially if one were compelled <gloss>by the court itself</gloss> to present his case in the most damaging order at his opponent's dictation.
</p></div>
<div type="section" n="3">
<p>1. <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">πολλὰ</lemma>: sc. <foreign lang="greek">ἐλαττώματα</foreign>.
</p>
<p>2. <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">καὶ μεγάλα</lemma>, <gloss>even serious.</gloss>
</p>
<p>3. <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ἀγωνίζομαι</lemma>, like <foreign lang="greek">ἀγών</foreign>, used of contests of all kinds, here of a lawsuit. See the pun on the two meanings of <foreign lang="greek">ἀγωνίσασθαι περὶ θανάτου</foreign> in IV. 47.
</p>
<p>4. <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">διαμαρτεῖν</lemma>, <gloss>to forfeit</gloss>: cf. <foreign lang="greek">ἀπο- στερεῖσθαι</foreign>, <bibl n="Dem. 18.5">&sect; 5</bibl>.4, and the following words.
</p>
<p>5. <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">μὴ ἑλεῖν τὴν γραφὴν</lemma>, <gloss>not to gain his case</gloss>: cf. <foreign lang="greek">Ὀλύμπια νικᾶν</foreign>, Thuc. I. 126; <foreign lang="greek">ψήφισμα νικᾷ</foreign>, Aesch. III. 68; <foreign lang="greek">πολλὰς...γραφὰς διώξας οὐδεμίαν εἷλεν</foreign>, Ant. 2, A.<foreign lang="greek">α</foreign>, 5. A victorious defendant is said <foreign lang="greek">γραφὴν</foreign> (<foreign lang="greek">δίκην</foreign>) <foreign lang="greek">ἀποφυγεῖν</foreign>, a defeated defendant <foreign lang="greek">γραφὴν</foreign> (<foreign lang="greek">δίκην</foreign>) <foreign lang="greek">ὀφλεῖν.ἀλλ̓ ἐμοὶ μὲν</foreign>: a familiar <foreign lang="greek">ἀποσιώπησις</foreign>, often quoted by the rhetoricians. What is plainly meant would sound unpleasant (<foreign lang="greek">δυσχερές</foreign>) and suggest disaster in the opening of his speech. See Quint. IX. 2, 54, who quotes &ldquo;quos ego&mdash; sed motos praestat componere fluctus,&rdquo; Aen. I. 135.
</p>
<p>7. <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ἐκ περιουσίας</lemma>, <gloss>at an advantage</gloss>, lit. <gloss>from an abundance</gloss>, like a rich man who stakes little compared with his wealth. In Luke xxi. 4, the rich cast into the treasury &ldquo;of their abundance&rdquo; or &ldquo;superfluity,&rdquo; <foreign lang="greek">ἐκ τοῦ περισσεύοντος αὐτοῖς</foreign>.
</p>
<p>8. <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ἕτερον δ̓</lemma> (sc. <foreign lang="greek">ἐλάττωμα</foreign>) corre- sponds to <foreign lang="greek">ἓν μὲν</foreign> in 3, and keeps up the construction of <foreign lang="greek">πολλὰ ἐλαττοῦμαι</foreign> in 1.&mdash;<lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ὃ...ὑπάρχει</lemma>, <gloss>which is a natural disposition of the whole human race</gloss>: <foreign lang="greek">πᾶσιν ἀνθρώποις</foreign> suggests the subject of <foreign lang="greek">ἀκούειν</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">ἄχθεσθαι</foreign>, which explain <foreign lang="greek">ἕτερον</foreign>.
</p></div>
<div type="section" n="4">
<p>2. <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ἐστι πρὸς ἡδονὴν</lemma>, <gloss>makes for pleasure</gloss> (<foreign lang="greek">ἐστὶν ἡδύ</foreign>, Schol.): cf. Aeschyl. Pr. 494, <foreign lang="greek">ἂν εἴη δαίμοσιν πρὸς ἡδονήν.ὡς ἔπος εἰπεῖν</foreign> modifies <foreign lang="greek">πᾶσιν</foreign>. Aeschines (III. 241) had warned the court against the self-glorification of Demosthenes. <pb n="4"/>
</p>
<p>5. <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ἀπολύσασθαι</lemma>: see <bibl n="Dem. 18.50">&sect; 50</bibl>.6.
</p>
<p>6. <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">καὶ πεποίηκα καὶ πεπολίτευ- μαι</lemma>: a familiar form of rhetorical amplification (opposed to modern ideas of style), for which ordinary speech would use <foreign lang="greek">πεπολίτευμαι</foreign> alone. Other instances are <foreign lang="greek">βεβούληται καὶ προῄρηται</foreign> (<bibl n="Dem. 18.2">&sect; 2</bibl>.6), <foreign lang="greek">πεπραγμένων καὶ πεπολιτευμένων</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">κατεψεύδου καὶ διέβαλλες</foreign> (<bibl n="Dem. 18.11">&sect; 11</bibl>.3-7), <foreign lang="greek">ἐτραγῴδει καὶ διεξῄει</foreign> (<bibl n="Dem. 18.13">&sect; 13</bibl>.6), <foreign lang="greek">διέβαλλε καὶ διεξῄει</foreign> (<bibl n="Dem. 18.14">&sect; 14</bibl>.2), <foreign lang="greek">ἐδίδαξας καὶ διεξῆλθες</foreign> (<bibl n="Dem. 18.22">&sect; 22</bibl>.10), <foreign lang="greek">πολεμεῖν καὶ διαφέρεσθαι</foreign> (<bibl n="Dem. 18.31">&sect; 31</bibl>.4). In these cases one verb is generic and the other specific; but sometimes two verbs of nearly or quite the same meaning are used together for a similar rhetorical effect, as <foreign lang="greek">πράττειν καὶ ποιεῖν</foreign> (<bibl n="Dem. 18.62">&sect; 62</bibl>.4), <foreign lang="greek">ζώντων καὶ ὄντων</foreign> (<bibl n="Dem. 18.72">&sect; 72</bibl>.3).
</p>
<p>7. <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">βαδίζω</lemma>, <gloss>proceed</gloss>, more formal than <gloss>come</gloss> or <gloss>go.</gloss>
</p>
<p>8. <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ὡς μετριώτατα</lemma>: cf. the full form <foreign lang="greek">ὡς ἂν δύνωμαι μετριώτατα</foreign>, <bibl n="Dem. 18.256">&sect; 256</bibl>.9.
</p>
<p>9. <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ὅ τι...ἀναγκάζῃ</lemma>, <gloss>whatever the case itself may require of me</gloss> (lit. <gloss>compel me</gloss>): with <foreign lang="greek">ἀναγκάζω</foreign> without an infin. cf. Quint. XI. I, 22, qui <gloss>hoc</gloss> se coegisset.
</p>
<p>10. <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">δίκαιος ἔχειν</lemma>: the common personal construction (<bibl n="Goodwin syntax 762">M.T. 762</bibl>). The apodosis is future in sense, after the future <foreign lang="greek">ὅ τι ἂν ἀναγκάζῃ</foreign>.
</p>
<p>11. <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">τοιοῦτον ἀγῶν̓</lemma>, <gloss>a suit like this</gloss>, i.e. in which Ctesiphon is indicted and Demosthenes accused: cf. &sect;<bibl n="Dem. 18.12">&sect; 12</bibl>&mdash;16.
</p></div>
<div type="section" n="5">
<p>1. <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ἂν ὁμολογῆσαι</lemma> (so <foreign lang="greek">Σ</foreign> and L): <foreign lang="greek">ἄν</foreign> after a comma is allowed when words belonging to the same clause precede, as here <foreign lang="greek">ὑμᾶς πάντας</foreign> (<bibl n="Goodwin syntax 222">M.T. 222</bibl>).
</p>
<p>3. <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">οὐδὲν ἐλάττονος</lemma>, <gloss>quite as great.</gloss>
</p>
<p>4. <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">πάντων ἀποστερεῖσθαι</lemma>, <gloss>to be deprived of anything</gloss>: cf. <foreign lang="greek">πανταχοῦ</foreign>, <gloss>anywhere</gloss>, <bibl n="Dem. 18.81">&sect; 81</bibl>.6.
</p>
<p>7. <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ὅσῳπερ</lemma>, (by so much) <gloss>as</gloss>: the implied <foreign lang="greek">τοσούτῳ</foreign> is felt as limiting <foreign lang="greek">μάλιστα</foreign> (sc. <foreign lang="greek">λυπηρὸν καὶ χαλεπόν</foreign>).&mdash; <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">καὶ</lemma> before <foreign lang="greek">τὸ τυχεῖν</foreign> expresses the parallelism (so to speak) between <gloss>losing</gloss> and <gloss>gaining</gloss> the privileges: see <foreign lang="greek">ἃ καὶ διεκωλύθη</foreign>, <bibl n="Dem. 18.60">&sect; 60</bibl>.4, and note. <pb n="5"/> Such a <foreign lang="greek">καί</foreign> can seldom be expressed in English, except by emphasis.
</p></div>
<div type="section" n="6">
<p>2. <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ἀξιῶ καὶ δέομαι</lemma>: see note on <bibl n="Dem. 18.4">&sect; 4</bibl>.6.
</p>
<p>3. <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">δικαίως</lemma> belongs to <foreign lang="greek">ἀκοῦσαι</foreign>, from which it is separated partly for emphasis, and partly to bring it directly before <foreign lang="greek">ὥσπερ</foreign>. It cannot be taken with <foreign lang="greek">ἀπολογουμένου</foreign>, as the laws (<bibl n="Dem. 18.2">&sect; 2</bibl>.3) have no reference to <foreign lang="greek">ἀπολογία</foreign>, but require the judges to hear both sides impartially.
</p>
<p>4. <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ὁ τιθεὶς ἐξ ἀρχῆς</lemma>, i.e. <gloss>the ori- ginal maker</gloss>: <foreign lang="greek">ὁ νόμον τιθείς</foreign> is used like <foreign lang="greek">νομοθέτης</foreign>, for the <gloss>lawgiver</gloss>, whose title is perpetual.
</p>
<p>5. <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">δημοτικὸς</lemma>, <gloss>a friend of the people</gloss> or <gloss>of popular government</gloss>: see <bibl n="Aristoph. Cl. 1187">Ar. Nub. 1187</bibl>, <foreign lang="greek">ὁ Σόλων ὁ παλαιὸς ἦν φιλόδημος τὴν φύσιν.οὐ μόνον...ὀμωμοκέναι</foreign>: i.e. Solon thought that these provisions for an impartial hearing should have not merely the ordinary sanction which all laws have by enactment (<foreign lang="greek">τῷ γράψαι</foreign>), but the further security which they gained by the judges swearing to uphold them. This double sanction was secured by enacting that these provisions of law should be a part of the Heliastic oath. <foreign lang="greek">γράφω</foreign>, besides meaning <gloss>to propose a law</gloss> or <gloss>decree</gloss>, often refers to <gloss>the enactment</gloss> as a whole, as here.
</p></div>
<div type="section" n="7">
<p>2. <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">τὰς αἰτίας καὶ τὰς δια- βολὰς</lemma>, here used like <foreign lang="greek">λοιδορία τε καὶ αἰτία</foreign> in XXII. 21, 22. There <foreign lang="greek">αἰτία</foreign> is thus defined, as opposed to <foreign lang="greek">ἔλεγχος</foreign>: <foreign lang="greek">αἰτία μὲν γάρ ἐστιν ὅταν τις ψιλῷ χρησάμενος λόγῳ μὴ παράσχηται πίστιν ὧν λέγει, ἔλεγχος δὲ ὅταν ὧν ἂν εἴπῃ τις καὶ τἀληθὲς ὁμοῦ δείξῃ</foreign>.

See Shilleto on Thuc. I. 23 and 69.

<p>3. <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">τοῦ πρότερος λέγειν</lemma>: in public suits (<foreign lang="greek">γραφαί</foreign>) in the Heliastic courts, each side spoke once (though the time might be divided among several speakers), the plaintiff first; in private suits (<foreign lang="greek">δίκαι</foreign>), and in the Areopagus, each side was allowed a second argument.

<p>3. <foreign lang="greek">ἡ προαίρεσις αὕτη· αὕτη·</foreign> (so <foreign lang="greek">Σ</foreign>) is much more expressive than <foreign lang="greek">αὐτή</foreign> (with no stop), pointing vividly to the following statement of the true purpose of Aeschines. It also gives <foreign lang="greek">τῶν μέντοι κατηγοριῶν κ.τ.λ.</foreign> (6) its proper relation to <foreign lang="greek">ἐχθροῦ μέν</foreign>. The Schol. charges this passage with <foreign lang="greek">ἀσάφεια πολλή</foreign>. The thought is as follows:&mdash; The charges include some of the gravest known to the law, which provides the severest penalties for the offences; but this suit was never brought to punish anybody for these. I will tell you what its object is (<foreign lang="greek">αὕτη</foreign>): it is to give a personal enemy an opportunity to vent his spite and malice, while it gives the state no means of properly punishing my crimes if I am guilty. The first clause, <foreign lang="greek">τὰ μὲν... τιμωρίας</foreign> (1&mdash;3), states the gravity of the actual charges, and is opposed to the following <foreign lang="greek">τοῦ δὲ...αὕτη</foreign>. The latter introduces the double construction, (<gloss>a</gloss>) <foreign lang="greek">ἐχθροῦ μὲν...τοιαῦτα</foreign> and (<gloss>b</gloss>) <foreign lang="greek">τῶν μέντοι...οὐδ’  ἐγγύς</foreign>, in which the motive of Aeschines and the inadequacy of this suit to deal with the alleged crimes are declared.

Finally, <foreign lang="greek">οὐ γὰρ δήπου...ἐγράψατο</foreign> (<bibl n="Dem. 18.13">&sect; 13</bibl>.11-13) shows that Aeschines, by his present action, virtually admits that the course just pointed out (<foreign lang="greek">ἐφ’  οἷς...γραφόμενον</foreign>) is the only consistent one.

<p>1. <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">Φωκικοῦ πολέμου</lemma>: the Sacred or Phocian War began in 356 &mdash;355 and ended in 346 B.C. Demosthenes made his first speech in the Assembly (on the Symmories) in 354 B.C. (Hist. &sect;<bibl n="Dem. 18.4">&sect; 4</bibl>, 8.)

<p>3. <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">οὕτω διέκεισθε</lemma>: when we com- pare this judicious account of the feelings of the Athenians towards the Phocians and Thebans in 346 B.C. and earlier with the impassioned language of the speech on the Embassy and of the Second and Third Philippics, we see the sobering effect of time and of recent events. When the Thebans were exulting in the devastation of Phocis by Philip, and the political interests of Athens demanded that the Phocians should be protected as allies, Demosthenes seemed to overlook their sacrilegious plundering of Delphi, which he now acknowledges. Again, the intimate alliance of Thebes and Athens in 339 B.C., and still more the destruction of Thebes by Alexander in 335, had changed the Athenians' bitter hatred to the deepest sympathy. Still the orator cannot deny the old hostility against Thebes, nor the chief ground for it.

<p>2. <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">προσάγειν τοὺς πρέσβεις</lemma> (sc. <foreign lang="greek">εἰς τὴν ἐκκλησίαν</foreign>): these were the ambassadors sent by Philip to negotiate the peace. Foreign embassies first presented themselves to the Senate, which by a decree provided for their introduction to the Assembly: see Aesch. II. 58, <foreign lang="greek">ταῖς δὲ ξενικαῖς πρεσβείαις ἡ βουλὴ τὰς εἰς τὸν δῆμον προσόδους προβουλεύει</foreign>.

III. 76). The stone Dionysiac theatre was at this time building under the direction of Lycurgus; and the lessee was called <foreign lang="greek">ἀρχιτέκτων</foreign>, as an important part of his duties was the superintendence of the work of building. See D&ouml;rpfeld and Reisch, Griech. Theater, 36&mdash;40, where the building of the theatre is assigned to about 350&mdash;325 B.C. Aeschines (61, 76) makes this official politeness of Demosthenes one ground of his grotesque charge of flattering Philip! To this Demosth. alludes in <bibl n="Dem. 18.294">&sect; 294</bibl>.2, <foreign lang="greek">ὃς γὰρ ἐμοὶ Φιλιππισμὸν, κ.τ.λ.</foreign> Aesch., however, mentions only the introduction of the envoys to the theatre.

It is implied that the distinguished strangers could have been admitted, like other people, to the common seats by merely paying their two obols.

<p>This decree is a good speci- men of ignorant forgery.

<p>4, 5. <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">Εὔβοιαν...Αἴγιναν</lemma>: Euboea and Megara had been in the hands of the Spartans before the end of the Peloponnesian war. Aegina, which Athens had settled with her own people in 431, after expelling the native population, was restored to its former owners (so far as this was possible) by Lysander in 405, as he was on his way to attack Athens (Thuc. II. 27;  <bibl n="Xen. Hell. 2.2.9">Xen. Hell. II. 2, 9</bibl>). Boeotia as a whole was nominally allied with Sparta; but Thebes and other towns became disgusted with Sparta's tyrannical conduct soon after the end of the war, and though Thebes had been the greatest enemy of Athens when the peace was made, she harboured Thrasybulus and his fellow exiles before they attacked the Thirty in 403. This disaffection ended in the Boeotian war in 395, in which Athens aided Thebes; in the battle of Haliartus the allies gained a doubtful victory over Sparta, which was made decisive by the death of Lysander on the field. (See Grote IX. 409.) The invasion of Boeotia by Lysander and his Spartan army justifies <foreign lang="greek">τὴν Βοιωτίαν ἅπασαν</foreign> from the Athenian point of view.

The Corinthian war was the result of a combination of Athenians, Corinthians, Boeotians, Euboeans, Argives, and others against Sparta. In the battle of Corinth, the Spartans were victorious. See Grote IX. 426&mdash;429. The beautiful monument, representing a young warrior on horseback, now standing near the Dipylon gate of Athens, was erected in honour of Dexileos, one of the Athenian horsemen slain in this battle.

In 370 Epaminondas with a Theban army invaded Laconia and marched up to the city of Sparta itself; but he did not venture to enter the unwalled town and withdrew into Arcadia. At this time he established Messene and Megalopolis, to hold Sparta in check. In this trying emergency, Sparta humiliated herself so far as to ask help from her old enemy, Athens. Her request was granted, and Iphicrates was sent into Peloponnesus to the aid of Sparta with 12,000 Athenians in the spring of 369 B.C. This saved Sparta from another invasion at this time. The alliance then formed remained unbroken, though sometimes strained, until after the battle of Mantinea in 362 B.C., in which Athens fought on the side of Sparta.

(Grote X. ch. 79, p. 392.) Oropus had long been a bone of contention between Athens and Thebes.

But the richest of all, the leaders of the symmories (<bibl n="Dem. 18.103">&sect; 103</bibl>.4), sometimes ingeniously used their legal duty of advancing the money for the trierarchy in case of special necessity as a means of avoiding even their own legal share of the expense. They could bargain with a contractor to do all the work for a fixed sum (e.g. a talent), which they advanced, afterwards assessing this whole sum, or an unfair part of it, on their poorer colleagues.

Under the system which prevailed from 357 to 340 B.C., the 1200 richest citizens, who alone were liable to the duty of the trierarchy, were divided into 20 symmories, regularly of 60 men each. But exemption or changes in property might reduce the whole number of 1200 and the number in each symmory in any year. To each of these symmories was assigned a number of triremes to be fitted out in each year, regulated by the needs of the state. The symmory divided itself into smaller bodies (<foreign lang="greek">συντέλειαι</foreign>), each of which equipped a single ship. The expense was borne equally by all the members, without regard to their wealth. Each symmory probably had a single leader, and the 20 leaders, with the two classes called <foreign lang="greek">δεύτεροι</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">τρίτοι</foreign> (who are not mentioned elsewhere), evidently belonged to the <foreign lang="greek">τριακόσιοι</foreign>, perhaps including all of that class in the symmories (15 in each). The new law of Demosthenes imposed the burden of the trierarchy on the members of each symmory according to their taxable property, thus greatly increasing the assessment of the richer and diminishing that of the poorer members. Of this a striking case is given in <bibl n="Dem. 18.104">&sect; 104</bibl>.6, 7.

Whenever anyone brought a <foreign lang="greek">γραφὴ παρανόμων</foreign> against a law or decree, he was required to bind himself by an oath, called <foreign lang="greek">ὑπωμοσία</foreign>, to prosecute the case. This had the effect of suspending the law or decree if it was already finally passed, or of stopping a decree which had passed only the Senate (i.e. a <foreign lang="greek">προβούλευμα</foreign>) from being voted on by the Assembly, until the <foreign lang="greek">γραφὴ παρανόμων</foreign> could be tried. (See Essay II.) The meaning here is that Demosthenes was offered large sums if he would either decline to bring his new law before the <foreign lang="greek">νομοθέται</foreign> (<foreign lang="greek">μὴ θεῖναι</foreign>) or else quietly let it drop (<foreign lang="greek">ἐᾶν</foreign>) when a <foreign lang="greek">γραφὴ παρανόμων</foreign> was brought against it after it was passed.

<p>The sophistical character of the argument of &sect;<bibl n="Dem. 18.112">&sect; 112</bibl>&mdash;119 explains the anxiety of the orator to cover its weakness by its position in the oration. The reply of Aeschines (III. 17 ff.) to this <foreign lang="greek">ἄφυκτον λόγον, ὅν φησι Δημοσθένης</foreign>, probably written or greatly modified after hearing this passage, is conclusive. The law quoted by Aesch. (11), <foreign lang="greek">τοὺς ὑπευθύνους μὴ στεφανοῦν</foreign>, certainly made no exception for those who gave money to the state while in office. Indeed, this very claim is one which needed to be established by the <foreign lang="greek">εὔθυναι</foreign>, in which it might be disputed: see Aesch. 23, <foreign lang="greek">ἔασον ἀμφισβητῆσαί σοι τὸν βουλόμενον τῶν πολιτῶν ὡς οὐκ ἐπέδωκας</foreign>.

The specious argument that a man cannot fairly be called to account for the expenditure of his own money on public <pb n="68"/> works could not release Demosthenes from <foreign lang="greek">εὔθυναι</foreign> when he had obviously had public money in his hands.

<p>4. <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">οὐ περὶ τούτων...ἐπέδωκα</lemma>: this argument assumes that an ordinary <foreign lang="greek">ὑπεύθυνος</foreign> could be crowned, before passing his <foreign lang="greek">εὔθυναι</foreign>, for a gift to the state which was not connected with his office. But this was not the case with the gifts of Demosthenes. These were both closely connected with the funds which he held as an officer of state, and the argument of Aeschines (23) applies to them in its full force. Demosthenes says nothing which shows that Ctesiphon did not violate the letter and even the spirit <pb n="69"/> of the law <foreign lang="greek">τοὺς ὑπευθύνους μὴ στεφανοῦν</foreign>. And yet it is more than likely that the friends of Demosthenes, in their eagerness to crown him for his noble services, overlooked the technical obstacle to their action; and the court appears to have decided to overlook their oversight.

Before this board of auditors every magistrate had to appear for his <foreign lang="greek">εὔθυναι</foreign> at the end of his term of office; and they (generally as a matter of form) brought him before a Heliastic court of 501 judges, in which anyone might appear and accuse him of any offence connected with his office.

This would mean that Aeschines read a mutilated law to the court, which in full would have told against him, and that Demosthenes simply supplied the omitted words and so ended the argument. This is more than we can believe either of Aeschines or of the court. Our trouble is, that we do not know what law the clerk read to the court at the end of <bibl n="Dem. 18.120">&sect; 120</bibl>, and therefore do not know in what connection the words now quoted by Demosthenes stood.

<p>2. <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">τῇ προθεσμίᾳ</lemma>, the limitations of time set by law to bringing certain actions. Debts were outlawed in five years, and this limitation applied to many other cases. The mover of a law was personally liable to the <foreign lang="greek">γραφὴ παρανόμων</foreign> only one year. Of course <gloss>in this suit</gloss> nothing could make Demosthenes personally amenable to any law, as he was only Ctesiphon's advocate; but the meaning of <foreign lang="greek">ἀθῷος</foreign> is that no suit could now legally be brought against him personally for any of the offences with which he is charged before the court. He bitterly complains of the power given to Aeschines by the form of this suit to accuse him of crimes for which he could not indict him: see &sect;<bibl n="Dem. 18.9">&sect; 9</bibl>&mdash;16.&mdash; <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">τῷ κεκρίσθαι πολλάκις πρότερον</lemma> (sc. <foreign lang="greek">ἐμέ</foreign>): probably referring to the cases mentioned in &sect;<bibl n="Dem. 18.83">&sect; 83</bibl>, 222&mdash;224, which covered important parts of the present case. He may also refer to actual indictments against himself: for the time since Chaeronea we have his statement in &sect;<bibl n="Dem. 18.249">&sect; 249</bibl>, 250, e.g. <foreign lang="greek">κατὰ τὴν ἡμέραν ἑκάστην ἐκρινόμην</foreign>.

<p>The next main division of the argument is devoted chiefly to the account of the means by which Aeschines gained for Philip an entrance into Greece with his army, by getting up the Amphissian war (&sect;<bibl n="Dem. 18.139">&sect; 139</bibl>&mdash;159), and of the measures by which Demosthenes opposed this joint plot of Aeschines and Philip (as he represents it), especially his negotiations with Thebes in 339&mdash;338 B.C., which led to the alliance of that city with Athens (&sect;<bibl n="Dem. 18.160">&sect; 160</bibl>&mdash;226). The orator introduces these accounts by a general sketch of Aeschines' life and that of his parents, full of offensive scurrility (&sect;<bibl n="Dem. 18.126">&sect; 126</bibl>&mdash;131), followed by a brief account of some of the lesser political offences of Aeschines (&sect;<bibl n="Dem. 18.132">&sect; 132</bibl>&mdash;138).
</p>
<p>The orator's account of his own political acts in the eventful year before the battle of Chaeronea, connected with his vigorous defence of the policy of Athens under his guidance in her last resistance to the power of Philip, is the most eloquent passage in the oration (&sect;<bibl n="Dem. 18.160">&sect; 160</bibl>&mdash;226).

In 346&mdash;5 B.C. a general revision of the lists of citizens was ordered at Athens; and the members of each deme went through its own list (the <foreign lang="greek">γραμματεῖον ληξιαρχικόν</foreign>), voting on each name which was questioned. This process was called <foreign lang="greek">διαψήφισις</foreign> (<foreign lang="greek">διαψηφίζομαι</foreign>), and the rejection of any person was called <foreign lang="greek">ἀποψήφισις</foreign> (<foreign lang="greek">ἀποψηφίζομαι</foreign>). Demosthenes wrote his oration against Eubulides (LVII.) for a client who had been thus rejected and had appealed (as every such person might) to a Heliastic court. Antiphon was probably rejected at the same <foreign lang="greek">διαψήφισις</foreign> (see Dem. LVII. 2, <foreign lang="greek">πολλῶν ἐξεληλαμένων δικαίως ἐκ πάντων τῶν δήμων</foreign>), and afterwards offered his services to Philip.
</p>
<p>4. <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">καταστήσαντος εἰς τὴν ἐκ- κλησίαν</lemma>: it is hardly probable that Demosthenes brought Antiphon before the Assembly without some official authority. At the time of the passage of his trierarchic law (340 B.C.) he held the office of <foreign lang="greek">ἐπιστάτης τοῦ ναυτικοῦ</foreign> (Aesch. III. 222). Antiphon was probably arrested by <foreign lang="greek">μήνυσις</foreign>, <gloss>denunciation</gloss> to the people, the process by which those charged with mutilating the Hermae in 415 B.C. were dealt with. Except in the rare cases in which the Assembly itself undertook the trial (as in the <foreign lang="greek">μήνυσις</foreign> against Phidias, Plut. Pericl. 31), the people either sent the accused to a Heliastic court for trial or discharged him. The appeals of men like Aeschines moved the Assembly to discharge Antiphon: but the Areopagus interposed, and ordered (through the Assembly) that Antiphon be tried before a court, which condemned him to the rack and to death.

The Assembly chose Aeschines as their counsel; but the Areopagus, to which the people had given authority to revise the election, rejected him and sent Hyperides in his place.

Demosth. had repeatedly warned the people of this peril: even in the First Philippic (351 B.C.) he had said (50), <foreign lang="greek">κἂν μὴ νῦν ἐθέλωμεν ἐκεῖ πολεμεῖν αὐτῷ, ἐνθάδ’  ἴσως ἀναγκασθησόμεθα τοῦτο ποιεῖν</foreign>.

It is a mere challenge, made with no idea of its being accepted. For the genitive with <foreign lang="greek">ἐπὶ</foreign> see LVII. 61 (end). The time allotted to each speaker in most <pb n="88"/> cases was measured by the clepsydra or water-clock (Dict. Antiq. under Horologium), a fixed number of <foreign lang="greek">ἀμφορεῖς</foreign> of water being poured in according to the importance of the case. Thus Aeschines (II. 126) says, <foreign lang="greek">πρὸς ἕνδεκα γὰρ ἀμφορέας ἐν διαμεμετρημένῃ τῇ ἡμέρᾳ κρίνομαι</foreign>, eleven <foreign lang="greek">ἀμφορεῖς</foreign> (about 100 gallons), allowed each speaker in cases of <foreign lang="greek">παραπρεσβεία</foreign>, being the largest amount mentioned. The term <foreign lang="greek">διαμεμετρημένη ἡμέρα</foreign> is explained in Aesch. III. 197. In important public suits the day was divided into three parts, and the clepsydra was filled three times, the first measure of water being given to the accuser, the second (of equal amount) to the accused, and the third (in <foreign lang="greek">ἀγῶνες τιμητοί</foreign>, if the accused was convicted), a smaller measure, to the <foreign lang="greek">τίμησις</foreign>, the decision <foreign lang="greek">ὅ τι χρὴ παθεῖν ἢ ἀποτίσαι</foreign>.

This distinct statement that Aesch. was then thought &ldquo;too insignificant to do so much harm,&rdquo; with the apprehension that the court may make the same mistake again in the present case, is one of the strongest proofs that the case against Aeschines really came to trial, that the speeches de Falsa Legatione were actually spoken, and that Aeschines was acquitted by a small majority.

It is commonly assumed that <foreign lang="greek">ἐὰν</foreign> with the subjunctive expresses greater probability or likelihood that the supposition may prove true than <foreign lang="greek">εἰ</foreign> with the optative; and this double antithesis is often cited as a strong confirmation of this view. It seems to be overlooked that all four suppositions are in <gloss>oratio obliqua</gloss> after past tenses, and would all be expressed in the <gloss>oratio recta</gloss> (i.e. as Philip conceived them) by subjunctives, <foreign lang="greek">ἐὰν συμπείθω, αἱρεθῶ, εἰσηγῆται, Ἀθηναῖος ᾖ</foreign>, which would all be retained if the leading verb were present or future. If these forms now show any inherent distinction between subj. and opt. as regards probability, this has been introduced by the <gloss>oratio obliqua</gloss> after a past tense. The two subjunctives express the plans which Philip had most at heart, and the two optatives express the opposite alternatives.

Demosthenes cannot understand by <foreign lang="greek">δίκην ἐπαγόντων</foreign> what Aeschines means by <foreign lang="greek">εἰσέφερον δόγμα</foreign>.

And the further remark of Demosthenes, <foreign lang="greek">οὐδ’  ἃ νῦν οὗτος προφασίζεται</foreign> (5), seems to imply that Aeschines had told a different story about the intentions of the Amphissians when he made his report of the meeting at Delphi (III. 125) from that which he told in court.

<p>Demosthenes distinctly implies that Cottyphus was made general at the spring meeting, but that, after a mere pretence of war, intrigues at once began for superseding him by Philip at the autumnal meeting (<foreign lang="greek">εἰς τὴν ἐπιοῦσαν Πυλαίαν</foreign>). Aeschines, on the contrary, whose whole object is to show that a real Amphictyonic war was intended, with no help or thought of help from Philip, and to represent Philip's final appointment as commander as a remote afterthought, states that no action was taken against the Amphissians in the spring, but that a special meeting was called before the regular autumnal <foreign lang="greek">Πυλαία</foreign>, to take such action (124). At this special meeting, which Athens and Thebes refused to attend (Aesch. 126&mdash;128), Cottyphus was chosen general, (according to Aesch.) while Philip was &ldquo;away off in Scythia&rdquo;; and after a successful campaign the Amphissians were fined and their offending citizens were banished.

Aeschines says (140) of Philip's sudden movement, <foreign lang="greek">τὸν πόλεμον ὃν πρότερον ἐξήλασεν ἐκ τῆς χώρας τῆς Βοιωτῶν</foreign> (i.e. the Phocian war), <foreign lang="greek">τοῦτον πάλιν τὸν αὐτὸν πόλεμον</foreign> (i.e. a similar sacred war) <foreign lang="greek">ἐπῆγε διὰ τῆς Φωκίδος ἐπ’  αὐτὰς τὰς Θήβας</foreign>. Philip must have been made general in the early autumn of 339 B.C., and probably seized Elatea in the late autumn or early winter; so that the campaign lasted about eight or nine months until the battle of Chaeronea in August or September 338. A &ldquo;winter battle&rdquo; is naturally mentioned in <bibl n="Dem. 18.216">&sect; 216</bibl>.6. The startling effect at Athens of the news from Elatea is described in &sect;<bibl n="Dem. 18.169">&sect; 169</bibl> ff.

After speaking of the enmity between Athens and Thebes, which men like Aeschines had encouraged (&sect;<bibl n="Dem. 18.160">&sect; 160</bibl>&mdash; 163), he gives a graphic account of the panic excited at Athens by Philip's seizure of Elatea, and of the manner in which he took advantage of this emergency to bring Athens and Thebes to a better understanding and even to an alliance against the common enemy (&sect;<bibl n="Dem. 18.168">&sect; 168</bibl>&mdash;226). Into this account he introduces (&sect;<bibl n="Dem. 18.189">&sect; 189</bibl>&mdash;210) a most eloquent and earnest defence of the whole line of policy in opposition to Philip which Athens had followed chiefly by his advice. He pleads that Athens, with her glorious traditions, could have taken no other course, even if she had seen the fatal defeat at Chaeronea in advance. This is the most eloquent and impassioned passage in the oration; and it is addressed not merely to the court, but to the whole people and to future ages.

<p/><p>&sect;<bibl n="Dem. 18.169">&sect; 169</bibl>&mdash;180. Here follows the famous description of the panic in Athens when the news of the seizure of Elatea arrived, and of the meeting of the Assembly which was suddenly called to consider the alarming situation. This is a celebrated example of <foreign lang="greek">διατύπωσις</foreign>, <gloss>vivid delineation.</gloss>
</p></div>
<div type="section" n="169">
<p>1. The succession of tenses, <foreign lang="greek">ἦν, ἧκε</foreign> (<gloss>had come</gloss>), and <foreign lang="greek">κατείληπται</foreign> (the direct form for the indirect), makes the narrative lively and picturesque at the outset. Much would have been lost if he had said <foreign lang="greek">ἦλθε δ̓ ἀγγέλλων τις ὡς κατειλημμένη εἴη.ὡς τοὺς πρυτάνεις</foreign>: the message came to the Prytanes, the fifty senators of one of the ten tribes, who for their term of one-tenth of the year represented the authority of the state. Their office was the <foreign lang="greek">θόλος</foreign> or <foreign lang="greek">σκιάς</foreign>, a round building with a cupola in the <foreign lang="greek">ἀγορά</foreign>, adjoining the Senate-house and the <foreign lang="greek">μητρῷον</foreign> with its record-office. There the <foreign lang="greek">ἐπιστάτης</foreign> of the Prytanes was expected to spend his whole day and night of office, with a third of the Prytanes whom he had selected (Arist. Pol. Ath. 44.5), so as to be accessible in emergencies like the present; and there the state provided meals for all the Prytanes. The <foreign lang="greek">θόλος</foreign> is distinct from the ancient Prytaneum or City Hall, where certain privileged persons (<foreign lang="greek">ἀείσιτοι</foreign>) had their meals at a public table, to which ambassadors and other guests of the state were sometimes invited.
</p>
<p>4. <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">τοὺς...σκηνῶν</lemma>: cf. <bibl n="Dem. 18.44">&sect; 44</bibl>.4.
</p>
<p>5. <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">τὰ γέρρα</lemma>, probably the wicker- work with which the booths (<foreign lang="greek">σκῆναι</foreign>) in the market-place were covered. The word can mean also anything made of twigs, and is used of a wicker fence which enclosed the <foreign lang="greek">ἐκκλησία</foreign> (see Harpocr. under <foreign lang="greek">γέρρα</foreign>, and LIX. 90). But the close connection of the two clauses, <gloss>drove out those in the booths</gloss> and <gloss>burnt the</gloss> <foreign lang="greek">γέρρα</foreign>, shows that the <foreign lang="greek">γέρρα</foreign> which were burnt were taken from the booths. Otherwise there is no reason for driving the poor hucksters out at all. If it is said that this was done to prepare for the &ldquo;monster meeting&rdquo; the next morning, we must remember, first, that the Assembly was held in the Pnyx, not in the <foreign lang="greek">ἀγορά</foreign>; and, secondly, that there was to be a meeting of the Senate before that of the Assembly, which would give time enough to make all necessary preparations after daybreak. To suppose, further, that the booths were torn to pieces and burnt on the spot after dark, merely to clear the <foreign lang="greek">ἀγορά</foreign>, when there was no pressure of time, even if the place needed clearing at all, is to impute to the Prytanes conduct well worthy of <pb n="107"/> madmen. Such a panic as this senseless proceeding would have caused was surely the last object which these guardians of the state could have had, when they left their supper unfinished and hastened into the market-place. Their first object certainly was to secure a full meeting of the Assembly the next morning. It will be noticed that while some (<foreign lang="greek">οἱ μὲν</foreign>) of the Prytanes were engaged in clearing the booths, others (<foreign lang="greek">οἱ δὲ</foreign>) were summoning the ten Generals. The Generals and the Prytanes had the duty of calling special meetings of the Assembly (<foreign lang="greek">ἐκκλησίας συγκλήτους</foreign>): see Thuc. IV. 118.52, <foreign lang="greek">ἐκκλησίαν δὲ ποιήσαντας τοὺς στρατηγοὺς καὶ τοὺς πρυτάνεις</foreign>, and II. 59.11 (of Pericles), <foreign lang="greek">σύλλογον ποιήσας</foreign> (<foreign lang="greek">ἔτιδ’  ἐστρατήγει</foreign>). There can, therefore, be hardly a doubt that the two acts were connected with summoning the Assembly. To do this effectually it was necessary to alarm the whole of Attica immediately; and the natural method for this was to light bonfires on some of the hills near Athens, which would be a signal to distant demes to light fires on their own hills. A fire on Lycabettus could thus give signals directly and indirectly to the whole of Attica, and probably this was understood as a call of the citizens to a special Assembly. As material for lighting signal fires might not always be on hand, it is likely that the dry covering of the booths struck the eyes of the Prytanes as they came out of their office, and that they took them in their haste for this purpose. Their high authority was needed to prevent resistance on the part of the owners of the booths.

<p>11. <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ἄνω καθῆτο</lemma>, i.e. the people in their impatience were already seated in the Pnyx: <foreign lang="greek">ἄνω</foreign> shows that the Assembly sat on a hill, probably in the place now known as the Pnyx. See XXV. 9 and 20, <foreign lang="greek">τὸν δῆμον εἰς τὴν ἐκκλησίαν ἀναβαίνειν</foreign>. For the identity of this famous place, see Crow in Papers of the American School at Athens, IV. pp. 205&mdash;260.

Each of the three leading negatives (<foreign lang="greek">οὐκ, οὐδ’ , οὐδ̓</foreign>) introduces a pair of clauses of which the second is negative, and which <gloss>as a whole</gloss> it negatives.

See Longinus on the Sublime, 39, 4: <foreign lang="greek">ὑψηλόν γε τοῦτο δοκεῖ νόημα, καὶ ἔστι τῷ ὄντι</foreign> <pb n="117"/> <foreign lang="greek">θαυμάσιον, ὃ τῷ ψηφίσματι ὁ Δημοσθένης ἐπιφέρει...ἀλλ’  αὐτῆς τῆς διανοίας οὐκ ἔλαττον τῇ ἁρμονίᾳ πεφώνηται</foreign>. He then discourses on the fatal effect which would result from a change in the order of the words, or from the omission or addition of a single syllable (as <foreign lang="greek">ὡς νέφος</foreign> or <foreign lang="greek">ὥσπερ εἰ νέφος</foreign>).

<div type="section" n="194">
<p>1. <foreign lang="greek">σκηπτὸς [ἢ χειμὼν</foreign>]: most recent editors omit <foreign lang="greek">ἢ χειμὼν</foreign> on the ground that the orator, after comparing the sudden raid of Philip to a thunderbolt, would not weaken his figure by adding a common storm. This holds good even when we admit that <foreign lang="greek">χειμών</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">σκηπτός</foreign> are not the same thing. Aristotle (de Mundo, 4, 19), after describing <foreign lang="greek">κεραυνός, πρηστήρ</foreign>, and <foreign lang="greek">τυφῶν</foreign>, adds <foreign lang="greek">ἕκαστον δὲ τούτων κατασκῆψαν εἰς τὴν γῆν σκηπτὸς ὀνομάζεται. σκηπτός</foreign>, therefore, is not only a <gloss>stroke of lightning</gloss>, but also a <gloss>furious thunderstorm</gloss>; while <foreign lang="greek">χειμών</foreign> is <gloss>winter</gloss>, a <gloss>winterstorm</gloss>, or a <gloss>storm</gloss> in general. Perhaps <foreign lang="greek">ἢ χειμὼν</foreign> here was originally a marginal reference to <foreign lang="greek">χειμῶνι χρησάμενον</foreign> (6).
</p>
<p>3. <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">τί χρὴ ποιεῖν</lemma> (sc. <foreign lang="greek">ἡμᾶς</foreign>), <gloss>what ought we to do?</gloss> The answer is given in the two following sentences. The sense is: &ldquo;What are we to <gloss>do</gloss>? We <pb n="120"/> are to do just what a <foreign lang="greek">ναύκληρος</foreign> would do if any one were to blame him, etc. He would say &lsquo;I was not <foreign lang="greek">κυβερνήτης</foreign>,&rsquo; just as I can say &lsquo;No more was I <foreign lang="greek">στρατηγός</foreign>.&rsquo;&rdquo; The apodosis to <foreign lang="greek">εἴ τις... αἰτιῷτο</foreign> being suppressed (except <foreign lang="greek">ἂν</foreign> in 4), its subject <foreign lang="greek">ναύκληρος</foreign> appears in the protasis as <foreign lang="greek">ναύκληρον</foreign>, and the implied <foreign lang="greek">ὥσπερ ἂν ναύκληρος ποιήσειεν</foreign> appears in <foreign lang="greek">φήσειεν ἂν</foreign> (9) with its quotation, <foreign lang="greek">ἀλλ’  οὔτ̓ ἐκυβέρνων...τῶν πάντων. ἡμῶν</foreign> (2) and <foreign lang="greek">ἐγὼ</foreign> (10) show that the orator identifies the people with himself in the comparison with <foreign lang="greek">ναύκληρος</foreign>. Cf. <bibl n="Dem. 18.243">&sect; 243</bibl>.
</p>
<p>4. <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ναύκληρον</lemma>, properly a <gloss>ship- owner</gloss>, who sails in his own ship (as <foreign lang="greek">ἔμπορος</foreign>), but generally employs a <foreign lang="greek">κυβερνήτης</foreign> or <gloss>sailing-master</gloss> to navigate the ship. In Plato's famous figure of the ship of State (Rep. VI. p. 488), the <foreign lang="greek">ναύκληρος</foreign> is the honest old man <foreign lang="greek">Δῆμος Πυκνίτης</foreign>, who knows little of navigation, and is not skilful enough to keep a professional sailingmaster in authority, and soon lets the command of the ship fall into the hands of the most artful and unscrupulous landsmen on board.

<p>3. <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">τί χρῆν προσδοκᾶν;</lemma> this apodosis (like the similar one in lines 7&mdash;9) has two protases, one simply past, the other past with the condition unfulfilled. Each apodosis conforms to the latter condition. But we have in line 3 <foreign lang="greek">τί χρῆν προσδοκᾶν;</foreign> (without <foreign lang="greek">ἄν</foreign>), but in 7&mdash;9 <foreign lang="greek">τί ἂν...προσδοκῆσαι χρῆν;</foreign> the two sentences being otherwise similar. We certainly should not notice the difference if the same form (either with or without <foreign lang="greek">ἄν</foreign>) were used in both. And yet the distinction is one of principle, and is generally obvious and important. In the form without <foreign lang="greek">ἄν</foreign> the chief force falls on the infinitive, while in the form with <foreign lang="greek">ἄν</foreign> it falls on <foreign lang="greek">ἔδει, ἐξῆν, χρῆν</foreign>, etc., to which the <foreign lang="greek">ἄν</foreign> belongs. Thus <foreign lang="greek">ἐξῆν σοι ἐλθεῖν</foreign> (in this sense) is <gloss>you might have gone</gloss> (but did not go), while <foreign lang="greek">ἐξῆν ἄν σοι ἐλθεῖν</foreign> is <gloss>it would have been possible for you to go</gloss> in a certain case (but in fact it was not possible). Here we may translate <foreign lang="greek">τί χρῆν προσδοκᾶν</foreign><gloss>; what ought we to have expected</gloss> (which we did not find ourselves expecting)? and <foreign lang="greek">τί ἂν προσδοκῆσαι χρῆν</foreign><gloss>; what should we then have had to expect</gloss> <pb n="121"/> (which in fact we did not have to expect)?

Here <foreign lang="greek">δίκη</foreign> has its widest legal sense of <gloss>lawsuit</gloss> in general, including both <foreign lang="greek">γραφή</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">δίκη</foreign> (in its narrower sense). <foreign lang="greek">ἴδιαι δίκαι</foreign> are suits which concern individuals and their ordinary business relations (<foreign lang="greek">συμβόλαια</foreign>), which of course must be judged <gloss>with reference to special statutes</gloss> (<foreign lang="greek">ἐπὶ ἰδίων νόμων</foreign>, cf. <foreign lang="greek">ἐπ’  ἀληθείας</foreign>, <bibl n="Dem. 18.22">&sect; 22</bibl>.1), which may change from year to year, and <gloss>to special facts</gloss> (<foreign lang="greek">ἰδίων ἔργων</foreign>), without regard to the general policy or the traditions of the state: even criminal suits (<foreign lang="greek">γραφαί</foreign>) which involve nothing more than the acts of individuals would be included here. But <foreign lang="greek">δημόσιαι δίκαι</foreign> are suits like the present one, which involve a judgment on the general policy of statesmen (<foreign lang="greek">κοινὰς προαιρέσεις</foreign>), whose acts are not prescribed by special statutes, but must be governed to a great extent by general principles and traditions of state: these, the orator says, must be judged by reference to the glorious deeds of the past. Demosthenes insists here, as elsewhere, that the only real question involved in this case is that of his own statesmanship and his fidelity to the best traditions of Athens, while Aeschines constantly urges the court to treat it as a common <foreign lang="greek">ἰδία δίκη</foreign> and settle it by reference to ordinary facts and petty details. (See Aesch. 199, 200.) Aeschines saw that here lay his only chance of success in his suit. <pb n="131"/>

It is not hard to see why Demosthenes should be unwilling to repeat any part of this brilliant speech. The hope of successes of the allies against Philip, which he probably held out, had been disappointed by the crushing defeat at Chaeronea; and the destruction of Thebes three years later must have made the whole tone of this speech now sadly untimely. Plutarch (Dem. 18) gives a graphic account of the Theban assembly and of the address, which was probably one of the orator's greatest efforts.

<div type="section" n="215">
<p>1. <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ἐκάλουν ὑμᾶς</lemma>, i.e. <gloss>called your army</gloss> to Thebes. This is what Demosthenes provided for in <bibl n="Dem. 18.178">&sect; 178</bibl>.2-4 (see notes), when he proposed to give the embassy concurrent power with the generals over the movements of the army. This march to Thebes, after the answer of the Thebans had been sent to Athens (<foreign lang="greek">μετὰ ταῦτα</foreign>), is commonly thought to be directly opposed to the account of Aeschines in III. 140: Dissen exclaims indignantly, &ldquo;Haeccine manifesta mendacia <pb n="134"/> potuisse coram judicibus dici!&rdquo; But Aeschines says only that the march to Thebes took place <foreign lang="greek">πρὶν περὶ συμμαχίας μίαν μόνην συλλαβὴν γράψαι Δημοσθένην</foreign>. Now that the &ldquo;decree of Demosthenes&rdquo; (181&mdash;187) is known to be a forgery, we have no reason for thinking that any formal treaty of alliance preceded the invitation of the Athenian army to Thebes. Demosthenes could have proposed such a treaty only after his return to Athens. It appears from the criticisms of Aeschines on the treaty (141&mdash;144) that it was an elaborate document; and it is probable that it was not made and ratified until some time after the march to Thebes, which required no further legislation than the decree appointing the ambassadors. It must be remembered that Demosthenes (<bibl n="Dem. 18.178">&sect; 178</bibl>) proposed that the embassy should simply offer the Athenian army to Thebes without insisting on any formal terms, <foreign lang="greek">ἐπαγγέλλεσθαι βοηθήσειν ἂν κελεύωσιν</foreign>.
</p>
<p>3. <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ἔξω...ὄντων</lemma>: this is commonly referred to the Athenian army, who are supposed to have first encamped outside the city and afterwards to have been invited to enter Thebes and occupy the houses. It is surely far more natural and agrees better with the context to understand that, while the Theban infantry and cavalry (i.e. the whole army) were encamped outside the walls, the Athenian army was quartered in the town. The lack of a pronoun to designate which army is meant is felt in both interpretations; but as the subject is the Thebans, it is more natural to refer the absolute clause to them. Again, the emphasis <gloss>given twice</gloss> to <foreign lang="greek">παῖδας καὶ γυναῖκας</foreign> (5 and 13) implies that the men were absent; and <foreign lang="greek">ἐφ’  ὑμῖν ποιήσαντες</foreign> (13), as a testimony to the <foreign lang="greek">σωφροσύνη</foreign> of the Athenians, implies this still more strongly.

Aeschines refers here only to the facts concerning the peace of Philocrates; but Demosthenes chooses to apply the remarks to his whole political life. While Aeschines referred only to the debit side of the account, Demosthenes speaks of both sides, and especially of what stands on the credit side of his own account with the state, including credit for preventing calamities by his judicious policy. He ends (<bibl n="Dem. 18.251">&sect; 251</bibl>) by turning against Aeschines the case of Cephalus, which had been brought up against himself.

Both <foreign lang="greek">δυνάμεις</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">δύναμις</foreign>, however, may denote troops: cf. <bibl n="Dem. 18.237">&sect; 237</bibl>.6, <foreign lang="greek">τῶν πολιτικῶν δυνάμεων</foreign>, and 247.5; so <bibl n="Xen.

<p>2. <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">οὔτε...ἦν</lemma>: this refers to the early part of 340 B.C., when Chios <pb n="145"/> and Rhodes were independent of Athens as the result of the Social War (357&mdash;355 B.C.), but Byzantium, which then followed Chios and Rhodes, had already renewed her friendship (<bibl n="Dem. 18.230">&sect; 230</bibl>.7): see Hist. &sect;<bibl n="Dem. 18.2">&sect; 2</bibl>, 51.

<p>4. <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">χρημάτων σύνταξιν</lemma>: the pay- ment of the original assessment made on the Delian confederacy by Aristides in 478&mdash;477 B.C. was first called <foreign lang="greek">φόρος</foreign> from <foreign lang="greek">φέρω</foreign>, as Thucydides explains it, <foreign lang="greek">οὕτω γὰρ ὠνομάσθη τῶν χρημάτων ἡ φορά</foreign>. The First Athenian Empire made the name odious, so that, when the new federation was formed in 378, the term <foreign lang="greek">σύνταξις</foreign>, <gloss>agreement</gloss>, was adopted for the annual payment.&mdash;<lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">πέντε καὶ τετταράκοντα τάλαντα</lemma>: this sorry amount of 45 talents shows the decline of the power of Athens after the Social War. The original tribute of 460 talents was raised to 600 under Pericles (Thuc. II. 13.23), and (if we may trust Aesch. II. 175 and Plut. Arist. 24) to 1200 or 1300 after the Peace of Nicias, in large part by the allies commuting personal service for payments of money (Thuc. 1. 99).

<p>In this section and <bibl n="Dem. 18.260">&sect; 260</bibl> we have a lively comic description, highly caricatured, of some Asiatic ceremonies of initiation, in which the mother of Aeschines is said to have taken part. This was some form of Bacchic worship, with perhaps a mixture of Orphic mysteries. It seems there was a written service (<foreign lang="greek">τὰς βίβλους</foreign>), which Aeschines read like a clerk while his mother officiated as priestess. The initiation of Strepsiades into the Socratic mysteries (<bibl n="Aristoph. Cl. 255">Ar. Nub. 255</bibl>&mdash;262) probably caricatures some similar worship.
</p>
<p>1. <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">τῇ μητρὶ τελούσῃ</lemma>: see XIX. 281, <foreign lang="greek">Γλαυκοθέας τῆς τοὺς θιάσους συναγούσης, ἐφ’  οἷς ἑτέρα τέθνηκεν ἱέρεια</foreign>, and cf. 249.

</p>
<p>3. <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">νεβρίζων</lemma> and <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">κρατηρίζων</lemma> are probably transitive and govern <foreign lang="greek">τοὺς τελουμένους</foreign>, like <foreign lang="greek">καθαίρων, ἀπομάττων</foreign>, and <foreign lang="greek">ἀνιστάς</foreign>, i.e. <gloss>dressing them in fawnskins and drenching them with wine.</gloss> See Eur.

Suidas gives (under <foreign lang="greek">ἔφυγον...ἄμεινον</foreign>): <foreign lang="greek">τάττεται ἐπὶ τῶν ἀπὸ κακοῦ εἰς κρεῖττον ἐλθόντων</foreign>. The saying originally referred to the change from the acorns and thistles of primitive life to the more civilized bread, and was used at weddings and other ceremonies. The words form a paroemiac, and probably belonged to some metrical formula.

If <foreign lang="greek">τραύματα</foreign> in 6 is referred to wounds received in stealing fruit, compared with those received on the <pb n="163"/> stage or after the play, there is a strange repetition of the latter; if there is a reference (as Westermann suggests) to fruit used in pelting the actors, it is hard to see how figs, grapes, and olives could endanger the lives of the &ldquo;heavy groaners.&rdquo;

<p>All MSS. except <foreign lang="greek">Σ</foreign> have <foreign lang="greek">λιπών</foreign> for <foreign lang="greek">νεκρῶν</foreign>, making the sense of the quotation complete. But such a change is unlikely in quoting so familiar a verse.

<p>6. <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">κακαγγελεῖν...με</lemma>: this verse is otherwise unknown. <foreign lang="greek">κακαγγελεῖν</foreign> must be pres. infin. of <foreign lang="greek">κακαγγελέω</foreign> (otherwise unknown), depending on <foreign lang="greek">θέλοντα</foreign>. The readings of the best MSS., <foreign lang="greek">κακαγγέλλειν</foreign> or <foreign lang="greek">κάκ’  ἀγγέλλειν</foreign> (<foreign lang="greek">Σ</foreign>), are metrically impossible.

<p>7.

<p>Westermann thinks the argument of this section not quite fair, as it is not to be assumed that Aeschines assented to all which he did not oppose. But, apart from the obvious irony of parts of the argument (as in <foreign lang="greek">οὐ γὰρ ἐπ’  εὐνοίᾳ κ.τ.λ.</foreign>), it was surely not too much to expect of the acknowledged &ldquo;leader of the opposition&rdquo; in such a desperate crisis, that he should at least protest strongly against measures of such vital importance as those which he censures afterwards, even if he could not propose any positive measures himself. Now it is an important part of the argument of Demosthenes, that Aeschines <gloss>said nothing whatever</gloss> on such occasions as the sudden seizure of Elatea by Philip. See <bibl n="Dem. 18.191">&sect; 191</bibl>.5, <foreign lang="greek">σοῦ δ’  ἀφώνου...καθημένου</foreign>: see the whole passage, &sect;<bibl n="Dem. 18.188">&sect; 188</bibl>&mdash;191. The only ground on which such neglect can be excused is the one here assumed, that the opposition had no better plan to propose. The plain truth is, of course, that Aeschines really wished to let Philip have his own way at this time.

He retorts by showing that his own oratorical power has always been exerted in behalf of Athens, while that of Aeschines has been used to help her enemies or to gratify personal malice. He refers to the testimony of the citizens in choosing him to deliver the eulogy on those who fell at Chaeronea, as a proof of his patriotism.

<p>EPIGRAM. This cannot be the real epitaph inscribed on the public monument of the heroes of Chaeronea. It has too little poetic merit and too slovenly a style to be accepted as genuine. It is not in the older MSS., and it appears in the Anthol. Graeca, IV. p. 249 (Jacobs). We can be sure of one genuine verse (9), which is quoted by Demosthenes in <bibl n="Dem. 18.290">&sect; 290</bibl>.1 (see note on this verse). A small fragment of an inscription has been found at Athens, cut (acc. to K&ouml;hler) between 350 and 300 B.C., <pb n="178"/> which contains parts of six words of an epigram in the Anthol. Pal. VII. 245: this epigram was evidently inscribed to the heroes of Chaeronea. The full epigram is as follows, the letters found in the inscription being printed in heavy type:&mdash;
</p>
<p/><p><foreign lang="greek">Ὦ Χρόνε, παντοίων θνητοῖς πανεπί- σκοπε δαῖμον</foreign>,
</p>
<p/><p><foreign lang="greek">Ἄγγελος ἡμετέρων πᾶσι γενοῦ πά- θεων</foreign>
</p>
<p/><p><foreign lang="greek">Ὡς ἱερὰν σῴζειν πειρώμενοι Ἑλλάδα χώραν</foreign>
</p>
<p/><p><foreign lang="greek">Βοιωτῶν κλεινοῖς θνῄσκομεν ἐν δαπέ- δοις</foreign>.
</p>
<p>This, though genuine, cannot be the inscription quoted by Demosthenes, as it does not have the verse <foreign lang="greek">μηδὲν... κατορθοῦν</foreign>; but there were undoubtedly many epigrams commemorating the men of Chaeronea.
</p>
<p><gloss>v.</gloss> 1. <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ἔθεντο ὅπλα</lemma>, <gloss>arrayed them- selves</gloss> (lit. <gloss>placed their arms</gloss>): see Arist. Pol.

This is enough to show that the old interpretation of <foreign lang="greek">τίθεσθαι ὅπλα</foreign> (as in Thuc.

</p>
<p><gloss>v.</gloss> 2. <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ἀπεσκέδασαν</lemma>, <gloss>scattered</gloss>, <gloss>brought to nought</gloss>: a patriotic exaggeration as applied to Chaeronea, perhaps referring to some special exploits of the Athenians. Diod. (XVI. 86) says, <foreign lang="greek">μέχρι μέν τινος ὁ ἀγὼν ἀμφιδοξουμένας εἶχε τὰς ἐλπίδας τῆς νίκης</foreign>. Cf. Lycurgus (Leoc. 49), <foreign lang="greek">εἰ δὲ δεῖ καὶ παραδοξότατον μὲν εἰπεῖν ἀληθὲς δὲ, ἐκεῖνοι νικῶντες ἀπέθανον</foreign>.
</p>

<p>Kirchhoff (Hermes VI. pp. 487&mdash; 489) quotes from a MS. scholium: <foreign lang="greek">λέγει δὲ Σιμωνίδης ἐν ἐπιγράμματι ῥηθέντι αὐτῷ ἐπὶ τοῖς Μαραθῶνι πεσοῦσιν Ἀθηναίων τὸν στίχον τοῦτον, Μηδὲν ἁμαρτεῖν ἐστι θεοῦ καὶ πάντα κατορθοῦν</foreign>. See Bergk, Poet. Lyr., Simon. fr. 82, with the note. See Themist. Or. XXII. p. 276 B, <foreign lang="greek">ἐπεὶ δὲ τὸ μηδὲν ἁμαρτάνειν ἔξω τῆς φύσεως κεῖται τῆς ἀνθρωπίνης,...τὸ ἐπίγραμμα ἀληθέστερον ὃ Ἀθήνησιν ἐπιγέγραπται ἐν τῷ τάφῳ τῷ δημοσίῳ· καὶ γὰρ τοῖς θεοῖς μόνοις τὸ πάντα κατορθοῦν ἀπονέμει</foreign>. These two quotations refer to a verse in which &ldquo;never to fail and always to succeed&rdquo; is called a divine prerogative; while in the same words in the inscription quoted by Demosthenes these are called a privilege sometimes granted by the Gods to favoured mortals (see <bibl n="Dem. 18.290">&sect; 290</bibl>). The original verse of Simonides, <foreign lang="greek">μηδὲν... κατορθοῦν</foreign> (without <foreign lang="greek">ἐν βιοτῇ</foreign>), was probably used, as a well-known verse, in the genuine epigram on those who fell at Chaeronea (still without <foreign lang="greek">ἐν βιοτῇ</foreign>), but with a different meaning; and in this new sense it was quoted by Demosthenes in <bibl n="Dem. 18.290">&sect; 290</bibl>. The writer of our epigram probably borrowed the genuine line (perhaps from the text of Demosthenes), and added the whole of <gloss>v.</gloss> 10. See notes of West. and Bl.

He recapitulates some of his chief services in providing Athens with means of defence, and asks what similar claims Aeschines has to the public gratitude (&sect;<bibl n="Dem. 18.301">&sect; 301</bibl>&mdash;313).

It has, I believe, never been asked who these men may have been. There were, of course, many Macedonians in Athens at this time, and there were many Athenians who would welcome news of Macedonian victories. But the greatest Macedonian who ever lived, the philosopher Aristotle, was then a resident in Athens at the head of the Lyceum. His relations with the Court of Pella and with Alexander were most intimate. Who would be more likely <pb n="198"/> to report to Pella, or even to Alexander himself, that Demosthenes had congratulated him on the victory at Arbela, if he had any such pleasant fact to report?

The words <foreign lang="greek">τῶν ...ἀγαθῶν</foreign> more probably refer to the interest of Athens in the reverses of Alexander, which were occasionally reported from Asia. Aeschines (164) describes Demosthenes as once reporting that Alexander was shut up in Cilicia, and <foreign lang="greek">αὐτίκα μάλα ἔμελλε συμπατηθήσεσθαι ὑπὸ τῆς Περσικῆς ἵππου</foreign>. This shows that the mere report of a disaster to Alexander roused the spirit of liberty at Athens, even in her deep humiliation.
